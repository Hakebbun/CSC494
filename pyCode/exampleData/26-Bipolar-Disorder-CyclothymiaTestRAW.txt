 Understanding the Spectrum of Bipolar Disorder By Cheryl Cranick, NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness Feb. 01, 2017 We do a great disservice to people diagnosed with bipolar disorder by ignoring the condition’s types. Too often I see "bipolar disorder" used alone, yet the illness actually exists on a spectrum. For most of my teenage years, I struggled with sadness, lack of energy, rapid mood cycles and suicidal thoughts without knowing the cause of the symptoms. By age 16, I had been diagnosed with OCD and depression, but treatment wasn’t helping. At age 20, my mother found a home screening test to determine if my depression might actually be bipolar disorder. When the results placed me on the spectrum, I was deeply confused. Based on my understanding of the disorder, its symptoms did not match what I experienced. My dominant symptom was depression, and I never reached mania. After receiving a formal diagnosis from a mental health professional, I began to better understand how I could have bipolar disorder without the "typical" symptoms I had heard so often. My condition is bipolar II disorder—I just didn’t know there was more than one type. This was back in the early 2000s, when talking about mental health was still rather hushed. While, we know more now, and we talk more about mental illness, it still seems the bipolar disorder types are often left out. Why the Details Matter Beyond the occasional reference to Types I and II, bipolar disorder is usually grouped as one condition. Ignoring the spectrum prevents the public from better understanding the complexity of this illness, and what’s worse is the prevalence of misdiagnosis. Studies have found 40% of patients with bipolar disorder were initially diagnosed with unipolar (major depression). This does not surprise me. With bipolar II disorder specifically, depression is usually the most common or stronger symptom of the high/low mood scale, whereas manic symptoms may go unreported to a doctor because the elevated (or increased) mood is not severe enough to affect the person's life. Understanding the Spectrum For those who don't know the difference—or want to easily explain the difference to others—I often hold up my two hands. One hand is unipolar (depression). The other hand is bipolar I (manic depression). What exists in the middle is the bipolar II spectrum. Unfortunately, the spectrum is wide and unique to each person. You can also think of the bipolar spectrum as a hill, with unipolar (depression) at the bottom and bipolar (manic depression) at the top. The space between the upward curve is the spectrum and each person with bipolar II disorder exists somewhere along it. The closer a person’s symptoms are to one end, the more likely that person is to receive a diagnosis of major depression or manic depression. With bipolar I, the mania is usually quite clear. In bipolar II, the mania is "milder." Depression is usually present in both, and may be more severe and prevalent in bipolar II. However, these conditions rarely feature across-the-board symptoms for everyone. It's the cluster of symptoms that need to match up for a diagnosis. I am somewhere in the middle. My lows are low and have reached suicide ideation. My mania, however, is classified as "hypo," and expresses itself in behaviors such as talking faster than normal, staying up late with lots of energy or being quick to anger. Educating Others The spectrum is not new to people who live with the disorder, but it is news to many. As a NAMI In Our Own Voice presenter, two responses I received during presentations last year have stuck with me. After sharing my story at a CIT training, one officer asked me: "How am I able to help people in my community if I don't even know this exists?" Months later, while speaking at a NAMI Family-to-Family class, a woman told me about her husband, noting his depression treatment was not working. Visibly relieved, she said: "I've never heard of this. I think you just diagnosed my husband, daughter and sister-in law." While only a health care professional can diagnose, we must be active self-advocates and educators. We must be clear when referencing this illness in hopes that fewer people will endure the pain and frustration that comes with misdiagnosis. For more information on the bipolar spectrum, check out the book: Why Am I Still Depressed? Recognizing and Managing the Ups and Downs of Bipolar II and Soft Bipolar Disorder by Jim Phelps. Cheryl Cranick fictionalized her bipolar II misdiagnosis and severe weight gain into a novel titled Becoming. The book hopes to educate about bipolar II and encourage empathy, as her character struggles through college. Cheryl lives with her two rescue dogs in Jupiter, FL. 
 Three Bipolar Disorder Symptoms No One Wants to Talk About The three symptoms below represent the side of bipolar disorder we all know is there, but we rarely want to let the public know exists. By Julie A. Fast Jan 29, 2015 I know how important it is to protect the reputation of bipolar disorder in the general public. We dont want people thinking we are dangerous, scary, crazy people who cant be trusted. But I do feel we need to own up to the fact that certain mood swings DO cause the behaviors we want to sweep under the carpet. The three symptoms below represent the side of bipolar disorder we all know is there, but we rarely want to let the public know exists. This is only an opinion of course, but Im truly interested to know if you feel the same. #1 Dangerous, aggressive and violent behavior in bipolar disorder I work with parents and partners of those with bipolar disorder. In the majority of situations, people who are in a strong dysphoric manic episode can be dangerous, aggressive and violent. Physical assault and weapons are not uncommon. Many men go to jail because of this behavior when they actually need psychiatric help. People, both men and women who are mild mannered and kind when well, get super human strength along with the aggression- ripping a sink out of the wall- punching through windows- throwing chairs and other dangerous behavior are not uncommon. Families and partners suffer in silence because they are scared to tell anyone about what really goes on at home. I have violent and HOMMICIDAL thoughts when the dysphoric mania is raging. I used to chase down cars if the driver flipped me off or made a strange face. It is not my goal to scare anyone reading this blog. Its my goal that we are honest about these hidden and pushed under the rug symptoms of bipolar disorder. The solution is management. People with bipolar disorder do not have these symptoms unless the mood swings are raging. Prevent the mood swings and you can prevent the dangerous, aggressive and violent behavior. #2 Psychosis in Bipolar Disorder I have rapid cycling bipolar disorder two with psychotic features. I experienced undiagnosed psychotic symptoms from age 19 to 31 when I was finally diagnosed. Ive had hallucinations and delusions all of my adult life. What scares me is that no one and I mean no one educated me about psychosis when I was diagnosed. It was as if the symptoms didnt exist. When I learned the extent of my psychosis, I was appalled that I had lived with it for so long. My symptoms were mostly visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions. I didnt know that others didnt have them as well! If you have bipolar disorder one, there is a 70% chance of full on psychosis when you are in a full blown manic episode. This psychosis can be very bizarre and mimic schizophrenia. The difference? People with bipolar disorder only have psychosis during a manic or depressed mood swing. There is no psychosis outside of depression or mania. If a person has psychosis in between episodes, this is called schizo affective disorder. Do you or your loved ones have psychosis? If bipolar disorder is involved, psychosis could be involved as well. #3 Cognitive Impairment in Bipolar Disorder Many people find this scary. We already have bipolar disorder, does this mean we have memory problems as well? Maybe. Cognitive impairment from memory lapses, forgetting appointments, being unable to remember information and experiencing brain fog during certain episodes is common! If you have bipolar, youve probably felt the sluggish brain that comes with depression. If you havemania, you have probably tripped over your words, said things you dont mean and had trouble thinking in order. READ Discussion: 3 Topics No One Want To Talk About My cognitive symptoms visit me daily. Im not able to remember dates and numbers and need help with calendars and appointments. Mine got worse after [intense therapy I had for severe depression.] Its something I find distressing, but its easy to manage. I want us to be open about cognitive issues. This is the only way we can get help! Mine tend to linger all of the time, but get worse with mood swings. A perfect example of this- I am supposed to put this blog up by midnight the day of my blog slot. I reminded myself all day yesterday to put it up, but still managed to go to sleep without posting it on time. I have to live with these symptoms and even though a few things slip through, I do control the majority of my minor memory problems with a good support system! Heres the good news- yes, there is good news! Bipolar disorder is an episodic illness. We have all of our symptoms while in a mood swing. This means we are STABLE when we are not in a mood swing. The symptoms I list above usually go away when the illness is successfully managed. It can take regular monitoring for those of us who have daily symptoms. Others who have long breaks between mood swings may even forget the symptoms even existed. This is why we must have a management plan that can recognize the dangerous, aggressive and violent behavior, psychosis and cognitive impairment as soon as it begins. I know we want to protect our reputations around this illness. We dont want to be seen as different or freaks. But I ask that within our community, we get brutally honest about what really happens to those of us with the illness. Its the ONLY way to stop the symptoms and make them stay away forever! Julie 
 Manic Depression by Robert T. Muller, York University December 4, 2016 The song Manic Depression by Jimi Hendrix exposes the frustrating mess of this illness, now known as bipolar disorder. Hendrix himself was never diagnosed as bipolar, but he paints an insightful picture of the hopelessness felt by many who have been. He also mentions that music may have been his salvation, hinting at musics therapeutic value. 
 10 Ways to Prevent Mania and Hypomania by Therese Borchard, World of Psychology July 31, 2016 Bipolar disorder is one of the most difficult illnesses to treat because by addressing the depression part of the illness, you can inadvertently trigger mania or hypomania. Even in Bipolar II, where the hypomania is less destabilizing than the often-psychotic manic episodes of Bipolar I, persons often experience from a debilitating depression that cant be lifted by mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. Antidepressants, though, can cause a person with bipolar to cycle between hypomania and depression. I have worked with psychiatrists who were too afraid of cycling to risk using antidepressants for bipolar patients. They put me strictly on mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. However, I did not get well. I stayed depressed, and all original thoughts in my brain vanished. My current psychiatrist knows that depression is my primary threat, not so much the hypomania, so she was able to pull me out of the depression with the right combination of antidepressants, but is vigilant for any signs of hypomania. Because I know how vulnerable I am to hypomania, I have learned several strategies to help me stay grounded. By making them part of my life, I have been able to take less lithium, my mood stabilizer, which ensures that I continue producing original thoughts and not get too medicated. Here are 10 tools I use to avert hypomania: 1. Practice Good Sleep Hygiene Developing good sleep habits is by far the most potent tool for preventing mania and hypomania. There are a handful of studies documenting that sleep deprivation is associated with mania and hypomania. By going to bed at 10 every night and sleeping a good eight or nine hours, we have the power to stop rapid cycling and to reverse mania or hypomania. In a study published in Biological Psychiatry a rapid-cycling patient was asked to remain on bed rest in the dark for 14 hours each night (gradually reduced to 10 hours). Times of sleeping and waking were recorded with sleep logs, polygraph recordings, and computer-based event recordings. His sleep and mood stabilized when he adhered to a regimen of long nightly periods of enforced bed rest in the dark. The abstracts conclusion: Fostered sleep and stabilizing its timing by scheduling regular nightly periods of enforced bed rest in the dark may help to prevent mania and rapid cycling in bipolar patients. Good sleep hygiene means you go to bed at the same time every night, ideally before 10:30 p.m.  not one night 2 a.m. and another night 7 p.m.; you sleep at least eight hours a night; and you wake at the same time in the morning. Since many folks with bipolar disorder have sleep disorders, a nighttime routine is often needed. For example, I shut down my computer at 8 p.m. and try not to check my emails or messages on my phone. Reading a disconcerting email at 9 p.m. will keep me up all night. It takes me a good two hours to calm down, so I get out the lavender oil around 8:30 p.m., pull out a real book (not an iBook), and begin to tell my body it needs to seriously chill out. 2. Limit Your Screen Time CNN did a story a few years ago on iPads (or LCD screens) and sleep. Journalist John D. Sutter asked Phyllis Zee, MD, a neuroscience professor at Northwestern and director of the schools Center for Sleep & Circadian Biology, if our gadgets can disturb sleep patterns and exacerbate insomnia. Dr. Zee said: Potentially, yes, if youre using [the iPad or a laptop] close to bedtime  that light can be sufficiently stimulating to the brain to make it more awake and delay your ability to sleep. And I think more importantly, it could also be sufficient to affect your circadian rhythm. This is the clock in your brain that determines when you sleep and when you wake up. I absolutely know that to be true because for awhile I was reading iBooks for a half-hour before bed and staying awake until 2 a.m. My concern with LCD screens isnt limited to bedtime. I know from people in my depression community that persons with bipolar disorder have to be careful with LCD screens at all times, as they can make the highly sensitive person hypomanic if the person doesnt take a break from them. For me and for many fragile persons with bipolar, looking into an LCD screen for too long is like keeping your light therapy sunbox on all day. I made the mistake of firing up that baby from 9 p.m. to midnight right after I got it, and I did not sleep one iota the next day, and felt hypomanic all day long. Keep in mind that not only is the light stimulating, but so is all of the messages and tagging and poking  especially if you have as many social media handles as I do. 3. Avoid Certain People and Places Most of us have a few people in our lives that appear as though theyve downed three shots of espresso every time we see them. They are usually great fun and make us laugh. However, the hyperactivity isnt what you need if you havent slept well in a few weeks and are trying to calm down your body and mind. Same goes with places. I dont dare step foot inside the mall, for example, between Halloween and New Years. There is just too much stuff being forced in front of my face. I also hate Toys-R-Us. I still have nightmares about the time my husband pressed three dozen Tickle Me Elmos and the entire shelf began to shake. 4. Pay Attention to Your Body and Breathe Deeply Before attending the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program modeled after the one developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, I did not pay attention to my bodys cues preceding a hypomanic episode. In fact, it was usually another person who would point out the embarrassing truth  like the time my editor wrote a letter to my doctor after I started publishing eight blogs a day thinking my traffic would go up. Now, though, when my heart races and I feel as though I have consumed eight cups of coffee, I know this is my opportunity to reverse my symptoms by doing lots of deep breathing exercises. Of all the automatic functions of the body  cardiovascular, digestive, hormonal, glandular, immune  only the breath can be easily controlled voluntarily, explain Richard P. Brown, MD, and Patricia L. Gerbarg, MD, in their book The Healing Power of the Breath. They write: By voluntarily changing the rate, depth, and pattern of breathing, we can change the messages being sent from the bodys respiratory system to the brain. In this way, breathing techniques provide a portal to the autonomic communication network through which we can, by changing our breathing patterns, send specific messages to the brain using the language of the body, a language the brain understands and to which it responds. Messages from the respiratory system have rapid, powerful effects on major brain centers involved in thought, emotion, and behavior. 5. Eliminate Caffeine A good caffeine rush mimics hypomania. You feel more alive, more alert, like you could actually contribute something of worth to the world. Thats all fine and dandy except when you are teetering on the hypomanic edge. Caffeine can provide the ever-so-subtle push to the other side, especially if you arent sleeping well, which is when most people most crave caffeine. Stephen Cherniske, MS, calls caffeine Americas number one drug in his book Caffeine Blues because of the withdrawal our body goes through three hours after weve drank a cup of coffee or a Diet Coke. Persons with bipolar are even more sensitive to amphetamine-like substances that raise dopamine levels, so the safest way to prevent hypomania is to eliminate the stuff altogether. 6. Exercise My best workouts have been when Im either on the verge of becoming hypomanic or when I am ticked off. My usual 10-minute mile goes down to an eight. I start passing people along my route, at the Naval Academy, feeling like Lynda Carter in her Wonder Woman getup. And my swim interval is consistent with the people who swam across the Chesapeake Bay in under two hours. The truth is I have averted many hypomanic episodes by working out until I collapse or at least become tired, which can take a few hours. Two years ago, the only way I was able to sleep was by swimming more than 300 laps a day. There are people for whom vigorous exercise triggers mania, but most experts report on the benefits of exercise for bipolar disorder. 7. Watch Your Sweets There is a reason why ice cream, Swedish Fish, and animal crackers are comfort food for the bipolar person. The rush of insulin generated by those foods will calm those carbohydrate-craving brain pathways for a bit, until a crash in blood sugar has the person binging again on sweets. Its a vicious cycle, one that can keep a bipolar person cycling indefinitely. I will tell you a true story about sugar and bipolar. About 16 years ago, before I knew I was allergic to sugar and that a high-carb diet was the worst thing I could do for my mental health, I would sometimes drink two bottles of Arizona Iced Tea and eat two or three chocolate-chip oatmeal bars for lunch. One day, there was a Horizon milk truck in front of our house with a large cow on the side. I started mooing at the cow. My new husband, behind me, was truly frightened by this and told me to lay off the Arizona Iced Teas and granola bars for awhile. I havent mooed at a truck since. 8. Be Careful With the Opposite Sex I am all for good, healthy friendships between men and women. If youre not bipolar. Consider me a prude, but I know how difficult it can be to be consistent with good boundaries if you are even the tiniest bit hypomanic. You sincerely didnt mean for something you sent in an email to sound flirtatious  you were just being playful, like you are with your girlfriends. However, when you do get a reaction from a person of the opposite sex, something in the least bit flattering, that communication can ignite a rush that sends a signal throughout your entire body that you want more of the feel-good hormone it just experienced  dopamine, essentially. Its even riskier if you have a history of substance abuse and bipolar because your body will compromise any moral agreements you have signed off on prior to that email in order to get that damn rush again. If youre not careful, this dangerous game will trigger a full blown manic episode. I have had the best intentions with 85-year-old men, and still, somehow, found myself in trouble. So for the time being, Im sticking to female friendships. 9. Use a Shopping List One of the most common manic behaviors is uncontrollable spending or shopping. Therefore, it is sometimes helpful for persons with bipolar disorder to make out a list beforehand of the items you absolutely need to buy  be it a grocery list, a Home Depot run, or a mission to get a your daughters friend a birthday gift. That way you wont end up with 20 different kinds of paint swatches for the kitchen and living room youve decided to paint while you were at the store. 10. Allow Time to Decompress This one is probably the second most important for me to prevent mania. I would say meditate, but that word produces too much expectation and pressure for me right now. Decompressing means after you finish something like a blog post or after youve forced yourself to be social for a few hours at a party that you didnt want to attend, you allow yourselves 15 to 30 minutes to look at the ceiling fan in your bedroom and think about just that: the ceiling fan. The case has been made that persons with bipolar disorder are creative and therefore need more chill time than the average person. Our brains are operating at a faster pace and more intensely than our non-bipolar friends for the periods of time where we must appear normal. So it is absolutely imperative that we allow some time where nothing is required  where we can drool, or lie in the grass, or doodle, or collapse in front of the front door. Although it seems as though these hours are unproductive, this activity will rebuild the gray matter of our brains and safeguard us from a manic episode. 
 
 
 Living with Bipolar by Robert T. Muller, York University July 5, 2016 Student Laura Bain lives with bipolar disorder and describes her condition in this thought-provoking TEDx Talk. She illustrates the turmoil of what life is like for her when the illness makes her feel out of control. 
 A High IQ May Also Have This Mental Cost, Psychologists Find PsyBlog 24 August 2015 Disorders of mood could be the price some people pay for high intelligence, new research finds. Psychologists have found that higher childhood IQ is linked to features of bipolar disorder in young adulthood. The research adds fuel to the debate over the connection between intelligence, creativity and mental health issues. For the research 1,881 people were followed from age 8 until they were 22 or 23-years-old. Their IQ was measured along with any characteristics of mood disorders. The results showed that having ten more IQ points at age 8 was linked to being in the top ten per cent for having manic personality traits in their early twenties. Professor Daniel Smith, one of the studys authors said: A possible link between bipolar disorder and intelligence and creativity has been discussed for many years and many studies have suggested a link. In this large study, we found that better performance on IQ tests at age eight predicted bipolar features in young adulthood. We are not saying that high childhood IQ is a clear-cut risk factor for bipolar disorder but rather that there is likely to be a shared biology between intelligence and bipolar disorder which needs to be understood more fully. Many other factors  including family history of mental illness, childhood adversity, stressful life events and drug misuse  are known to increase an individuals risk of developing bipolar disorder. Our finding has implications for understanding of how liability to bipolar disorder may have been selected through generations. One possibility is that serious disorders of mood such as bipolar disorder are the price that human beings have had to pay for more adaptive traits such as intelligence, creativity and verbal proficiency. This work will inform future genetic studies at the interface of intelligence, creativity and bipolar disorder, and will help with efforts to improve approaches to the earlier detection of bipolar disorder in adolescents and young adults. The study was published in the British Journal of Psychiatry (Smith et al., 2015). 
 Ever-changing moods may be toxic to the brain of bipolar patients Science Daily May 31, 2016 Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe and complex mental illness with a strong genetic component that affects 2% of the world population. The disorder is characterized by episodes of mania and depression that may alternate throughout life and usually first occur in the early 20s. Most recently, physicians have started to group patients as early or late-stage. Early-stage BD patients are classified as those who have had fewer episodes of either mania or depression whereas late-stage patients have had more episodes with more severe effects and are less likely to respond to treatment. This classification between early- and late-stage BD patients has more to do with episode recurrence and severity than the length of time the patient has had the disease. BD diagnosis may be difficult to establish and may take up to 10 years from the first episode. There is no cure for BD but psychotherapy and prescription medication such as antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and benzodiazepines may alleviate symptoms. The brain of bipolar patients shows changes such as reduction in volume and neuroprogression. The latter is a pathological version of an otherwise normal mechanism by which the brain re-writes its neuronal connections, a process that is associated to learning, memory and even recovery from brain damage. In bipolar patients, the process is associated with loss of neuron connections and clinical and neurocognitive deterioration. A previous study has shown that the blood levels of several markers related to inflammation, oxidative stress and neurotrophins (proteins that promote neuron growth and survival) in BD patients are associated to recurrent mood episodes. For instance, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that promotes neuron growth and survival and helps establishing neuron connections, is lower in BD patients, as is the early-growth response 3 (EGR3), a protein associated to helping the brain cope with environmental changes such as stressful stimuli. Besides these alterations, another study has shown that abnormally low levels of chemokines (which are proteins that send signals to other cell components) have also been observed in the blood of BD patients. If these blood markers can be associated to the severity and frequency of mood episodes in BD patients, is it possible that they are also associated to changes observed in the brain of BD patients? To answer this intriguing question, a group led by Fabio Klamt at the Laboratory of Cellular Biochemistry at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), and Flávio Kapczinski at the Laboratory of Molecular Psychiatry at Clinics Hospital of Porto Alegre (HCPA), in Brazil, exposed differentiated neurons to blood serum from either healthy normal individuals or bipolar patients. The group then observed that neurons exposed to serum from bipolar patients had a significant loss in the density of neurites, which is used to estimate the number of neuron connections, if compared to neurite density of neurons exposed to serum from healthy individuals. Interestingly, when serum from early-stage and late-stage BD patients was analyzed separately, no difference in neurite density was observed between neurons exposed to serum from early-stage patients and those exposed to healthy controls' serum. However, a significant difference remained in the neurite density between neurons exposed to serum from late-stage patients and from early-stage patients or healthy controls. The group also found that the number of neurons was not that different between samples, except for those exposed to serum from patients at very late stages of the disease. "Our results indicate that the blood of BD patients is toxic to brain cells and affects the connectivity ability of neurons. Considering our previous knowledge on the association between mood episodes and blood toxicity, we believe that the more episodes a patient has, the more cellular components are produced that impair the brain's ability to deal with environmental changes, inflammation and stress," says Klamt. This is the first study to show the toxic effects of BD serum on human neuronal cells and to present an in vitro study model for a disease for which no animal model has been yet developed. Future studies should focus on finding drugs that can protect BD brain cells from the toxic effects of their own blood.

 Fish Oil for Bipolar Disorder in Children By James Phelps, MD May 12, 2016 The very existence of pre-pubertal bipolar disorder remains somewhat controversial,1-3 although several US research groups consistently identify and study it (eg, at Stanford University4 and at Washington University in St. Louis5). Another such group, at Harvard, has just published an important study of treatment in pre-pubertal and peri-pubertal children with bipolar symptoms. The combination of fish oil and inositol produced, in a small sample, results better than either alone (inositol < fish oil < combination).6 This study is notable for several reasons, independent of the results, which themselves suggest an important alternative to pharmaceutical treatments may be at hand. First, whereas child/adolescent psychiatrists are usually forced to extrapolate to their population from research done in adults, here may be a case of the reverse: these researchers may have found a treatment approach worthy of consideration in adults with bipolar disorder. Second, this work was done in the pediatric psychopharmacology research program at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston, by Joseph Biederman, MD, and colleagues.6 They have been criticized for aggressive diagnosis and treatment of very young children.7 Dr Biederman was sanctioned for links to the pharmaceutical industry.8 But with this study they have addressed these criticisms, at least in part. Indeed, their new work may take some pressure off the need to firmly diagnose bipolar disorder. If a very low-risk alternative exists, treatment can begin without having to wait for the high degree of certainty needed to justify use of medications commonly regarded as first line for bipolar disorder in children, such as risperidone and aripiprazole (per their oft-cited FDA indications: eg, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrys Parents Medication Guide for Bipolar Disorder in Children & Adolescents9[PDF]). The bottom line The bottom line of their small pilot study: fish oil plus inositol was significantly better than fish oil alone, which was superior to inositol alone in most primary outcomes. The sample was small, the dropout rate was nearly 50%, and the children were only moderately symptomatic, so conclusions are limited. However, the results quite strongly suggest that adding inositol to fish oil makes the omega-3s work better. What dosages? In fish oil studies in adults, doses have been quite variable, but an important meta-analysis suggests that there is a threshold for efficacy. Few studies of fish oil for depression found it better than placebo if the dose was less than 1 gram of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) per day andcriticallythe composition was at least 60% EPA (ie, EPA/EPA plus docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]). If anything, the EPA content relative to DHA was more important than its total dose: 2 studies that used lower doses but over 60% EPA had positive results.10 In the new study by Biedermans group, all participants received the same dose of 975 mg of EPA per day regardless of their weight, using a version that was 59.1% EPA. Although there was no placebo arm in this study to determine whether 59% EPA at that dose was actually better than placebo, it was statistically better than inositol, which served as a so-called active comparator in lieu of a placeboan ethical decision in this study population. The dose of inositol was roughly 80 mg/kg, for doses of 1500 to 2000 mg/d. Adverse effects? Because the sample was so small, this is hard to evaluate for certain, but there were no worrisome outcomes related to study medications. Subjects who took fish oil had more gastrointestinal (GI) complaints than those who took inositol alone (5/17 versus 1/7). Note that the dose was not weight-adjusted and was only 25 mg less than the 1 gram of EPA thought necessary for adults; perhaps a slightly lower dose might be sufficient and cause less GI distress. Is the addition of inositol the key to making fish oil really work as a mood stabilizer? Children in this study were 5 to 12 years old. They had been diagnosed with bipolar spectrum disorder (bipolar I or II or not otherwise specified). Diagnoses were established by an experienced clinician whose interview was supplemented with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children: Epidemiologic Version. Exclusions included a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) over 40. Thus, as the authors emphasize, generalizability is limited to children with mild to moderate manic symptoms. In addition to significant reductions in YMRS, this small study also found significant reductions in depression scores and, interestingly, in anxiety scores as well. Perhaps the addition of inositol is the key to making fish oil really work as a mood stabilizer? A larger trial of similar design (same 3 arms of inositol, omega-3, and combination, compared) is recruiting at the Massachusetts General Hospital teams site, due for completion in January 2017 (NCT01396486). Thanks to Dr Biederman and his group for this work on a non-pharmaceutical option for children with mild to moderate symptomsthe child literature leading the way for adult research this time.

 Adults with bipolar disorder at equal risk for anxiety or depression following mania Study suggests re-thinking definition of bipolar disorder to include anxiety Science Daily May 3, 2016 Adults with bipolar disorder are just as likely to develop anxiety as depression following an episode of mania, according to data from a national survey of more than 34,000 adults. This finding, published today in Molecular Psychiatry, may expand our understanding of bipolar disorder to include anxiety. An estimated 5.7 million Americans have bipolar disorder, a serious mental illness that has been characterized by recurrent periods of mania and depression. Because mania, which involves having an elevated or irritable mood, and depression are mood disturbances, bipolar disorder is considered a type of mood disorder. Study participants were interviewed to determine the incidence of manic episodes. A second interview was conducted three years later to determine the subsequent incidence of depression or anxiety. Participants with mania had an approximately equal risk of developing depression (odds ratio of 1.7) or anxiety (odds ratio of 1.8). Both conditions were significantly more common among participants with than without mania. In addition, participants with depression had a significantly higher risk of developing mania (odds ratio of 2.2) or anxiety (odds ratio of 1.7) compared to those without depression. Results of the report align with earlier research demonstrating that depression and anxiety commonly co-occur, and with twin studies indicating that depression and a common form of anxiety known as generalized anxiety disorder behave virtually as the same genetic condition. The new findings extend the close connection between depression and anxiety to individuals with bipolar disorder who have experienced episodes of mania. "Although it has long been widely assumed that bipolar disorder represents repeated episodes of mania and depression as poles along a single continuum of mood, the clinical reality is often far more complex," said Mark Olfson, MD, MPH, professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, research psychiatrist at New York State Psychiatric Institute, and lead author of the report. "The link between mania and anxiety suggests that patients whose main symptom is anxiety should be carefully assessed for a history of mania before starting treatment." A broader clinical definition of bipolar disorder that includes episodes of mania along with anxiety or depression might lead to earlier identification of individuals with bipolar disorder and different approaches to treatment. "For years, we may have missed opportunities to evaluate the effects of treatments for bipolar disorder on anxiety," said Dr. Olfson. "The results of our study suggest that researchers should begin to ask whether, and to what extent, treatments for bipolar disorder relieve anxiety as well as mania and depression."

 Living in a Mixed State By Laura Yeager, World of Psychology April 13, 2016 You thought depression was tough. You thought mania was exhausting. Well, get ready for something really awful  the mixed state. Depression and mania mingle to produce an excruciating, unending, torturous feeling. The mixed state has got to be the worst feature of bipolar illness. You feel both hopeless and electrified at once. Ones body and mind do not know how to process the mixture. One is miserable, and one is also miserable to live with. Youre moving so fast mentally that you have no patience, zero tolerance for anything. If any little thing goes wrong, you fly off the handle and never seem to find your equilibrium again. Since Ive been in this mixed state, Ive developed an awful habit of cussing. Ive been swearing like a sailor. And mean! The mixed state can make you mean. You cant help it. You feel so terrible, so pulled at both ends. You feel like you might snap in half at any minute. I got this way because my psychiatrist took me off my antidepressants. He noticed that I was not depressed anymore, and he decided to do away with the drugs. I went off both Cymbalta and Imipramine. Those little pills had kept me stable. When I was on them, I didnt have a cussing problem. I was calm, happy; I rarely got angry. Going off of them has destabilized me, my psychiatrist says. My body is trying to compensate for their disappearance. My body doesnt know whether its up or down. The positive side is that Im incredibly productive. Ive been writing at least one article a day for the past several weeks. For a writer, this mixed state can be seen as a boon. The energy in the mind seeps out and onto the page. In fact, only when Im writing do I feel normal. I guess this is because Im channeling the excessive good and bad energy into something relatively concrete. Although living with this strange mental state is difficult, the people I feel sorry for are my family members. They never know when Im going to burst into tears or wet my pants from laughing uncontrollably. My son has begun to eye me suspiciously, like he doesnt really know who I am anymore. Thank God they love me. And thank God Ive got some good credit built up with them. All those years I was stable on medication that I (and they) could depend on has made them trust me. Theyre just waiting for the old me to return. The worst part is that my psychiatrist wont do a thing to get me out of this mess. He says hes waiting for me to stabilize, whatever that means. I think it means hes waiting for me to leave this mixed state, for he cant do anything while Im in it. If he gives me antidepressants for the depression Im feeling, hell boost the existing mania. If he gives me anti-mania medication, hell dampen my mood and might make me even more depressed. So I have to just wait this out. I do find a bit of relief from an occasional Lorazepam. I pop one of these at night to help me sleep. Focus on the positive. Focus on the positive. I did get an interesting blog post out of my horrendous condition. Its a bit self-reflexive. A self-reflexive blog post is better than no blog post at all. Right? 
 Touched with Fire: A Film about Bipolar and Artistic Genius By Paul Dalio, PsychCentral.com 26 Jan 2016 My name is Paul Dalio. I’m a filmmaker, husband of my NYU film school classmate, father of two children, and bipolar. Of these labels, the one I’m certain stands out in your mind is bipolar — and not in a good way. That’s no fault of your own, since you probably don’t know much about it, other than what you’ve heard.So how do I deal with this label? What other label do I have to choose from that’s not a disorder, disease, illness, or defect in my humanity? I remember when I received the label at age 24. All every medical book had to offer was that if I stayed on these meds, which made me feel no emotion, I could live a “reasonably normal life.” I didn’t know exactly what that meant, but I was pretty sure it sounded like “just get by.” Six months later, I came across a book, Touched with Fire, by Kay Jamison. It was the first medical text showing a tangible correlation between bipolar and artistic genius, profiling some of the greatest artists in history. For the first time, I heard words, shining right through every medical book’s thick printed clinical ink, describing something I could be proud to be. I was like, “Yeah, that’s what I am. I’m ‘touched with fire.'” It would be destructive for me to deny all four seasons of the bipolar fire. When summer’s mania exceeds its stay and the fall shadows grab hold of your brain, you can feel your will within each withering leaf clinging to the trees of the entire forest surrounding you, slipping as they fall down on you. And then when winter rolls around, your soul retreats deep beneath the frozen ground and it’s calling your body down, it feels like your ashes are fighting gravity. And when spring returns, it extends a warm invitation to rise too high and repeat the bipolar cycle that will lay waste to your lives. Likewise, it would be unwise for a doctor to deny that on those manic summer nights when we look out our hospital windows we can see the stars pulsing spirals of fire across the sky, as God lifts the veil and unfolds the entire universe before our eyes, because we know that humanity’s most beloved image of the sky was seen through a sanitarium window with Van Gogh’s manic eyes. The reason why it would be unwise for a doctor to deny this reality is because if the doctor acknowledged that maybe it wasn’t just some misfiring synapse flashing through a crack in our minds, maybe it was something special — he would also be able to remind the patient that while Van Gogh may have seen that sky through manic eyes, he didn’t paint it while he was manic, because he didn’t need the mania to have the fire. And that doctor would then be able to assure the patient that he or she doesn’t want to stomp out that fire. That over time, with gradual adjustments in medications, the doctor (and patient) would work together to make sure the patient keeps that fire, and sustains it without letting it get out of control and burn down his mind. How much more receptive would a patient be to treatment if the patient was told that the treatment was to nurture a gift, instead of terminating a disease? However, in order for this to work, the doctor has to be able to trust the patient just as much as the patient has to be able to trust the doctor. My doctor trusted me. He saw I was impeccable with my health habits, patient, and I would be satisfied without mania. In return, he was never satisfied until I felt I had full, rich emotion. I now feel deeper, richer emotion and more creativity than I ever did before bipolar — to the point that I can call it a gift, so much that given the opportunity I wouldn’t want a “cure.” Still, I know I’ll always walk a tightrope. But you get better at it over time, and like the guy who crossed between the Twin Towers, you learn not to fall, and the higher the stakes and tighter the wire, the stronger and more disciplined you’re forced to become in order to survive. It’s only when things are so dark you can’t see hope one inch in front of your eyelids and it’s so cold, your soul is numb that you don’t even know if it still exists, when just as your dim glow is this close to being blown out by your own lips, a sudden spark of grit and will to live breaks into a flame of desperation, raging to blaze its way into the light of day again. So by the time you finally rise, the light in all those sunbathing souls combined could not hold a candle to the fire in just one of your eyes. And when you combine that with the bipolar fire, no matter what anyone labels you, that is something they can’t deny. Inspired by his own experience of being bipolar, Paul Dalio wrote, directed, edited and scored Touched with Fire, his feature-film debut starring Katie Holmes and Luke Kirby. Touched with Fire will be released theatrically on February 12, 2016. Learn more at www.touchedwithfire.com. 
 Stop Trying to Stop Enabling Bipolar Behavior By Candida Fink, MD, PsychCentral: Bipolar Beat 5 Nov 2015 Sandra lives with bipolar disorder. I am her psychiatrist or p-doc or shrink (as in Dr. Fink, the shrink). Sandra (not her real name), and I have worked together for many years. At todays appointment, she is moving a little slowly due to some back pain, but she tells me that her mood and energy have remained steady. That is outstanding news, because until a couple of months ago she was experiencing a terrible mood episode that rocked her lifea difficult mixed episode (mania and depression), along with substance use and memory and thinking problems. Her symptoms disrupted relationships with her family and worsened existing financial troubles. But, fortunately, her mood and energy level have not wavered to any clinically significant degree. Today she smiles and tells me about her volunteer work and playing tennis with a friend. Then she stops, and she cries softly and asks me how to help her parents understand what is wrong with her. While the good news is that many people in Sandras life are starting to grasp that bipolar disorder is the problem (and that Sandra is not the problem), her own family of origin shuns and shames her, telling her that they have been advised to stop enabling her bad behavior. They will not let her come to stay with them, and she has been excluded from family events. Sandra is heartbroken. Using the Stop Enabling Advice to Withdraw Love and Compassion I have heard the term enabling countless times in my practicein a range of settings, from spouses of adults with bipolar disorder to parents of children with anxiety and depression. Unfortunately, the term is often misused, as in the situation with Sandras family. The language of enabling comes from the substance use recovery movement and refers to behaviors that directly or indirectly reinforce someones substance use. This approach encourages those who love someone with substance use disorder to allow the natural consequences of the disorder to happen, which theoretically will motivate the person with the disorder to enter into recovery. How well this approach has been studied, or if it is effective, is unclear, but the concept has taken hold in popular culture and has expanded quickly into mental health and child development/parenting. Enabling, the theory goes, is counterproductive to the tough love that is needed for someone to experience and learn from the negative outcomes of their bad behaviors. Unfortunately, those who use this language often extend the definition of enabling to cover emotional support, warmth, and compassion toward someone who is not getting better. Addressing the Misconceptions behind the Stop Enabling Advice I feel as though I tread in delicate territory when I try to re-consider this approachbecause it has been so soundly absorbed into common wisdom and accepted truth, but it is based on some profound misconceptions. So I try to help loved ones recognize the misconceptions that underlie the stop enabling advice by pointing out the following facts: Psychiatric symptoms are not bad behaviors that change based on external motivators. The inactivity of depression, the irritability of anxiety, the impulsivity of mania, to name a few, arent choices that people can change based on the consequences of their behavior. In fact, people who are suffering with psychiatric illness despair over their inability to make change even as things are falling apart around themor when they re-gain their clear thinking they are racked with guilt over damage done.Those struggling with mental illness need ongoing love and care, even when their symptoms make them seem unlovable. Withholding your love or your support causes more despair and guilt, layering onto their mood and behavioral symptoms in ways that are bound to actually make things worse.Mental illness breaks many things in someones life. Sometimes resources for even basic life needs are erodedpersonal finances, occupation, education, nutrition, hygiene, sleep. The idea that just letting someone struggle until they figure it out is profoundly ineffective, not to mention mean-spirited. Things will predictably get worse. But if you are still misattributing your loved ones challenges to their own choices, you will see this as proof that they just dont want to get well. Recognizing the Complexities Of course there are complexities here. People suffering with acute mania, for example, may reject all help and care because the illness prevents them from seeing that they are ill. But getting angry and rejecting them will not make it better. You may have to stop trying to convince them of something that they cannot understand, but expressing your love and support will not enable their mania. You may have to set boundaries for your own health and safety, but that isnt the same as purposely withdrawing yourself, with the idea that it will help your loved one get better. Shutting someone out is not helping. Connection and love are not enabling. While this is not the terms original meaning or intent, it is often misinterpreted and used in dangerous ways, as my patients family had been advised to do. Reconnecting with Loved Ones Sandra and I sort through some of these ideas and try to come up with ways to help her parents and brothers begin to question some of their assumptions about enabling. Sandra feels great relief at the re-building of her life with her wife and kids, but there is a big hole where her own family has stepped out of the picture, thinking that they are doing the right thing. Sandra wipes her tears and heads back out into the world, where her illness remains vastly misunderstood and compassion can be hard to come by.

 How to Care for and Cope With a Bipolar Spouse Health.com If you're involved with someone with bipolar disorder, the romantic relationship may be exciting, exhausting, and stressful. But it will rarely be easy, especially if the object of your affection doesn't comply fully with treatment. Bipolar disorder can be nearly as traumatic for the partners of those with the disorder as it is for the patients themselves. The episodes of depression and mania that bipolar people experience—which can lead to emotional withdrawal, out-of-the-blue accusations and outbursts, spending sprees, and everything in between—have been shown to induce stress, sexual dissatisfaction, and money worries in their partners, as well as depression. Depressive phases, during which the bipolar partner feels hopeless and sad, can drag a healthy partner down, too. "Mental illness is, on some levels, a contagious disease," says David Karp, PhD, a professor of sociology at Boston College who has studied interpersonal dynamics within bipolar couples. "It brings out very strong negative emotions and feelings of isolation in the partner, who struggles so hard to separate the illness from the patient." Relatively few studies have been conducted on the effects of bipolar disorder on relationships, but the research is nearly unanimous that the disorder tends to cause both practical and emotional difficulties for couples. For starters, the ups and downs of bipolar disorder can disrupt the rhythms and routines of a household. In a 2005 survey of people with bipolar partners published in Bipolar Disorders, more than half of the participants reported that their partners illness had reduced their socializing, required them to assume more household responsibilities, forced them to take time off of work, and caused financial strain. The participants also reported that their sex lives sagged when their partner was in a manic or a depressive phase; three-quarters of the women who were interviewed and 53% of the men complained of infrequent sex when their spouses were depressed. Another study of bipolar caregivers found that 86% of the participants characterized the stress they experienced as a result of their partners illness as "major." And 9 out of 10 said they found it difficult to keep the relationship going. Building a team for support Many people enter into relationships with a bipolar person unwittingly, thinking it will be smooth sailing, says Adele Viguera, MD, a psychiatrist at the Cleveland Clinic who works with bipolar couples seeking to start a family. "Maybe they meet the person when the person is hypomanic, not realizing that mood can change," she says. Tim, 37, tried for three years to sustain a relationship with a woman eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder. "She would cycle between extreme happiness and depression," he says, recalling her paranoia, impulsiveness, and self-destructive insecurity. "She broke up with me and started dating other people, and then when I dated other people she tried to win me back." Like many people with bipolar disorder, Tim's girlfriend also struggled with drug and alcohol addiction and got deep into debt—with his credit card. Tim eventually broke down emotionally himself, ended the affair, and tried to forget the experience. "Half of me moved on, but half of me will always love her," he says. Divorce and separation are common in relationships involving bipolar disorder, but according to Dr. Viguera, such relationships don't have to be destructive and separation is hardly inevitable. Both parties have to participate in its success, however. "Taking care of bipolar disorder is a team effort, involving the two people and a psychiatrist or other mental health professional," she says. While she would never speak to a spouse without her patients consent, such open communication empowers both parties to make treatment decisions that lead to a healthier relationship. Mental health professionals aren’t the only ones who can lend a hand. The stigma of mental illness can make couples hesitant to look elsewhere for help, but Karp emphasizes that extended family members and trusted friends can all provide invaluable support. "Spread it around a little bit," he says. "People need support systems. By keeping the illness a secret, people place an additional burden on themselves." Karp also recommends that anyone who cares for someone struggling with bipolar person find a support group in their area. Bipolar marriages can work Fred and Kristin Finn, of Grand Rapids, Mich., describe their marriage as loving and supportive, despite that fact that Kristin was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a teenager. Their teenage daughter has also been diagnosed with the disorder. The pillars of their success, both say, are open communication (Fred is free to reign in Kristin's clothes spending when he thinks she is manic) and predictable schedules. Kristin says carving time out for her own sleep is crucial, as is making time for each other. "We make sure that every Friday night we set aside time for each other,” she says. “Every single Friday night he comes home from work, we turn on some music, we sit, and we talk. My family and friends know—nobody calls us during that time period. Nothing can keep us away from our Friday night, because its our time to connect." For his part, Fred says he would encourage anyone involved with a bipolar patient to educate themselves as much as they can about the disorder. You may not always like what you learn, he warns, but keeping surprises to a minimum makes your relationship easier to navigate. For example, he says, he is worried about the long-term effects of medication on Kristin's health. And while both his daughter and his wife comply with medication and therapy, neither is symptom-free. "No matter what you're doing, there will be symptoms," Fred says. "Once I learned about how the symptoms manifest themselves, once I started reading that and becoming more familiar with that, it gave me a better understanding of how to cope with these things. Getting angry because a person has bipolar disorder won't help anything. Bipolar is treatable, medications and counseling help a great deal, but there's still things about bipolar disorder that I don't think I'll ever figure out." This is a perfectly healthy stance to take, according to Karp. He urges people with bipolar partners to remember what he calls the "four Cs": I can't Control it; I didn't Cause it; I can't Cure it. All I can do is Cope with it. 
 My PMAD (Perinatal Mood & Anxiety Disorder) Gets No Respect! Part One by Dyane Leshin Harwood, Birth of a New Brain July 2, 2015 Postpartum bipolar disorder is often ignored or misunderstood by the postpartum and bipolar communities. It helps to know what postpartum bipolar disorder is, exactly, as different definitions are floating around the world. So here goes  a little bit o explanation  PPBD 101, if you will! My mood disorder postpartum bipolar disorder (PPBD) is also sometimes referred to as postpartum onset bipolar disorder. While Im currently seeking a more recent statistic, in 2008 it was found in the United States that 29 out of 1000 women were affected by postpartum bipolar disorder.* Heres what PPBD is not: PPBD is NOT postpartum depression (PPD or PND) or antenatal (during pregnancy) depression.PPBD is NOT postpartum obsessive compulsive disorder. PPBD is NOT postpartum anxiety, postpartum panic, or postpartum post-traumatic stress disorder/PTSD. PPBD is NOT postpartum psychosis (PPP). Its important to note that postpartum psychosis and postpartum bipolar disorder often manifest together, but postpartum bipolar disorder is NOT always accompanied by postpartum psychosis. To reiterate, the two severe mental illnesses PPP and PPBD are NOT always one and the same! Unfortunately medical professionals, websites, and articles are misinforming the public about the correct definitions of PPP and PPBD. Most of the time PPBD is omitted from lists of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs). This bums me out, especially when these omissions occur on high-traffic websites such Postpartum Progress, which Ill discuss in Part Two as theres an personal twist involved. Heres an example of the kinds of errors I encounter: I created a Google alert for the phrase postpartum bipolar in order to be notified of the latest research. Once in a blue moon Im alerted about women with PPBD profiled in the media, such as this article that popped up last month about an awesome mom named Sarah Hutchison. Sarah Hutchinson is someone who fits the PPBD diagnosis bill, and it turns out I know her from my Facebook days. As cool as Karen Longwells Sarah Hutchison Finds a New Path article is, the piece contains subtle-yet-erroneous information. Sarah was diagnosed with postpartum bipolar disorder in 2008. Longwell states, On Mothers Day, 2010, she was hospitalized and doctors determined she had bipolar disorder, but it was no longer a postpartum illness. Gong! Longwell was off the mark. Once a mother is diagnosed with postpartum bipolar disorder, she has bipolar disorder. The postpartum qualifier simply explains when the bipolar disorder was triggered. A 2013 CTVNews article that got PPBD right was titled Baby Pinks? Postpartum Euphoria Can Be As Dangerous as Baby Blues. It contains an interview with a Toronto-based psychotherapist specializing in postpartum mental health named Maya Hammer. Regarding postpartum hypomania/mania Hammer remarked, In many women, the condition eventually clears up. But for others, its the beginning of a long battle with postpartum bipolar disorder. Long battle is an excellent way to put it. Ive suffered with PPBD since 2007 and until theres a cure, my battle shall continue. I was so glad to find this article, and I wish there were more mainstream articles published with such accurate information. I was faced with a more significant error a few weeks ago. I spoke with a local psychiatrist who told me that he considered postpartum bipolar disorder and postpartum psychosis to be the same. While postpartum psychosis often presents with manic symptoms, which is what makes this confusing, its not always associated with postpartum bipolar. In other words, I had postpartum mania, but I wasnt psychotic. The stack of my hospital records delineating my diagnostic codes backs that up. Make any sense? I know its confusing. Despite my nine years of PPBD research, after the exchange with the physician, I grew paranoid about my knowledge, so I consulted a doctor and nurse who have studied perinatal mood and anxiety disorders in depth. I couldnt believe my luck  within just an hour of my contacting these brilliant, busy women, they emailed me substantive, definitive research material supporting that PPP and PPBD can most definitely be two separate conditions. In the DSM-5 (The Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders  i.e., the "Holy Bible" of psychiatrists) there is a peripartum onset specifier with bipolar disorder (pp. 152-153 DSM 5). I was emailed a scan of the DSM-5 pages so I could see it for myself. There is no mention of psychosis in the section delineating the peripartum onset of bipolar disorder After my friends came to my rescue, I felt confident enough to email the doctor. I havent received a reply yet. The fact that even psychiatrists experts arent clear about what postpartum bipolar disorder entails is a major reason why Im writing my book. Part Two of this blog post will further examine about why any of this really matters. Ill explain the Postpartum Progress conundrum and throw in an ode to my high school English teacher  its all connected. 
 Saying No to Cannabis Improves Bipolar Outcomes by Kenneth Bender, Medscape January 29, 2015 Bipolar patients with mania/mixed episodes who quit using cannabis do better than their counterparts who continue using the drug, new research shows. Investigators at the International Mood Disorders Research Center, Centro de Investigacíón Biomédica en Red en Salud Mental (CIBERSAM), in Spain, found that quitting cannabis during acute treatment for manic/mixed bipolar episodes and refraining from use during a maintenance treatment period significantly improved function and lowered the risk for recurrence. "Our ﬁndings indicate that the negative effects of cannabis use on the course of bipolar disorder disappear when patients stop using it: We found that patients who stopped using cannabis during an acute manic/mixed episode had similar clinical and functional outcomes at 2 years as those who have never used cannabis," the researchers, led by Ana Gonzales-Pinto, MD, PhD, Division of Psychiatry Research, Santiago Apostol Hospital, Vitoria, Spain, write. "Our results also showed that patients who continued to use cannabis had worse outcomes than those who either stopped using cannabis or had never used it," the researchers add. The study was published in the February issue of the Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica. First Long-term Look High rates of use of cannabis and other recreational/illicit drugs in patients with bipolar disorder are well documented. In addition, previous research suggests that cannabis has a deleterious effect on the course of the illness. However, the investigators note that the current study, known as the the European Mania in Bipolar Longitudinal Evaluation of Medication (EMBLEM) study, is "the ﬁrst to explore the long-term consequences of continuation or cessation of cannabis use on remission, recovery, recurrence, and relapse in patients with bipolar disorder." The researchers analyzed the course of bipolar disorder in 1922 patients from various centers in 14 European countries who had either stopped using cannabis during acute treatment of mania or mixed state episode, were not users, or who had continued to use the drug. Patients had progressed from a 12-week acute treatment phase to a maintenance phase extending for 24 months from baseline. Treatments were consistent with usual practice, including antipsychotic and mood stabilizers given singly or in combination and with modifications in regimen and dose as clinical circumstances required. Severity of illness was assessed at each visit with the Clinical Global ImpressionBipolar Disorder Scale and in the acute phase with the Young Mania Rating Scale and the 5-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Functional outcomes were judged from capacity to maintain vocation, relationships, and living situations. Clinical outcomes were reflected in remission, recovery, recurrence, or relapse. Of the 1922 patients, 132 (6.9%) continued cannabis use, 89 (4.6%) stopped use prior to the maintenance phase, and 1701 (88.5%) were not cannabis users. The investigators used logistic regression models to determine association between cannabis use and the clinical and functional outcomes; they controlled for alcohol and other substance use as potential confounding variables. Continuing to use cannabis vs refraining from using the drug throughout the maintenance treatment phase or having no previous use was associated with lower rates of remission and recovery and higher rates of recurrence. When alcohol and other substance use was factored into the analysis, cannabis remained differentiated for reducing time to, and increasing frequency of, symptom recurrence but was not statistically distinct from other substances on the association with lower rates of remission and recovery. In addition, Dr Gonzales-Pinto told Medscape Medical News that "patients that continued using cannabis had more suicide attempts than those that quit or those who never used cannabis." Nine of 130 patients (6.9 %) who continued using cannabis attempted suicide during the maintenance phase, in comparison with 51 of the 1701 nonusers (3.0 %) and 4 of 90 (4.4 %) who had quit using. "In the future, investigations about the benefits of quitting cannabis should be conducted in younger patients, as they use cannabis more frequently," said Dr Gonzales-Pinto. "It would also be of interest to examine the association of cannabis with depressive symptoms and its effect on medication adherence," she added. According to the investigators, the study's ﬁndings "imply that stopping cannabis use is an important goal to achieve in cannabis users with bipolar disorder." Clinical Implications Commenting for Medscape Medical News, Steven Marwaha, PhD, MRCPsych, associate clinical professor of psychiatry, University of Warwick, United Kingdom, who is also the coauthor of a recently published meta-analysis that linked cannabis use to exacerbation of manic symptoms, said the research points to the need for cannabis cessation in patients with bipolar disorder. "The main clinical implication may be that we need to help patients quit cannabis, as their outcomes may then be the same as if they never used," he said. Although characterizing the treatment of comorbid drug use in patients with severe mental illness as "notoriously difficult," Dr Marwaha said that "trials of innovative approaches such as contingency management are under way and may give clinicians critical guidance on helping this group to quit cannabis and thus improve their outcomes." Acta Psychiatr Scand. 2015:131:100-110. Abstract 
 Progress in bipolar disorder -- update from Harvard Review of Psychiatry By Connie Hughes Experts review advances in understanding and treatment of bipolar disorder November 11, 2014 - Several lines of research have opened exciting new frontiers in scientific understanding and clinical management of bipolar disorder. Recent advances in bipolar disease research are described in this month's special issue of Harvard Review of Psychiatry. The journal is published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, a part of Wolters Kluwer Health. Bipolar disease is a "prevalent, complex, and hard-to-treat illness [leading] to extreme and erratic shifts of mood, thinking, and behavior, with a very high risk of suicide as well as increased risks of dying from common medical disorders," write Guest Editors Dost Öngür, MD, PhD, of McLean Hospital, Belmont, Mass., and Ayşegül Yildiz, MD, of Dokuz Eylül University, Izmir, Turkey. The special issue presents concise updates on recent advances in basic science and clinical research into bipolar disorder, contributed by internationally renowned experts in the field. Experts' Perspectives on Recent Advances in Bipolar Disorder The papers grew out of a recent meeting of leading researchers in bipolar disorder in Cappadocia Turkey, sponsored by the Depression & Bipolar Disorder Foundation (DUVAK). The DUVAK is a foundation raised for investigating the frequency and prevention of suicidal acts and deaths associated with psychiatric disorders such as bipolar or manic depressive disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse. Dr Yildiz, the president of the meeting and DUVAK, notes that Cappadocia was selected as the meeting place because bipolar, or manic-depressive, disorder was first described by Aretaeus in Cappadocia nearly 2,000 years ago. The experts who spoke at the conference were asked to contribute brief reports for the special issue, highlighting important new findings in the pathophysiology, neurobiology, and treatment of bipolar disorder. The papers provide accessible updates in critical areas of bipolar disease research, including: The role of white matter disease. Studies have linked the cognitive and emotional difficulties in bipolar disease to "widespread signs of disrupted white matter microstructure." There's evidence that long-term treatment with lithium--a mainstay of treatment for bipolar disorder--counteracts this effect, increasing functional connectivity between key brain areas. Further studies of white matter structure may help to explain the biological underpinnings of bipolar disorder. Stress and HPA axis function. Researchers exploring new approaches to understanding the interrelated effects of stress and genetic factors in patients vulnerable to dipolar disorder. Dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis--which plays a critical role is stress responses--could contribute to the neurocognitive impairment seen in this condition. This line of research could lead to new "testable hypotheses" regarding the development of bipolar disorder. Effectiveness of lithium. About one-third of patients treated for bipolar disease have an excellent response to lithium. Research has identified a wide range of factors associated with lithium responsiveness, including patient, clinical, and, more recently, genetic characteristics. Ongoing studies will provide new insights into the genes and pathways affecting lithium responsiveness. Stimulants for bipolar disorder.There is continued debate over the use of stimulants for depression, especially bipolar depression. Research suggests that some stimulants--particularly modafinil and related drugs--can have augmentative effects to standard treatment for bipolar disorder, including possible reduction in manic behaviors. Functional remediation. Although many interventions have been proven effective in the treatment of bipolar disorder, only a few studies have addressed the issue of functional recovery. A Spanish group reports on a functional remediation program for bipolar disorder, including training in neurocognitive skills for patients to incorporate into their daily routines. This "neuro-cognitive-behavioral" approach shows promise in improving functioning for some groups of patients. Issues in network meta-analysis. Network meta-analysis--a technique enabling indirect comparison of treatment alternatives--is a promising approach to comparing the benefits, risks, and costs of specific treatments. However, some important cautions need to be observed, especially in attempting to compare studies that are not closely similar and in situations where outcomes are typically assessed by rating scales rather than objective biological measures--as is the case in bipolar disorder. "We are pleased to share these brief reports in this most important field with a wider audience," Drs Öngür and Yildiz conclude. Together with the editors of Harvard Review of Psychiatry, they hope the perspectives presented in their special issue will increase awareness and stimulate further research to better understand bipolar disorder and to develop effective treatments for the millions of affected patients worldwide. ### Click here to read the special issue of the Harvard Review of Psychiatry. 
 Former NFL Star Describes Struggle With Bipolar Disorder Robert Glatter, MD - Forbes Contributor Sept 5, 2014 The public is growing increasingly aware of mental illness which now affects one in four people. Raising awareness of this fact has also been the result of many public figures speaking candidly about their ongoing struggles. One former NFL player, Keith O’Neil, who has publicly shared his struggles with bipolar disorder, has been able to raise awareness and provide help to so many who struggle everyday with this mental illness. Characterized by intense mood swings—from depression to mania—bipolar disorder can also lead to severe depression, insomnia, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and self-harm. It is estimated that bipolar disorder affects about 3 percent of the population in the US at some point during life. Both genetic and environmental factors seem to play a role in bipolar illness, with periods of chronic stress as well as childhood abuse potentially being implicated in the pathogenesis of this mental illness. O’Neil speaks candidly about his experiences with bipolar disorder and his ongoing efforts to destigmatize mental illness. Like so many people suffering from bipolar disorder, Mr. O’Neil remembers early symptoms from his childhood, though it took several decades for him to receive a diagnosis. “I was just diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 4 years ago, so I really, in the past year, have gotten healthy. It’s taken me some time,” O’Neil explained. Just as mental illness is often not openly discussed in society, it’s pretty much the same way in the NFL, as O’Neil describes. “Within the locker room and complex it’s not really talked about, so it’s not that different compared with society.” O’Neil did, in fact, seek help while he played for the Colts, and describes how he received support from his his coach, Tony Dungy, during a difficult time in which he struggled to sleep before an important game. Mr. O’Neil retired from the NFL and founded the 4th and Forever Foundation, which raises awareness and funding for mental health research, after winning the Super Bowl with the Indianapolis Colts in 2007. Though Mr. O’Neil had a successful career in football, he struggled with symptoms and often used alcohol to self medicate. He relates a terrible bipolar episode with mania followed by severe depression, after his wife had a miscarriage. He credits his recovery to a memoir Save Me from Myself, by guitarist Brian “Head” Walsh of the heavy metal band Korn, a rediscovery of his faith, and the care of Dr. Steven Dubovsky, Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Buffalo’s School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, an expert in bipolar disorder. “Finding the right medications along with my faith has made all the difference in the world,” says Mr. O’Neil, who is currently writing a memoir about his experience with bipolar disorder. “My mission is to educate people.” O’Neil speaks candidly about his experiences with bipolar disorder and his ongoing efforts to de-stigmatize mental illness. Like so many people suffering from bipolar disorder, Mr. O’Neil remembers early symptoms from his childhood, though it took several decades for him to receive a diagnosis. On Tuesday, September 16th, Mr. O’Neil will discuss his path to living a productive life as the keynote speaker at Discovery to Recovery: A Path to Healthy Minds, the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation’s mental health conference for caregivers, family members, people living with mental illness, and mental health professionals at the Ronald Reagan Building & International Trade Center. “The focus and purpose of the conference is to try to provide information that is useful right now to family members, other loved ones and to the patients themselves, so they can have the best possible way to ensure a productive, happy life,” explained Jeffrey Borenstein, M.D., President and CEO of the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation, which funds cutting-edge research for the understanding, early detection, treatment, prevention and cure of mental illnesses. Legislation to Make Changes to Mental Health Tim Murphy-R, a U.S Representative from Pennsylvania, will also be another keynote speaker who will discuss bipartisan legislation that he has been working on to help families and individuals provide better access to mental health services. As a clinical psychologist for 30 years, Murphy understands firsthand the difficulties that families and individuals face in securing mental health services. And, as the sponsor of legislation that that has the potential to change the way the Federal Government approaches mental health, Murphy realizes that he is on a long and difficult mission. H.R 3717, “Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act,” would help to expand current services by offering alternative approaches to hospitalization, focusing on evidence-based treatments while removing blocks that prevent Medicare and Medicaid from covering specific types of cost effective methods of care. More available outpatient care would be a focus of the Act, along with plans to empower primary care physicians to take a larger role in treating mental illness. And, most importantly, passing the Act would allow parents of adult children with mental illness to communicate with their child’s physician, giving them the opportunity and ability to assist with crucial decisions when their child is in crisis. 
 Understanding the Spectrum of Bipolar Disorder By Cheryl Cranick, NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness Feb. 01, 2017 We do a great disservice to people diagnosed with bipolar disorder by ignoring the condition’s types. Too often I see "bipolar disorder" used alone, yet the illness actually exists on a spectrum. For most of my teenage years, I struggled with sadness, lack of energy, rapid mood cycles and suicidal thoughts without knowing the cause of the symptoms. By age 16, I had been diagnosed with OCD and depression, but treatment wasn’t helping. At age 20, my mother found a home screening test to determine if my depression might actually be bipolar disorder. When the results placed me on the spectrum, I was deeply confused. Based on my understanding of the disorder, its symptoms did not match what I experienced. My dominant symptom was depression, and I never reached mania. After receiving a formal diagnosis from a mental health professional, I began to better understand how I could have bipolar disorder without the "typical" symptoms I had heard so often. My condition is bipolar II disorder—I just didn’t know there was more than one type. This was back in the early 2000s, when talking about mental health was still rather hushed. While, we know more now, and we talk more about mental illness, it still seems the bipolar disorder types are often left out. Why the Details Matter Beyond the occasional reference to Types I and II, bipolar disorder is usually grouped as one condition. Ignoring the spectrum prevents the public from better understanding the complexity of this illness, and what’s worse is the prevalence of misdiagnosis. Studies have found 40% of patients with bipolar disorder were initially diagnosed with unipolar (major depression). This does not surprise me. With bipolar II disorder specifically, depression is usually the most common or stronger symptom of the high/low mood scale, whereas manic symptoms may go unreported to a doctor because the elevated (or increased) mood is not severe enough to affect the person's life. Understanding the Spectrum For those who don't know the difference—or want to easily explain the difference to others—I often hold up my two hands. One hand is unipolar (depression). The other hand is bipolar I (manic depression). What exists in the middle is the bipolar II spectrum. Unfortunately, the spectrum is wide and unique to each person. You can also think of the bipolar spectrum as a hill, with unipolar (depression) at the bottom and bipolar (manic depression) at the top. The space between the upward curve is the spectrum and each person with bipolar II disorder exists somewhere along it. The closer a person’s symptoms are to one end, the more likely that person is to receive a diagnosis of major depression or manic depression. With bipolar I, the mania is usually quite clear. In bipolar II, the mania is "milder." Depression is usually present in both, and may be more severe and prevalent in bipolar II. However, these conditions rarely feature across-the-board symptoms for everyone. It's the cluster of symptoms that need to match up for a diagnosis. I am somewhere in the middle. My lows are low and have reached suicide ideation. My mania, however, is classified as "hypo," and expresses itself in behaviors such as talking faster than normal, staying up late with lots of energy or being quick to anger. Educating Others The spectrum is not new to people who live with the disorder, but it is news to many. As a NAMI In Our Own Voice presenter, two responses I received during presentations last year have stuck with me. After sharing my story at a CIT training, one officer asked me: "How am I able to help people in my community if I don't even know this exists?" Months later, while speaking at a NAMI Family-to-Family class, a woman told me about her husband, noting his depression treatment was not working. Visibly relieved, she said: "I've never heard of this. I think you just diagnosed my husband, daughter and sister-in law." While only a health care professional can diagnose, we must be active self-advocates and educators. We must be clear when referencing this illness in hopes that fewer people will endure the pain and frustration that comes with misdiagnosis. For more information on the bipolar spectrum, check out the book: Why Am I Still Depressed? Recognizing and Managing the Ups and Downs of Bipolar II and Soft Bipolar Disorder by Jim Phelps. Cheryl Cranick fictionalized her bipolar II misdiagnosis and severe weight gain into a novel titled Becoming. The book hopes to educate about bipolar II and encourage empathy, as her character struggles through college. Cheryl lives with her two rescue dogs in Jupiter, FL. 
 Three Bipolar Disorder Symptoms No One Wants to Talk About The three symptoms below represent the side of bipolar disorder we all know is there, but we rarely want to let the public know exists. By Julie A. Fast Jan 29, 2015 I know how important it is to protect the reputation of bipolar disorder in the general public. We dont want people thinking we are dangerous, scary, crazy people who cant be trusted. But I do feel we need to own up to the fact that certain mood swings DO cause the behaviors we want to sweep under the carpet. The three symptoms below represent the side of bipolar disorder we all know is there, but we rarely want to let the public know exists. This is only an opinion of course, but Im truly interested to know if you feel the same. #1 Dangerous, aggressive and violent behavior in bipolar disorder I work with parents and partners of those with bipolar disorder. In the majority of situations, people who are in a strong dysphoric manic episode can be dangerous, aggressive and violent. Physical assault and weapons are not uncommon. Many men go to jail because of this behavior when they actually need psychiatric help. People, both men and women who are mild mannered and kind when well, get super human strength along with the aggression- ripping a sink out of the wall- punching through windows- throwing chairs and other dangerous behavior are not uncommon. Families and partners suffer in silence because they are scared to tell anyone about what really goes on at home. I have violent and HOMMICIDAL thoughts when the dysphoric mania is raging. I used to chase down cars if the driver flipped me off or made a strange face. It is not my goal to scare anyone reading this blog. Its my goal that we are honest about these hidden and pushed under the rug symptoms of bipolar disorder. The solution is management. People with bipolar disorder do not have these symptoms unless the mood swings are raging. Prevent the mood swings and you can prevent the dangerous, aggressive and violent behavior. #2 Psychosis in Bipolar Disorder I have rapid cycling bipolar disorder two with psychotic features. I experienced undiagnosed psychotic symptoms from age 19 to 31 when I was finally diagnosed. Ive had hallucinations and delusions all of my adult life. What scares me is that no one and I mean no one educated me about psychosis when I was diagnosed. It was as if the symptoms didnt exist. When I learned the extent of my psychosis, I was appalled that I had lived with it for so long. My symptoms were mostly visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions. I didnt know that others didnt have them as well! If you have bipolar disorder one, there is a 70% chance of full on psychosis when you are in a full blown manic episode. This psychosis can be very bizarre and mimic schizophrenia. The difference? People with bipolar disorder only have psychosis during a manic or depressed mood swing. There is no psychosis outside of depression or mania. If a person has psychosis in between episodes, this is called schizo affective disorder. Do you or your loved ones have psychosis? If bipolar disorder is involved, psychosis could be involved as well. #3 Cognitive Impairment in Bipolar Disorder Many people find this scary. We already have bipolar disorder, does this mean we have memory problems as well? Maybe. Cognitive impairment from memory lapses, forgetting appointments, being unable to remember information and experiencing brain fog during certain episodes is common! If you have bipolar, youve probably felt the sluggish brain that comes with depression. If you havemania, you have probably tripped over your words, said things you dont mean and had trouble thinking in order. READ Discussion: 3 Topics No One Want To Talk About My cognitive symptoms visit me daily. Im not able to remember dates and numbers and need help with calendars and appointments. Mine got worse after [intense therapy I had for severe depression.] Its something I find distressing, but its easy to manage. I want us to be open about cognitive issues. This is the only way we can get help! Mine tend to linger all of the time, but get worse with mood swings. A perfect example of this- I am supposed to put this blog up by midnight the day of my blog slot. I reminded myself all day yesterday to put it up, but still managed to go to sleep without posting it on time. I have to live with these symptoms and even though a few things slip through, I do control the majority of my minor memory problems with a good support system! Heres the good news- yes, there is good news! Bipolar disorder is an episodic illness. We have all of our symptoms while in a mood swing. This means we are STABLE when we are not in a mood swing. The symptoms I list above usually go away when the illness is successfully managed. It can take regular monitoring for those of us who have daily symptoms. Others who have long breaks between mood swings may even forget the symptoms even existed. This is why we must have a management plan that can recognize the dangerous, aggressive and violent behavior, psychosis and cognitive impairment as soon as it begins. I know we want to protect our reputations around this illness. We dont want to be seen as different or freaks. But I ask that within our community, we get brutally honest about what really happens to those of us with the illness. Its the ONLY way to stop the symptoms and make them stay away forever! Julie 
 Manic Depression by Robert T. Muller, York University December 4, 2016 The song Manic Depression by Jimi Hendrix exposes the frustrating mess of this illness, now known as bipolar disorder. Hendrix himself was never diagnosed as bipolar, but he paints an insightful picture of the hopelessness felt by many who have been. He also mentions that music may have been his salvation, hinting at musics therapeutic value. 
 10 Ways to Prevent Mania and Hypomania by Therese Borchard, World of Psychology July 31, 2016 Bipolar disorder is one of the most difficult illnesses to treat because by addressing the depression part of the illness, you can inadvertently trigger mania or hypomania. Even in Bipolar II, where the hypomania is less destabilizing than the often-psychotic manic episodes of Bipolar I, persons often experience from a debilitating depression that cant be lifted by mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. Antidepressants, though, can cause a person with bipolar to cycle between hypomania and depression. I have worked with psychiatrists who were too afraid of cycling to risk using antidepressants for bipolar patients. They put me strictly on mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. However, I did not get well. I stayed depressed, and all original thoughts in my brain vanished. My current psychiatrist knows that depression is my primary threat, not so much the hypomania, so she was able to pull me out of the depression with the right combination of antidepressants, but is vigilant for any signs of hypomania. Because I know how vulnerable I am to hypomania, I have learned several strategies to help me stay grounded. By making them part of my life, I have been able to take less lithium, my mood stabilizer, which ensures that I continue producing original thoughts and not get too medicated. Here are 10 tools I use to avert hypomania: 1. Practice Good Sleep Hygiene Developing good sleep habits is by far the most potent tool for preventing mania and hypomania. There are a handful of studies documenting that sleep deprivation is associated with mania and hypomania. By going to bed at 10 every night and sleeping a good eight or nine hours, we have the power to stop rapid cycling and to reverse mania or hypomania. In a study published in Biological Psychiatry a rapid-cycling patient was asked to remain on bed rest in the dark for 14 hours each night (gradually reduced to 10 hours). Times of sleeping and waking were recorded with sleep logs, polygraph recordings, and computer-based event recordings. His sleep and mood stabilized when he adhered to a regimen of long nightly periods of enforced bed rest in the dark. The abstracts conclusion: Fostered sleep and stabilizing its timing by scheduling regular nightly periods of enforced bed rest in the dark may help to prevent mania and rapid cycling in bipolar patients. Good sleep hygiene means you go to bed at the same time every night, ideally before 10:30 p.m.  not one night 2 a.m. and another night 7 p.m.; you sleep at least eight hours a night; and you wake at the same time in the morning. Since many folks with bipolar disorder have sleep disorders, a nighttime routine is often needed. For example, I shut down my computer at 8 p.m. and try not to check my emails or messages on my phone. Reading a disconcerting email at 9 p.m. will keep me up all night. It takes me a good two hours to calm down, so I get out the lavender oil around 8:30 p.m., pull out a real book (not an iBook), and begin to tell my body it needs to seriously chill out. 2. Limit Your Screen Time CNN did a story a few years ago on iPads (or LCD screens) and sleep. Journalist John D. Sutter asked Phyllis Zee, MD, a neuroscience professor at Northwestern and director of the schools Center for Sleep & Circadian Biology, if our gadgets can disturb sleep patterns and exacerbate insomnia. Dr. Zee said: Potentially, yes, if youre using [the iPad or a laptop] close to bedtime  that light can be sufficiently stimulating to the brain to make it more awake and delay your ability to sleep. And I think more importantly, it could also be sufficient to affect your circadian rhythm. This is the clock in your brain that determines when you sleep and when you wake up. I absolutely know that to be true because for awhile I was reading iBooks for a half-hour before bed and staying awake until 2 a.m. My concern with LCD screens isnt limited to bedtime. I know from people in my depression community that persons with bipolar disorder have to be careful with LCD screens at all times, as they can make the highly sensitive person hypomanic if the person doesnt take a break from them. For me and for many fragile persons with bipolar, looking into an LCD screen for too long is like keeping your light therapy sunbox on all day. I made the mistake of firing up that baby from 9 p.m. to midnight right after I got it, and I did not sleep one iota the next day, and felt hypomanic all day long. Keep in mind that not only is the light stimulating, but so is all of the messages and tagging and poking  especially if you have as many social media handles as I do. 3. Avoid Certain People and Places Most of us have a few people in our lives that appear as though theyve downed three shots of espresso every time we see them. They are usually great fun and make us laugh. However, the hyperactivity isnt what you need if you havent slept well in a few weeks and are trying to calm down your body and mind. Same goes with places. I dont dare step foot inside the mall, for example, between Halloween and New Years. There is just too much stuff being forced in front of my face. I also hate Toys-R-Us. I still have nightmares about the time my husband pressed three dozen Tickle Me Elmos and the entire shelf began to shake. 4. Pay Attention to Your Body and Breathe Deeply Before attending the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program modeled after the one developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, I did not pay attention to my bodys cues preceding a hypomanic episode. In fact, it was usually another person who would point out the embarrassing truth  like the time my editor wrote a letter to my doctor after I started publishing eight blogs a day thinking my traffic would go up. Now, though, when my heart races and I feel as though I have consumed eight cups of coffee, I know this is my opportunity to reverse my symptoms by doing lots of deep breathing exercises. Of all the automatic functions of the body  cardiovascular, digestive, hormonal, glandular, immune  only the breath can be easily controlled voluntarily, explain Richard P. Brown, MD, and Patricia L. Gerbarg, MD, in their book The Healing Power of the Breath. They write: By voluntarily changing the rate, depth, and pattern of breathing, we can change the messages being sent from the bodys respiratory system to the brain. In this way, breathing techniques provide a portal to the autonomic communication network through which we can, by changing our breathing patterns, send specific messages to the brain using the language of the body, a language the brain understands and to which it responds. Messages from the respiratory system have rapid, powerful effects on major brain centers involved in thought, emotion, and behavior. 5. Eliminate Caffeine A good caffeine rush mimics hypomania. You feel more alive, more alert, like you could actually contribute something of worth to the world. Thats all fine and dandy except when you are teetering on the hypomanic edge. Caffeine can provide the ever-so-subtle push to the other side, especially if you arent sleeping well, which is when most people most crave caffeine. Stephen Cherniske, MS, calls caffeine Americas number one drug in his book Caffeine Blues because of the withdrawal our body goes through three hours after weve drank a cup of coffee or a Diet Coke. Persons with bipolar are even more sensitive to amphetamine-like substances that raise dopamine levels, so the safest way to prevent hypomania is to eliminate the stuff altogether. 6. Exercise My best workouts have been when Im either on the verge of becoming hypomanic or when I am ticked off. My usual 10-minute mile goes down to an eight. I start passing people along my route, at the Naval Academy, feeling like Lynda Carter in her Wonder Woman getup. And my swim interval is consistent with the people who swam across the Chesapeake Bay in under two hours. The truth is I have averted many hypomanic episodes by working out until I collapse or at least become tired, which can take a few hours. Two years ago, the only way I was able to sleep was by swimming more than 300 laps a day. There are people for whom vigorous exercise triggers mania, but most experts report on the benefits of exercise for bipolar disorder. 7. Watch Your Sweets There is a reason why ice cream, Swedish Fish, and animal crackers are comfort food for the bipolar person. The rush of insulin generated by those foods will calm those carbohydrate-craving brain pathways for a bit, until a crash in blood sugar has the person binging again on sweets. Its a vicious cycle, one that can keep a bipolar person cycling indefinitely. I will tell you a true story about sugar and bipolar. About 16 years ago, before I knew I was allergic to sugar and that a high-carb diet was the worst thing I could do for my mental health, I would sometimes drink two bottles of Arizona Iced Tea and eat two or three chocolate-chip oatmeal bars for lunch. One day, there was a Horizon milk truck in front of our house with a large cow on the side. I started mooing at the cow. My new husband, behind me, was truly frightened by this and told me to lay off the Arizona Iced Teas and granola bars for awhile. I havent mooed at a truck since. 8. Be Careful With the Opposite Sex I am all for good, healthy friendships between men and women. If youre not bipolar. Consider me a prude, but I know how difficult it can be to be consistent with good boundaries if you are even the tiniest bit hypomanic. You sincerely didnt mean for something you sent in an email to sound flirtatious  you were just being playful, like you are with your girlfriends. However, when you do get a reaction from a person of the opposite sex, something in the least bit flattering, that communication can ignite a rush that sends a signal throughout your entire body that you want more of the feel-good hormone it just experienced  dopamine, essentially. Its even riskier if you have a history of substance abuse and bipolar because your body will compromise any moral agreements you have signed off on prior to that email in order to get that damn rush again. If youre not careful, this dangerous game will trigger a full blown manic episode. I have had the best intentions with 85-year-old men, and still, somehow, found myself in trouble. So for the time being, Im sticking to female friendships. 9. Use a Shopping List One of the most common manic behaviors is uncontrollable spending or shopping. Therefore, it is sometimes helpful for persons with bipolar disorder to make out a list beforehand of the items you absolutely need to buy  be it a grocery list, a Home Depot run, or a mission to get a your daughters friend a birthday gift. That way you wont end up with 20 different kinds of paint swatches for the kitchen and living room youve decided to paint while you were at the store. 10. Allow Time to Decompress This one is probably the second most important for me to prevent mania. I would say meditate, but that word produces too much expectation and pressure for me right now. Decompressing means after you finish something like a blog post or after youve forced yourself to be social for a few hours at a party that you didnt want to attend, you allow yourselves 15 to 30 minutes to look at the ceiling fan in your bedroom and think about just that: the ceiling fan. The case has been made that persons with bipolar disorder are creative and therefore need more chill time than the average person. Our brains are operating at a faster pace and more intensely than our non-bipolar friends for the periods of time where we must appear normal. So it is absolutely imperative that we allow some time where nothing is required  where we can drool, or lie in the grass, or doodle, or collapse in front of the front door. Although it seems as though these hours are unproductive, this activity will rebuild the gray matter of our brains and safeguard us from a manic episode. 
 
 
 Living with Bipolar by Robert T. Muller, York University July 5, 2016 Student Laura Bain lives with bipolar disorder and describes her condition in this thought-provoking TEDx Talk. She illustrates the turmoil of what life is like for her when the illness makes her feel out of control. 
 A High IQ May Also Have This Mental Cost, Psychologists Find PsyBlog 24 August 2015 Disorders of mood could be the price some people pay for high intelligence, new research finds. Psychologists have found that higher childhood IQ is linked to features of bipolar disorder in young adulthood. The research adds fuel to the debate over the connection between intelligence, creativity and mental health issues. For the research 1,881 people were followed from age 8 until they were 22 or 23-years-old. Their IQ was measured along with any characteristics of mood disorders. The results showed that having ten more IQ points at age 8 was linked to being in the top ten per cent for having manic personality traits in their early twenties. Professor Daniel Smith, one of the studys authors said: A possible link between bipolar disorder and intelligence and creativity has been discussed for many years and many studies have suggested a link. In this large study, we found that better performance on IQ tests at age eight predicted bipolar features in young adulthood. We are not saying that high childhood IQ is a clear-cut risk factor for bipolar disorder but rather that there is likely to be a shared biology between intelligence and bipolar disorder which needs to be understood more fully. Many other factors  including family history of mental illness, childhood adversity, stressful life events and drug misuse  are known to increase an individuals risk of developing bipolar disorder. Our finding has implications for understanding of how liability to bipolar disorder may have been selected through generations. One possibility is that serious disorders of mood such as bipolar disorder are the price that human beings have had to pay for more adaptive traits such as intelligence, creativity and verbal proficiency. This work will inform future genetic studies at the interface of intelligence, creativity and bipolar disorder, and will help with efforts to improve approaches to the earlier detection of bipolar disorder in adolescents and young adults. The study was published in the British Journal of Psychiatry (Smith et al., 2015). 
 Ever-changing moods may be toxic to the brain of bipolar patients Science Daily May 31, 2016 Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe and complex mental illness with a strong genetic component that affects 2% of the world population. The disorder is characterized by episodes of mania and depression that may alternate throughout life and usually first occur in the early 20s. Most recently, physicians have started to group patients as early or late-stage. Early-stage BD patients are classified as those who have had fewer episodes of either mania or depression whereas late-stage patients have had more episodes with more severe effects and are less likely to respond to treatment. This classification between early- and late-stage BD patients has more to do with episode recurrence and severity than the length of time the patient has had the disease. BD diagnosis may be difficult to establish and may take up to 10 years from the first episode. There is no cure for BD but psychotherapy and prescription medication such as antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and benzodiazepines may alleviate symptoms. The brain of bipolar patients shows changes such as reduction in volume and neuroprogression. The latter is a pathological version of an otherwise normal mechanism by which the brain re-writes its neuronal connections, a process that is associated to learning, memory and even recovery from brain damage. In bipolar patients, the process is associated with loss of neuron connections and clinical and neurocognitive deterioration. A previous study has shown that the blood levels of several markers related to inflammation, oxidative stress and neurotrophins (proteins that promote neuron growth and survival) in BD patients are associated to recurrent mood episodes. For instance, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that promotes neuron growth and survival and helps establishing neuron connections, is lower in BD patients, as is the early-growth response 3 (EGR3), a protein associated to helping the brain cope with environmental changes such as stressful stimuli. Besides these alterations, another study has shown that abnormally low levels of chemokines (which are proteins that send signals to other cell components) have also been observed in the blood of BD patients. If these blood markers can be associated to the severity and frequency of mood episodes in BD patients, is it possible that they are also associated to changes observed in the brain of BD patients? To answer this intriguing question, a group led by Fabio Klamt at the Laboratory of Cellular Biochemistry at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), and Flávio Kapczinski at the Laboratory of Molecular Psychiatry at Clinics Hospital of Porto Alegre (HCPA), in Brazil, exposed differentiated neurons to blood serum from either healthy normal individuals or bipolar patients. The group then observed that neurons exposed to serum from bipolar patients had a significant loss in the density of neurites, which is used to estimate the number of neuron connections, if compared to neurite density of neurons exposed to serum from healthy individuals. Interestingly, when serum from early-stage and late-stage BD patients was analyzed separately, no difference in neurite density was observed between neurons exposed to serum from early-stage patients and those exposed to healthy controls' serum. However, a significant difference remained in the neurite density between neurons exposed to serum from late-stage patients and from early-stage patients or healthy controls. The group also found that the number of neurons was not that different between samples, except for those exposed to serum from patients at very late stages of the disease. "Our results indicate that the blood of BD patients is toxic to brain cells and affects the connectivity ability of neurons. Considering our previous knowledge on the association between mood episodes and blood toxicity, we believe that the more episodes a patient has, the more cellular components are produced that impair the brain's ability to deal with environmental changes, inflammation and stress," says Klamt. This is the first study to show the toxic effects of BD serum on human neuronal cells and to present an in vitro study model for a disease for which no animal model has been yet developed. Future studies should focus on finding drugs that can protect BD brain cells from the toxic effects of their own blood.

 Fish Oil for Bipolar Disorder in Children By James Phelps, MD May 12, 2016 The very existence of pre-pubertal bipolar disorder remains somewhat controversial,1-3 although several US research groups consistently identify and study it (eg, at Stanford University4 and at Washington University in St. Louis5). Another such group, at Harvard, has just published an important study of treatment in pre-pubertal and peri-pubertal children with bipolar symptoms. The combination of fish oil and inositol produced, in a small sample, results better than either alone (inositol < fish oil < combination).6 This study is notable for several reasons, independent of the results, which themselves suggest an important alternative to pharmaceutical treatments may be at hand. First, whereas child/adolescent psychiatrists are usually forced to extrapolate to their population from research done in adults, here may be a case of the reverse: these researchers may have found a treatment approach worthy of consideration in adults with bipolar disorder. Second, this work was done in the pediatric psychopharmacology research program at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston, by Joseph Biederman, MD, and colleagues.6 They have been criticized for aggressive diagnosis and treatment of very young children.7 Dr Biederman was sanctioned for links to the pharmaceutical industry.8 But with this study they have addressed these criticisms, at least in part. Indeed, their new work may take some pressure off the need to firmly diagnose bipolar disorder. If a very low-risk alternative exists, treatment can begin without having to wait for the high degree of certainty needed to justify use of medications commonly regarded as first line for bipolar disorder in children, such as risperidone and aripiprazole (per their oft-cited FDA indications: eg, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrys Parents Medication Guide for Bipolar Disorder in Children & Adolescents9[PDF]). The bottom line The bottom line of their small pilot study: fish oil plus inositol was significantly better than fish oil alone, which was superior to inositol alone in most primary outcomes. The sample was small, the dropout rate was nearly 50%, and the children were only moderately symptomatic, so conclusions are limited. However, the results quite strongly suggest that adding inositol to fish oil makes the omega-3s work better. What dosages? In fish oil studies in adults, doses have been quite variable, but an important meta-analysis suggests that there is a threshold for efficacy. Few studies of fish oil for depression found it better than placebo if the dose was less than 1 gram of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) per day andcriticallythe composition was at least 60% EPA (ie, EPA/EPA plus docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]). If anything, the EPA content relative to DHA was more important than its total dose: 2 studies that used lower doses but over 60% EPA had positive results.10 In the new study by Biedermans group, all participants received the same dose of 975 mg of EPA per day regardless of their weight, using a version that was 59.1% EPA. Although there was no placebo arm in this study to determine whether 59% EPA at that dose was actually better than placebo, it was statistically better than inositol, which served as a so-called active comparator in lieu of a placeboan ethical decision in this study population. The dose of inositol was roughly 80 mg/kg, for doses of 1500 to 2000 mg/d. Adverse effects? Because the sample was so small, this is hard to evaluate for certain, but there were no worrisome outcomes related to study medications. Subjects who took fish oil had more gastrointestinal (GI) complaints than those who took inositol alone (5/17 versus 1/7). Note that the dose was not weight-adjusted and was only 25 mg less than the 1 gram of EPA thought necessary for adults; perhaps a slightly lower dose might be sufficient and cause less GI distress. Is the addition of inositol the key to making fish oil really work as a mood stabilizer? Children in this study were 5 to 12 years old. They had been diagnosed with bipolar spectrum disorder (bipolar I or II or not otherwise specified). Diagnoses were established by an experienced clinician whose interview was supplemented with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children: Epidemiologic Version. Exclusions included a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) over 40. Thus, as the authors emphasize, generalizability is limited to children with mild to moderate manic symptoms. In addition to significant reductions in YMRS, this small study also found significant reductions in depression scores and, interestingly, in anxiety scores as well. Perhaps the addition of inositol is the key to making fish oil really work as a mood stabilizer? A larger trial of similar design (same 3 arms of inositol, omega-3, and combination, compared) is recruiting at the Massachusetts General Hospital teams site, due for completion in January 2017 (NCT01396486). Thanks to Dr Biederman and his group for this work on a non-pharmaceutical option for children with mild to moderate symptomsthe child literature leading the way for adult research this time.

 Adults with bipolar disorder at equal risk for anxiety or depression following mania Study suggests re-thinking definition of bipolar disorder to include anxiety Science Daily May 3, 2016 Adults with bipolar disorder are just as likely to develop anxiety as depression following an episode of mania, according to data from a national survey of more than 34,000 adults. This finding, published today in Molecular Psychiatry, may expand our understanding of bipolar disorder to include anxiety. An estimated 5.7 million Americans have bipolar disorder, a serious mental illness that has been characterized by recurrent periods of mania and depression. Because mania, which involves having an elevated or irritable mood, and depression are mood disturbances, bipolar disorder is considered a type of mood disorder. Study participants were interviewed to determine the incidence of manic episodes. A second interview was conducted three years later to determine the subsequent incidence of depression or anxiety. Participants with mania had an approximately equal risk of developing depression (odds ratio of 1.7) or anxiety (odds ratio of 1.8). Both conditions were significantly more common among participants with than without mania. In addition, participants with depression had a significantly higher risk of developing mania (odds ratio of 2.2) or anxiety (odds ratio of 1.7) compared to those without depression. Results of the report align with earlier research demonstrating that depression and anxiety commonly co-occur, and with twin studies indicating that depression and a common form of anxiety known as generalized anxiety disorder behave virtually as the same genetic condition. The new findings extend the close connection between depression and anxiety to individuals with bipolar disorder who have experienced episodes of mania. "Although it has long been widely assumed that bipolar disorder represents repeated episodes of mania and depression as poles along a single continuum of mood, the clinical reality is often far more complex," said Mark Olfson, MD, MPH, professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, research psychiatrist at New York State Psychiatric Institute, and lead author of the report. "The link between mania and anxiety suggests that patients whose main symptom is anxiety should be carefully assessed for a history of mania before starting treatment." A broader clinical definition of bipolar disorder that includes episodes of mania along with anxiety or depression might lead to earlier identification of individuals with bipolar disorder and different approaches to treatment. "For years, we may have missed opportunities to evaluate the effects of treatments for bipolar disorder on anxiety," said Dr. Olfson. "The results of our study suggest that researchers should begin to ask whether, and to what extent, treatments for bipolar disorder relieve anxiety as well as mania and depression."

 Living in a Mixed State By Laura Yeager, World of Psychology April 13, 2016 You thought depression was tough. You thought mania was exhausting. Well, get ready for something really awful  the mixed state. Depression and mania mingle to produce an excruciating, unending, torturous feeling. The mixed state has got to be the worst feature of bipolar illness. You feel both hopeless and electrified at once. Ones body and mind do not know how to process the mixture. One is miserable, and one is also miserable to live with. Youre moving so fast mentally that you have no patience, zero tolerance for anything. If any little thing goes wrong, you fly off the handle and never seem to find your equilibrium again. Since Ive been in this mixed state, Ive developed an awful habit of cussing. Ive been swearing like a sailor. And mean! The mixed state can make you mean. You cant help it. You feel so terrible, so pulled at both ends. You feel like you might snap in half at any minute. I got this way because my psychiatrist took me off my antidepressants. He noticed that I was not depressed anymore, and he decided to do away with the drugs. I went off both Cymbalta and Imipramine. Those little pills had kept me stable. When I was on them, I didnt have a cussing problem. I was calm, happy; I rarely got angry. Going off of them has destabilized me, my psychiatrist says. My body is trying to compensate for their disappearance. My body doesnt know whether its up or down. The positive side is that Im incredibly productive. Ive been writing at least one article a day for the past several weeks. For a writer, this mixed state can be seen as a boon. The energy in the mind seeps out and onto the page. In fact, only when Im writing do I feel normal. I guess this is because Im channeling the excessive good and bad energy into something relatively concrete. Although living with this strange mental state is difficult, the people I feel sorry for are my family members. They never know when Im going to burst into tears or wet my pants from laughing uncontrollably. My son has begun to eye me suspiciously, like he doesnt really know who I am anymore. Thank God they love me. And thank God Ive got some good credit built up with them. All those years I was stable on medication that I (and they) could depend on has made them trust me. Theyre just waiting for the old me to return. The worst part is that my psychiatrist wont do a thing to get me out of this mess. He says hes waiting for me to stabilize, whatever that means. I think it means hes waiting for me to leave this mixed state, for he cant do anything while Im in it. If he gives me antidepressants for the depression Im feeling, hell boost the existing mania. If he gives me anti-mania medication, hell dampen my mood and might make me even more depressed. So I have to just wait this out. I do find a bit of relief from an occasional Lorazepam. I pop one of these at night to help me sleep. Focus on the positive. Focus on the positive. I did get an interesting blog post out of my horrendous condition. Its a bit self-reflexive. A self-reflexive blog post is better than no blog post at all. Right? 
 Touched with Fire: A Film about Bipolar and Artistic Genius By Paul Dalio, PsychCentral.com 26 Jan 2016 My name is Paul Dalio. I’m a filmmaker, husband of my NYU film school classmate, father of two children, and bipolar. Of these labels, the one I’m certain stands out in your mind is bipolar — and not in a good way. That’s no fault of your own, since you probably don’t know much about it, other than what you’ve heard.So how do I deal with this label? What other label do I have to choose from that’s not a disorder, disease, illness, or defect in my humanity? I remember when I received the label at age 24. All every medical book had to offer was that if I stayed on these meds, which made me feel no emotion, I could live a “reasonably normal life.” I didn’t know exactly what that meant, but I was pretty sure it sounded like “just get by.” Six months later, I came across a book, Touched with Fire, by Kay Jamison. It was the first medical text showing a tangible correlation between bipolar and artistic genius, profiling some of the greatest artists in history. For the first time, I heard words, shining right through every medical book’s thick printed clinical ink, describing something I could be proud to be. I was like, “Yeah, that’s what I am. I’m ‘touched with fire.'” It would be destructive for me to deny all four seasons of the bipolar fire. When summer’s mania exceeds its stay and the fall shadows grab hold of your brain, you can feel your will within each withering leaf clinging to the trees of the entire forest surrounding you, slipping as they fall down on you. And then when winter rolls around, your soul retreats deep beneath the frozen ground and it’s calling your body down, it feels like your ashes are fighting gravity. And when spring returns, it extends a warm invitation to rise too high and repeat the bipolar cycle that will lay waste to your lives. Likewise, it would be unwise for a doctor to deny that on those manic summer nights when we look out our hospital windows we can see the stars pulsing spirals of fire across the sky, as God lifts the veil and unfolds the entire universe before our eyes, because we know that humanity’s most beloved image of the sky was seen through a sanitarium window with Van Gogh’s manic eyes. The reason why it would be unwise for a doctor to deny this reality is because if the doctor acknowledged that maybe it wasn’t just some misfiring synapse flashing through a crack in our minds, maybe it was something special — he would also be able to remind the patient that while Van Gogh may have seen that sky through manic eyes, he didn’t paint it while he was manic, because he didn’t need the mania to have the fire. And that doctor would then be able to assure the patient that he or she doesn’t want to stomp out that fire. That over time, with gradual adjustments in medications, the doctor (and patient) would work together to make sure the patient keeps that fire, and sustains it without letting it get out of control and burn down his mind. How much more receptive would a patient be to treatment if the patient was told that the treatment was to nurture a gift, instead of terminating a disease? However, in order for this to work, the doctor has to be able to trust the patient just as much as the patient has to be able to trust the doctor. My doctor trusted me. He saw I was impeccable with my health habits, patient, and I would be satisfied without mania. In return, he was never satisfied until I felt I had full, rich emotion. I now feel deeper, richer emotion and more creativity than I ever did before bipolar — to the point that I can call it a gift, so much that given the opportunity I wouldn’t want a “cure.” Still, I know I’ll always walk a tightrope. But you get better at it over time, and like the guy who crossed between the Twin Towers, you learn not to fall, and the higher the stakes and tighter the wire, the stronger and more disciplined you’re forced to become in order to survive. It’s only when things are so dark you can’t see hope one inch in front of your eyelids and it’s so cold, your soul is numb that you don’t even know if it still exists, when just as your dim glow is this close to being blown out by your own lips, a sudden spark of grit and will to live breaks into a flame of desperation, raging to blaze its way into the light of day again. So by the time you finally rise, the light in all those sunbathing souls combined could not hold a candle to the fire in just one of your eyes. And when you combine that with the bipolar fire, no matter what anyone labels you, that is something they can’t deny. Inspired by his own experience of being bipolar, Paul Dalio wrote, directed, edited and scored Touched with Fire, his feature-film debut starring Katie Holmes and Luke Kirby. Touched with Fire will be released theatrically on February 12, 2016. Learn more at www.touchedwithfire.com. 
 Stop Trying to Stop Enabling Bipolar Behavior By Candida Fink, MD, PsychCentral: Bipolar Beat 5 Nov 2015 Sandra lives with bipolar disorder. I am her psychiatrist or p-doc or shrink (as in Dr. Fink, the shrink). Sandra (not her real name), and I have worked together for many years. At todays appointment, she is moving a little slowly due to some back pain, but she tells me that her mood and energy have remained steady. That is outstanding news, because until a couple of months ago she was experiencing a terrible mood episode that rocked her lifea difficult mixed episode (mania and depression), along with substance use and memory and thinking problems. Her symptoms disrupted relationships with her family and worsened existing financial troubles. But, fortunately, her mood and energy level have not wavered to any clinically significant degree. Today she smiles and tells me about her volunteer work and playing tennis with a friend. Then she stops, and she cries softly and asks me how to help her parents understand what is wrong with her. While the good news is that many people in Sandras life are starting to grasp that bipolar disorder is the problem (and that Sandra is not the problem), her own family of origin shuns and shames her, telling her that they have been advised to stop enabling her bad behavior. They will not let her come to stay with them, and she has been excluded from family events. Sandra is heartbroken. Using the Stop Enabling Advice to Withdraw Love and Compassion I have heard the term enabling countless times in my practicein a range of settings, from spouses of adults with bipolar disorder to parents of children with anxiety and depression. Unfortunately, the term is often misused, as in the situation with Sandras family. The language of enabling comes from the substance use recovery movement and refers to behaviors that directly or indirectly reinforce someones substance use. This approach encourages those who love someone with substance use disorder to allow the natural consequences of the disorder to happen, which theoretically will motivate the person with the disorder to enter into recovery. How well this approach has been studied, or if it is effective, is unclear, but the concept has taken hold in popular culture and has expanded quickly into mental health and child development/parenting. Enabling, the theory goes, is counterproductive to the tough love that is needed for someone to experience and learn from the negative outcomes of their bad behaviors. Unfortunately, those who use this language often extend the definition of enabling to cover emotional support, warmth, and compassion toward someone who is not getting better. Addressing the Misconceptions behind the Stop Enabling Advice I feel as though I tread in delicate territory when I try to re-consider this approachbecause it has been so soundly absorbed into common wisdom and accepted truth, but it is based on some profound misconceptions. So I try to help loved ones recognize the misconceptions that underlie the stop enabling advice by pointing out the following facts: Psychiatric symptoms are not bad behaviors that change based on external motivators. The inactivity of depression, the irritability of anxiety, the impulsivity of mania, to name a few, arent choices that people can change based on the consequences of their behavior. In fact, people who are suffering with psychiatric illness despair over their inability to make change even as things are falling apart around themor when they re-gain their clear thinking they are racked with guilt over damage done.Those struggling with mental illness need ongoing love and care, even when their symptoms make them seem unlovable. Withholding your love or your support causes more despair and guilt, layering onto their mood and behavioral symptoms in ways that are bound to actually make things worse.Mental illness breaks many things in someones life. Sometimes resources for even basic life needs are erodedpersonal finances, occupation, education, nutrition, hygiene, sleep. The idea that just letting someone struggle until they figure it out is profoundly ineffective, not to mention mean-spirited. Things will predictably get worse. But if you are still misattributing your loved ones challenges to their own choices, you will see this as proof that they just dont want to get well. Recognizing the Complexities Of course there are complexities here. People suffering with acute mania, for example, may reject all help and care because the illness prevents them from seeing that they are ill. But getting angry and rejecting them will not make it better. You may have to stop trying to convince them of something that they cannot understand, but expressing your love and support will not enable their mania. You may have to set boundaries for your own health and safety, but that isnt the same as purposely withdrawing yourself, with the idea that it will help your loved one get better. Shutting someone out is not helping. Connection and love are not enabling. While this is not the terms original meaning or intent, it is often misinterpreted and used in dangerous ways, as my patients family had been advised to do. Reconnecting with Loved Ones Sandra and I sort through some of these ideas and try to come up with ways to help her parents and brothers begin to question some of their assumptions about enabling. Sandra feels great relief at the re-building of her life with her wife and kids, but there is a big hole where her own family has stepped out of the picture, thinking that they are doing the right thing. Sandra wipes her tears and heads back out into the world, where her illness remains vastly misunderstood and compassion can be hard to come by.

 How to Care for and Cope With a Bipolar Spouse Health.com If you're involved with someone with bipolar disorder, the romantic relationship may be exciting, exhausting, and stressful. But it will rarely be easy, especially if the object of your affection doesn't comply fully with treatment. Bipolar disorder can be nearly as traumatic for the partners of those with the disorder as it is for the patients themselves. The episodes of depression and mania that bipolar people experience—which can lead to emotional withdrawal, out-of-the-blue accusations and outbursts, spending sprees, and everything in between—have been shown to induce stress, sexual dissatisfaction, and money worries in their partners, as well as depression. Depressive phases, during which the bipolar partner feels hopeless and sad, can drag a healthy partner down, too. "Mental illness is, on some levels, a contagious disease," says David Karp, PhD, a professor of sociology at Boston College who has studied interpersonal dynamics within bipolar couples. "It brings out very strong negative emotions and feelings of isolation in the partner, who struggles so hard to separate the illness from the patient." Relatively few studies have been conducted on the effects of bipolar disorder on relationships, but the research is nearly unanimous that the disorder tends to cause both practical and emotional difficulties for couples. For starters, the ups and downs of bipolar disorder can disrupt the rhythms and routines of a household. In a 2005 survey of people with bipolar partners published in Bipolar Disorders, more than half of the participants reported that their partners illness had reduced their socializing, required them to assume more household responsibilities, forced them to take time off of work, and caused financial strain. The participants also reported that their sex lives sagged when their partner was in a manic or a depressive phase; three-quarters of the women who were interviewed and 53% of the men complained of infrequent sex when their spouses were depressed. Another study of bipolar caregivers found that 86% of the participants characterized the stress they experienced as a result of their partners illness as "major." And 9 out of 10 said they found it difficult to keep the relationship going. Building a team for support Many people enter into relationships with a bipolar person unwittingly, thinking it will be smooth sailing, says Adele Viguera, MD, a psychiatrist at the Cleveland Clinic who works with bipolar couples seeking to start a family. "Maybe they meet the person when the person is hypomanic, not realizing that mood can change," she says. Tim, 37, tried for three years to sustain a relationship with a woman eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder. "She would cycle between extreme happiness and depression," he says, recalling her paranoia, impulsiveness, and self-destructive insecurity. "She broke up with me and started dating other people, and then when I dated other people she tried to win me back." Like many people with bipolar disorder, Tim's girlfriend also struggled with drug and alcohol addiction and got deep into debt—with his credit card. Tim eventually broke down emotionally himself, ended the affair, and tried to forget the experience. "Half of me moved on, but half of me will always love her," he says. Divorce and separation are common in relationships involving bipolar disorder, but according to Dr. Viguera, such relationships don't have to be destructive and separation is hardly inevitable. Both parties have to participate in its success, however. "Taking care of bipolar disorder is a team effort, involving the two people and a psychiatrist or other mental health professional," she says. While she would never speak to a spouse without her patients consent, such open communication empowers both parties to make treatment decisions that lead to a healthier relationship. Mental health professionals aren’t the only ones who can lend a hand. The stigma of mental illness can make couples hesitant to look elsewhere for help, but Karp emphasizes that extended family members and trusted friends can all provide invaluable support. "Spread it around a little bit," he says. "People need support systems. By keeping the illness a secret, people place an additional burden on themselves." Karp also recommends that anyone who cares for someone struggling with bipolar person find a support group in their area. Bipolar marriages can work Fred and Kristin Finn, of Grand Rapids, Mich., describe their marriage as loving and supportive, despite that fact that Kristin was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a teenager. Their teenage daughter has also been diagnosed with the disorder. The pillars of their success, both say, are open communication (Fred is free to reign in Kristin's clothes spending when he thinks she is manic) and predictable schedules. Kristin says carving time out for her own sleep is crucial, as is making time for each other. "We make sure that every Friday night we set aside time for each other,” she says. “Every single Friday night he comes home from work, we turn on some music, we sit, and we talk. My family and friends know—nobody calls us during that time period. Nothing can keep us away from our Friday night, because its our time to connect." For his part, Fred says he would encourage anyone involved with a bipolar patient to educate themselves as much as they can about the disorder. You may not always like what you learn, he warns, but keeping surprises to a minimum makes your relationship easier to navigate. For example, he says, he is worried about the long-term effects of medication on Kristin's health. And while both his daughter and his wife comply with medication and therapy, neither is symptom-free. "No matter what you're doing, there will be symptoms," Fred says. "Once I learned about how the symptoms manifest themselves, once I started reading that and becoming more familiar with that, it gave me a better understanding of how to cope with these things. Getting angry because a person has bipolar disorder won't help anything. Bipolar is treatable, medications and counseling help a great deal, but there's still things about bipolar disorder that I don't think I'll ever figure out." This is a perfectly healthy stance to take, according to Karp. He urges people with bipolar partners to remember what he calls the "four Cs": I can't Control it; I didn't Cause it; I can't Cure it. All I can do is Cope with it. 
 My PMAD (Perinatal Mood & Anxiety Disorder) Gets No Respect! Part One by Dyane Leshin Harwood, Birth of a New Brain July 2, 2015 Postpartum bipolar disorder is often ignored or misunderstood by the postpartum and bipolar communities. It helps to know what postpartum bipolar disorder is, exactly, as different definitions are floating around the world. So here goes  a little bit o explanation  PPBD 101, if you will! My mood disorder postpartum bipolar disorder (PPBD) is also sometimes referred to as postpartum onset bipolar disorder. While Im currently seeking a more recent statistic, in 2008 it was found in the United States that 29 out of 1000 women were affected by postpartum bipolar disorder.* Heres what PPBD is not: PPBD is NOT postpartum depression (PPD or PND) or antenatal (during pregnancy) depression.PPBD is NOT postpartum obsessive compulsive disorder. PPBD is NOT postpartum anxiety, postpartum panic, or postpartum post-traumatic stress disorder/PTSD. PPBD is NOT postpartum psychosis (PPP). Its important to note that postpartum psychosis and postpartum bipolar disorder often manifest together, but postpartum bipolar disorder is NOT always accompanied by postpartum psychosis. To reiterate, the two severe mental illnesses PPP and PPBD are NOT always one and the same! Unfortunately medical professionals, websites, and articles are misinforming the public about the correct definitions of PPP and PPBD. Most of the time PPBD is omitted from lists of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs). This bums me out, especially when these omissions occur on high-traffic websites such Postpartum Progress, which Ill discuss in Part Two as theres an personal twist involved. Heres an example of the kinds of errors I encounter: I created a Google alert for the phrase postpartum bipolar in order to be notified of the latest research. Once in a blue moon Im alerted about women with PPBD profiled in the media, such as this article that popped up last month about an awesome mom named Sarah Hutchison. Sarah Hutchinson is someone who fits the PPBD diagnosis bill, and it turns out I know her from my Facebook days. As cool as Karen Longwells Sarah Hutchison Finds a New Path article is, the piece contains subtle-yet-erroneous information. Sarah was diagnosed with postpartum bipolar disorder in 2008. Longwell states, On Mothers Day, 2010, she was hospitalized and doctors determined she had bipolar disorder, but it was no longer a postpartum illness. Gong! Longwell was off the mark. Once a mother is diagnosed with postpartum bipolar disorder, she has bipolar disorder. The postpartum qualifier simply explains when the bipolar disorder was triggered. A 2013 CTVNews article that got PPBD right was titled Baby Pinks? Postpartum Euphoria Can Be As Dangerous as Baby Blues. It contains an interview with a Toronto-based psychotherapist specializing in postpartum mental health named Maya Hammer. Regarding postpartum hypomania/mania Hammer remarked, In many women, the condition eventually clears up. But for others, its the beginning of a long battle with postpartum bipolar disorder. Long battle is an excellent way to put it. Ive suffered with PPBD since 2007 and until theres a cure, my battle shall continue. I was so glad to find this article, and I wish there were more mainstream articles published with such accurate information. I was faced with a more significant error a few weeks ago. I spoke with a local psychiatrist who told me that he considered postpartum bipolar disorder and postpartum psychosis to be the same. While postpartum psychosis often presents with manic symptoms, which is what makes this confusing, its not always associated with postpartum bipolar. In other words, I had postpartum mania, but I wasnt psychotic. The stack of my hospital records delineating my diagnostic codes backs that up. Make any sense? I know its confusing. Despite my nine years of PPBD research, after the exchange with the physician, I grew paranoid about my knowledge, so I consulted a doctor and nurse who have studied perinatal mood and anxiety disorders in depth. I couldnt believe my luck  within just an hour of my contacting these brilliant, busy women, they emailed me substantive, definitive research material supporting that PPP and PPBD can most definitely be two separate conditions. In the DSM-5 (The Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders  i.e., the "Holy Bible" of psychiatrists) there is a peripartum onset specifier with bipolar disorder (pp. 152-153 DSM 5). I was emailed a scan of the DSM-5 pages so I could see it for myself. There is no mention of psychosis in the section delineating the peripartum onset of bipolar disorder After my friends came to my rescue, I felt confident enough to email the doctor. I havent received a reply yet. The fact that even psychiatrists experts arent clear about what postpartum bipolar disorder entails is a major reason why Im writing my book. Part Two of this blog post will further examine about why any of this really matters. Ill explain the Postpartum Progress conundrum and throw in an ode to my high school English teacher  its all connected. 
 Saying No to Cannabis Improves Bipolar Outcomes by Kenneth Bender, Medscape January 29, 2015 Bipolar patients with mania/mixed episodes who quit using cannabis do better than their counterparts who continue using the drug, new research shows. Investigators at the International Mood Disorders Research Center, Centro de Investigacíón Biomédica en Red en Salud Mental (CIBERSAM), in Spain, found that quitting cannabis during acute treatment for manic/mixed bipolar episodes and refraining from use during a maintenance treatment period significantly improved function and lowered the risk for recurrence. "Our ﬁndings indicate that the negative effects of cannabis use on the course of bipolar disorder disappear when patients stop using it: We found that patients who stopped using cannabis during an acute manic/mixed episode had similar clinical and functional outcomes at 2 years as those who have never used cannabis," the researchers, led by Ana Gonzales-Pinto, MD, PhD, Division of Psychiatry Research, Santiago Apostol Hospital, Vitoria, Spain, write. "Our results also showed that patients who continued to use cannabis had worse outcomes than those who either stopped using cannabis or had never used it," the researchers add. The study was published in the February issue of the Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica. First Long-term Look High rates of use of cannabis and other recreational/illicit drugs in patients with bipolar disorder are well documented. In addition, previous research suggests that cannabis has a deleterious effect on the course of the illness. However, the investigators note that the current study, known as the the European Mania in Bipolar Longitudinal Evaluation of Medication (EMBLEM) study, is "the ﬁrst to explore the long-term consequences of continuation or cessation of cannabis use on remission, recovery, recurrence, and relapse in patients with bipolar disorder." The researchers analyzed the course of bipolar disorder in 1922 patients from various centers in 14 European countries who had either stopped using cannabis during acute treatment of mania or mixed state episode, were not users, or who had continued to use the drug. Patients had progressed from a 12-week acute treatment phase to a maintenance phase extending for 24 months from baseline. Treatments were consistent with usual practice, including antipsychotic and mood stabilizers given singly or in combination and with modifications in regimen and dose as clinical circumstances required. Severity of illness was assessed at each visit with the Clinical Global ImpressionBipolar Disorder Scale and in the acute phase with the Young Mania Rating Scale and the 5-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Functional outcomes were judged from capacity to maintain vocation, relationships, and living situations. Clinical outcomes were reflected in remission, recovery, recurrence, or relapse. Of the 1922 patients, 132 (6.9%) continued cannabis use, 89 (4.6%) stopped use prior to the maintenance phase, and 1701 (88.5%) were not cannabis users. The investigators used logistic regression models to determine association between cannabis use and the clinical and functional outcomes; they controlled for alcohol and other substance use as potential confounding variables. Continuing to use cannabis vs refraining from using the drug throughout the maintenance treatment phase or having no previous use was associated with lower rates of remission and recovery and higher rates of recurrence. When alcohol and other substance use was factored into the analysis, cannabis remained differentiated for reducing time to, and increasing frequency of, symptom recurrence but was not statistically distinct from other substances on the association with lower rates of remission and recovery. In addition, Dr Gonzales-Pinto told Medscape Medical News that "patients that continued using cannabis had more suicide attempts than those that quit or those who never used cannabis." Nine of 130 patients (6.9 %) who continued using cannabis attempted suicide during the maintenance phase, in comparison with 51 of the 1701 nonusers (3.0 %) and 4 of 90 (4.4 %) who had quit using. "In the future, investigations about the benefits of quitting cannabis should be conducted in younger patients, as they use cannabis more frequently," said Dr Gonzales-Pinto. "It would also be of interest to examine the association of cannabis with depressive symptoms and its effect on medication adherence," she added. According to the investigators, the study's ﬁndings "imply that stopping cannabis use is an important goal to achieve in cannabis users with bipolar disorder." Clinical Implications Commenting for Medscape Medical News, Steven Marwaha, PhD, MRCPsych, associate clinical professor of psychiatry, University of Warwick, United Kingdom, who is also the coauthor of a recently published meta-analysis that linked cannabis use to exacerbation of manic symptoms, said the research points to the need for cannabis cessation in patients with bipolar disorder. "The main clinical implication may be that we need to help patients quit cannabis, as their outcomes may then be the same as if they never used," he said. Although characterizing the treatment of comorbid drug use in patients with severe mental illness as "notoriously difficult," Dr Marwaha said that "trials of innovative approaches such as contingency management are under way and may give clinicians critical guidance on helping this group to quit cannabis and thus improve their outcomes."

 Progress in bipolar disorder -- update from Harvard Review of Psychiatry By Connie Hughes Experts review advances in understanding and treatment of bipolar disorder November 11, 2014 - Several lines of research have opened exciting new frontiers in scientific understanding and clinical management of bipolar disorder. Recent advances in bipolar disease research are described in this month's special issue of Harvard Review of Psychiatry. The journal is published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, a part of Wolters Kluwer Health. Bipolar disease is a "prevalent, complex, and hard-to-treat illness [leading] to extreme and erratic shifts of mood, thinking, and behavior, with a very high risk of suicide as well as increased risks of dying from common medical disorders," write Guest Editors Dost Öngür, MD, PhD, of McLean Hospital, Belmont, Mass., and Ayşegül Yildiz, MD, of Dokuz Eylül University, Izmir, Turkey. The special issue presents concise updates on recent advances in basic science and clinical research into bipolar disorder, contributed by internationally renowned experts in the field. Experts' Perspectives on Recent Advances in Bipolar Disorder The papers grew out of a recent meeting of leading researchers in bipolar disorder in Cappadocia Turkey, sponsored by the Depression & Bipolar Disorder Foundation (DUVAK). The DUVAK is a foundation raised for investigating the frequency and prevention of suicidal acts and deaths associated with psychiatric disorders such as bipolar or manic depressive disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse. Dr Yildiz, the president of the meeting and DUVAK, notes that Cappadocia was selected as the meeting place because bipolar, or manic-depressive, disorder was first described by Aretaeus in Cappadocia nearly 2,000 years ago. The experts who spoke at the conference were asked to contribute brief reports for the special issue, highlighting important new findings in the pathophysiology, neurobiology, and treatment of bipolar disorder. The papers provide accessible updates in critical areas of bipolar disease research, including: The role of white matter disease. Studies have linked the cognitive and emotional difficulties in bipolar disease to "widespread signs of disrupted white matter microstructure." There's evidence that long-term treatment with lithium--a mainstay of treatment for bipolar disorder--counteracts this effect, increasing functional connectivity between key brain areas. Further studies of white matter structure may help to explain the biological underpinnings of bipolar disorder. Stress and HPA axis function. Researchers exploring new approaches to understanding the interrelated effects of stress and genetic factors in patients vulnerable to dipolar disorder. Dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis--which plays a critical role is stress responses--could contribute to the neurocognitive impairment seen in this condition. This line of research could lead to new "testable hypotheses" regarding the development of bipolar disorder. Effectiveness of lithium. About one-third of patients treated for bipolar disease have an excellent response to lithium. Research has identified a wide range of factors associated with lithium responsiveness, including patient, clinical, and, more recently, genetic characteristics. Ongoing studies will provide new insights into the genes and pathways affecting lithium responsiveness. Stimulants for bipolar disorder.There is continued debate over the use of stimulants for depression, especially bipolar depression. Research suggests that some stimulants--particularly modafinil and related drugs--can have augmentative effects to standard treatment for bipolar disorder, including possible reduction in manic behaviors. Functional remediation. Although many interventions have been proven effective in the treatment of bipolar disorder, only a few studies have addressed the issue of functional recovery. A Spanish group reports on a functional remediation program for bipolar disorder, including training in neurocognitive skills for patients to incorporate into their daily routines. This "neuro-cognitive-behavioral" approach shows promise in improving functioning for some groups of patients. Issues in network meta-analysis. Network meta-analysis--a technique enabling indirect comparison of treatment alternatives--is a promising approach to comparing the benefits, risks, and costs of specific treatments. However, some important cautions need to be observed, especially in attempting to compare studies that are not closely similar and in situations where outcomes are typically assessed by rating scales rather than objective biological measures--as is the case in bipolar disorder. "We are pleased to share these brief reports in this most important field with a wider audience," Drs Öngür and Yildiz conclude. Together with the editors of Harvard Review of Psychiatry, they hope the perspectives presented in their special issue will increase awareness and stimulate further research to better understand bipolar disorder and to develop effective treatments for the millions of affected patients worldwide. ### Click here to read the special issue of the Harvard Review of Psychiatry. 
 Former NFL Star Describes Struggle With Bipolar Disorder Robert Glatter, MD - Forbes Contributor Sept 5, 2014 The public is growing increasingly aware of mental illness which now affects one in four people. Raising awareness of this fact has also been the result of many public figures speaking candidly about their ongoing struggles. One former NFL player, Keith O’Neil, who has publicly shared his struggles with bipolar disorder, has been able to raise awareness and provide help to so many who struggle everyday with this mental illness. Characterized by intense mood swings—from depression to mania—bipolar disorder can also lead to severe depression, insomnia, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and self-harm. It is estimated that bipolar disorder affects about 3 percent of the population in the US at some point during life. Both genetic and environmental factors seem to play a role in bipolar illness, with periods of chronic stress as well as childhood abuse potentially being implicated in the pathogenesis of this mental illness. O’Neil speaks candidly about his experiences with bipolar disorder and his ongoing efforts to destigmatize mental illness. Like so many people suffering from bipolar disorder, Mr. O’Neil remembers early symptoms from his childhood, though it took several decades for him to receive a diagnosis. “I was just diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 4 years ago, so I really, in the past year, have gotten healthy. It’s taken me some time,” O’Neil explained. Just as mental illness is often not openly discussed in society, it’s pretty much the same way in the NFL, as O’Neil describes. “Within the locker room and complex it’s not really talked about, so it’s not that different compared with society.” O’Neil did, in fact, seek help while he played for the Colts, and describes how he received support from his his coach, Tony Dungy, during a difficult time in which he struggled to sleep before an important game. Mr. O’Neil retired from the NFL and founded the 4th and Forever Foundation, which raises awareness and funding for mental health research, after winning the Super Bowl with the Indianapolis Colts in 2007. Though Mr. O’Neil had a successful career in football, he struggled with symptoms and often used alcohol to self medicate. He relates a terrible bipolar episode with mania followed by severe depression, after his wife had a miscarriage. He credits his recovery to a memoir Save Me from Myself, by guitarist Brian “Head” Walsh of the heavy metal band Korn, a rediscovery of his faith, and the care of Dr. Steven Dubovsky, Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Buffalo’s School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, an expert in bipolar disorder. “Finding the right medications along with my faith has made all the difference in the world,” says Mr. O’Neil, who is currently writing a memoir about his experience with bipolar disorder. “My mission is to educate people.” O’Neil speaks candidly about his experiences with bipolar disorder and his ongoing efforts to de-stigmatize mental illness. Like so many people suffering from bipolar disorder, Mr. O’Neil remembers early symptoms from his childhood, though it took several decades for him to receive a diagnosis. On Tuesday, September 16th, Mr. O’Neil will discuss his path to living a productive life as the keynote speaker at Discovery to Recovery: A Path to Healthy Minds, the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation’s mental health conference for caregivers, family members, people living with mental illness, and mental health professionals at the Ronald Reagan Building & International Trade Center. “The focus and purpose of the conference is to try to provide information that is useful right now to family members, other loved ones and to the patients themselves, so they can have the best possible way to ensure a productive, happy life,” explained Jeffrey Borenstein, M.D., President and CEO of the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation, which funds cutting-edge research for the understanding, early detection, treatment, prevention and cure of mental illnesses. Legislation to Make Changes to Mental Health Tim Murphy-R, a U.S Representative from Pennsylvania, will also be another keynote speaker who will discuss bipartisan legislation that he has been working on to help families and individuals provide better access to mental health services. As a clinical psychologist for 30 years, Murphy understands firsthand the difficulties that families and individuals face in securing mental health services. And, as the sponsor of legislation that that has the potential to change the way the Federal Government approaches mental health, Murphy realizes that he is on a long and difficult mission. H.R 3717, “Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act,” would help to expand current services by offering alternative approaches to hospitalization, focusing on evidence-based treatments while removing blocks that prevent Medicare and Medicaid from covering specific types of cost effective methods of care. More available outpatient care would be a focus of the Act, along with plans to empower primary care physicians to take a larger role in treating mental illness. And, most importantly, passing the Act would allow parents of adult children with mental illness to communicate with their child’s physician, giving them the opportunity and ability to assist with crucial decisions when their child is in crisis. 
 Is it too much to expect that as long as I take my medication I should be able to live a normal life? I am struggling right now. I just got back from holidays. I was really hypomanic and now I've crashed. I feel like I am constantly fighting to manage my moods and it takes so much out of me. When I'm able to coast I wait for the crash. I'm grouchy and irritable and just so tired. I just want a normal life. Or something that resembles one. 
 Attentional biases toward emotion help characterize bipolar disorder By Lucy Piper, Medwire News 24 January 2014 Psychiatry Res 2014; Advance online publication Attentional biases toward emotional images are a key feature of bipolar disorder and may contribute to increased vulnerability and continued maintenance of the condition, researchers report. They found that 66 patients with bipolar disorder had a general bias toward threatening stimuli, regardless of mood state, relative to 20 mentally healthy individuals, and an “anhedonic bias” to positive stimuli when depressed. Each participant simultaneously viewed four pictures depicting happy, neutral, sad, or threatening emotions for 20 seconds. Eye-tracking technology showed that the 23 euthymic patients spent 24% of the time looking at threatening images, the 23 manic patients 25% of the time, and the 20 depressed patients 26% of the time, compared with 18% of the time for the mentally healthy controls. “[T]he attentional preference toward threatening stimuli would increase the [bipolar disorder] patients’ emotional reactivity and would contribute to the onset or exacerbation of an affective episode,” says the team, led by Ana García-Blanco (Universitat de València, Spain). “This bias toward threatening information is in accordance with accounts that emphasize the influence of these pathogenic attentional biases on reactivity to stressful events for [bipolar disorder] patients, even in asymptomatic patients and high-risk relatives,” they add. The bipolar patients with depression also differed significantly from controls in terms of the time spent looking at happy images, at just 27% of the time compared with 38%, respectively. The two groups did not differ significantly with regard to the percentage of time looking at sad images, however, leading the researchers to suggest that the emotional bias was due to a lack of motivation to focus attention on positive images, rather than a higher attention to sad images. “[T]he avoidance of positive stimuli in the depressive state may disturb emotional self-regulation and may be an important maintenance factor for [bipolar disorder],” the researchers write in Psychiatry Research. Therefore, training of biases toward mood-relevant information “may constitute a novel treatment for symptomatic [bipolar disorder] episodes,” they suggest. The team also comments that if bias toward threatening images is confirmed as a vulnerability marker for bipolar disorder, it will be important to investigate whether potential preventive strategies can be used particularly in high-risk individuals.

 Smartphone app for bipolar patients Bill Steele July 4, 2013 A smartphone app to assist people with bipolar disorder, conceived by Cornell researchers, has won the prestigious $100,000 Heritage Open mHealth Challenge. The app for iPhone and Android phones, called "MoodRhythm," was developed by a team led by Tanzeem Choudhury, associate professor of computing and information science, and postdoctoral fellow Mark Matthews. It uses a phone's microphone, light sensors and accelerometer to monitor sleep and social patterns and combines this information with what the patient reports about daily activities, food routines and mood to learn what situations have positive or negative outcomes. The app gives the patient helpful advice to maintain a regular daily rhythm, while gathering vital information for the patient's doctor. Bipolar disorder, also called manic depression, affects some 5.7 million American adults in a given year and is characterized by extreme mood swings from a happy, hyperactive state to extreme depression. It is associated with poor functional and clinical outcomes, high suicide rates and huge societal costs. "Rhythms guide our lives," Choudhury explained. "Our biological clocks tell us when we need to sleep, eat and wake. When these rhythms are interrupted or obstructed, it can be difficult for our bodies to get what they need to stay healthy and balanced." The app can replace traditional paper diaries that patients often find difficult to maintain. It was designed in collaboration with patients and clinicians, and is based on Choudhury's earlier experiments with using smartphones sensors to detect social interactions, stress and sleep. To protect privacy, the phone does not listen in on the content of speech, but notes variations in pitch, volume, speaking rate and other characteristics to measure emotional states. "It is one of the greatest challenges in health care to develop cutting-edge technology that not only meets clinical needs but that can be incorporated with ease into patients' lives," Choudhury said. Co-sponsored by Heritage Provider Network, Open mHealth and the University of California, Los Angeles, the Open mHealth Challenge was created to catalyze the development of mobile applications that promote mental and physical health. Choudhury directs the People-Aware Computing group at Cornell, which develops systems that can reason about human activities, interactions and social networks in everyday environments. The group creates mobile apps to monitor physical and mental health, and is experimenting with the idea of exploiting the ubiquity of smartphones to gather public health data from large populations. Open mHealth was co-founded by Ida Sim, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and Deborah Estrin, professor of computer science at the Cornell NYC Tech campus, to create a universal language for mobile mental health software, enabling all applications in the field to work together. Choudhury's team is contributing both a novel method to detect sleep and a sensing module to identify levels of social interaction to the Open mHealth software library. 
 The Biggest Lesson Ive Learned in Managing My Bipolar Disorder by Margarita Tartakovsky, M.S. December 11, 2013 When Andy Behrman was diagnosed with bipolar disorder over 20 years ago, he didnt know anyone who had the illness. He didnt even know what it was. I remember asking the doctor if I needed to have an MRI and if I would live to see my next birthday. For about 10 years he struggled with stabilizing his disorder, which included being misdiagnosed by seven mental health practitioners, taking over 40 medications and receiving ECT. Its a period he chronicles in his book Electroboy: A Memoir of Mania. One of the biggest lessons hes learned in managing his bipolar disorder and living a successful life is to embrace the illness. Ive chosen to be friends with my bipolar disorder instead of [viewing it as] the enemy. I feel [that] too much emphasis is placed on fighting mental illness and recovery, when I know today that learning to embrace my bipolar disorder and keeping the focus on coping and managing to live with it on a daily basis would have been a much better strategy. Bipolar disorder is a difficult and complex illness. It affects all areas of a persons life and often requires meticulous management. Of course, everyone is different. Every story is different, said Ellen Forney, a graphic novelist and author of the New York Times bestseller Marbles: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo, and Me. Still, it can help to know how others with the same illness have coped. Below, individuals with bipolar disorder share what theyve learned in managing their illness. Understanding Severity The biggest lesson Ive learned is to take bipolar disorder very seriously, said Julie A. Fast, a bestselling author of books on bipolar disorder and professional coach who works with loved ones of people with the illness. Fast was diagnosed with rapid cycling bipolar disorder II in 1995. Its not like other illnesses. Its sneaky and dangerous if you dont watch it all of the time. She compared it to type I diabetes. People with diabetes one cant mess around  ever. I cant either. Fast follows her treatment plan and practices self-care. And despite the challenges, she describes herself as an eternal optimist. As long as I can keep relatively stable, I always find a way to get on with life and strive for happiness. I will never stop. Having a Great Support System Ive learned the most important thing in managing my bipolar disorder is my support system, said Elaina J. Martin, whos written a memoir about living with mental illness and pens the Psych Central blog Being Beautifully Bipolar. This includes her psychiatrist, therapist, mom, best friends and boyfriend. I recently found a great new psychiatrist who takes time to explain things to me and we decide together on changes to my medication. I have a therapist that I trust and together we come up with solutions to things that are troubling me. She can call her loved ones at any time, day or night, if she needs them. My boyfriend is my live-in supporter. Her support system also helps her recognize when she might be experiencing a depressive or manic episode. Martin also has learned that some people simply wont stick around. Its been a hard lesson, but its also been important to let them go. You deserve to surround yourself with people who support you and care about your wellness. Kevin Hines, author of the critically acclaimed memoir Cracked, Not Broken: Surviving and Thriving After a Suicide Attempt, has developed a vast support system of family and friends. I call them my personal protectors. They stay close in my life so that when I cannot be self-aware with my accepted mental illness they can catch me when I inevitably fall. Committing to a Treatment Plan The biggest lessons Ive learned in managing my illness is that I need to commit to my treatment plan and take care of myself to stay well for my family, said Jennifer Marshall, who writes the blog BipolarMomLife.com, which explores what its like to open up about living with mental illness. It was a realization she made after her last hospitalization. Marshall was hospitalized twice in the beginning of her illness and two more times during the years she had her kids. All four times were because I was unmedicated. Once I came to the realization that bipolar disorder is an illness Ill live with for the rest of my life, I pledged my dedication to my treatment plan. In addition to medication, her plan includes getting enough sleep, exercise and regular visits with her psychiatrist and therapist. Martin also has accepted that she needs to take medication to manage her illness. I am neither ashamed nor embarrassed by that need. For her sleep is paramount, as well. Lack of sleep can fling me into mania so I am sure to get at least eight hours a night, usually more. Forney has come up with small ways to make treatment more tolerable. She keeps her medication clearly labeled in a Peanuts lunchbox. After getting her blood drawn (she takes lithium), she treats herself to a fancy tea drink. Its a tiny treat that makes her happy. Being Honest The biggest lessons Ive learned in managing my bipolar disorder is to be honest with myself and my psychiatrist, said Laura SQ, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2002 and proudly lives a stable life in Houston, Texas, with her family. Without honesty, and without self-awareness I truly cant maintain my stability. Hines, also a Global Mental Health & Suicide Prevention Speaker, has bipolar I with psychotic features. For him being completely honest about his symptoms, especially the distorted, psychotic beliefs, is a key part of recovery. When I have paranoid delusions and hallucinations, I am able to voice them to those closest to me, and thus they are able to squash those mind distortions with their true reality. Being Kind to Yourself I also know, and have learned, I cannot be too hard on myself. We must give ourselves the room needed to grow with love, understanding and patience, SQ said. Even though being self-compassionate might not be easy (or natural), Forney reminds herself that self-flagellation is useless. She likened her self-berating to a parent yelling at a child whos having a tantrum. Rather than calming them down, the parent just keeps yelling, and the child keeps getting upset. Taking A Holistic Approach In my personal experience with bipolar disorder, I learned that in addition to my medications and counseling guidance, I needed to incorporate a holistic approach to my self-care, said Gail Van Kanegan, DNP, RN, a nurse practitioner at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. She practices yoga, tai chi and meridian energy exercises, which have improved her sleep, boosted her energy and enhanced her self-confidence. Having A Routine For veteran journalist and Psych Central managing editor Candy Czernicki, the biggest lesson has been the importance of following a strict schedule. Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy is valuable for helping people with bipolar disorder create and adhere to daily routines. The Power of Stability When Forney was diagnosed she feared that treating her bipolar disorder would kill her creativity. She associated creativity with the electrifying passion of mania. Today, with treatment, she feels just as passionate about her work, just in a more grounded way. She compared it to falling in love. At first couples have a highly charged, head-over-heels attraction. Over the years, this develops into a deeper and calmer way of being passionate with each other, she said. Stability is good for my creativity. For Behrman, now a mental health advocate and speaker, overcoming the most difficult challenges of his life has given him perspective and made him a better person. Because I have successfully navigated myself through this devastating experience, which on several occasions could easily have taken my life, every challenge in front of me seems so much easier today. Today, his coping skills are finely tuned, and hes become a more strategic thinker, a better father and more empathetic friend. Hines views his illness as one of lifes greatest gifts. Had I not developed it and gone through such pain, I would not be the man I am today. I would not have been given the opportunity to share my life with so many others. My voice has been and will continue to be heard. His story continues to inspire people all over the world and change lives for the better. Stability is a growing and learning process every day, SQ said. She encouraged readers to never give up. I wont say it will be easy. I will say, it will be worth it. 
 
 When Someone You Love is Bipolar by Therese Borchard November 5, 2013 when someone you love is bipolar.jpg The following interview with Dr. Cynthia Last and her husband, authors of When Someone You Love Is Bipolar is reprinted with permission of Guilford Press. 1. Dr. Last, in your book you candidly admit that although you were originally diagnosed with bipolar disorder in your early 30s, you didnt accept it until 10 years later. Why is denial so pervasive among bipolar sufferers? How can spouses convince their loved ones to get the help they need? One reason that denial is so common is because being diagnosed as bipolar is extremely scary! Many people have preconceived notions about the disorder that stem from how it has been portrayed in the media, where the most severely ill cases often are used as illustrations. No one wants to be labeled with a condition that looks crazy. But what we now know is that bipolar illness really is a spectrum of disorders, including manifestations of the illness that are much milder than the characterizations weve seen in movies and on television (I am fortunate to have one of the milder versions of the disorder, although during the rough times in battling the illness I didnt typically feel fortunate.) One way partners can help get their loved ones to break through their wall of denial is by doing what I refer to as the family tree exercise. Since bipolar disorder tends to run in families, acknowledging the presence of the illness in relatives often serves as a wake up call for the person who has had trouble accepting the truth. 2. Bipolar disorder brings up tough questions about day-to-day living, such as should we travel for the holidays? And can we still enjoy wine with dinner? How can couples work together to address these issues? Most experts in this area believe that sticking to a regular routine or schedule and abstaining from alcohol are essential components to achieving mood stability. This can make travel and even moderate drinking difficult. However, every person is different and its important for couples to make decisions based on their specific experiences. Even if it appears that a bipolar person can have an alcoholic beverage from time to time without any seemingly negative consequences, alcohol is completely out of the question during a mood episode (either depression or mania). Alcohol worsens and lengthens mood episodes; even worse, it also dramatically increases the risk of suicide, which is disproportionately high among people with bipolar disorder (at one time or another, about 25% of bipolar individuals make an attempt on their own lives). Spouses can play a huge role in supporting their partners sobriety by abstaining from alcohol themselves. 3. What are some common early warning signs of depression? Of mania? In the early stages of a mood episode, what can spouses do to help prevent the spell from escalating? There are many possible early warning signs for depression, including, fatigue, change in appetite, and a general lack of enthusiasm. Early signs of mania may be irritability, excessive spending, and accelerated speech. Warning signs vary from person to person. Whats important is for spouses to know their partners own idiosyncratic early warning signs so they can be alert for them and share their observations with their partners. Once recognized, couples may be able to nip the problem in the bud by using the early intervention plans for depression and mania outlined in my book. 4. While bipolar disorder is a profoundly challenging and painful mental illness, Dr. Last, you do believe it has some benefits. What are some of the positive effects of being bipolar? Much has been written about the relationship between creativity and bipolar illness. Historically it has been documented that an inordinately high percentage of writers, artists, and musicians have had the disorder. Some characteristics of manic and hypomanic statessuch as increased drive and productivity, the ability to take risks, and a heightened sense of self-confidencemay help the creative process. Some bipolar people worry that medication will stifle their creative energy, but in my professional experience, while this is true for some, many find just the oppositetheir work is even better once their mood has been stabilized. 5. Nobody likes taking medication. Often, bipolar sufferers stop taking their pills because they feel they dont need them anymore, or because they cant stand the side effects. How can spouses help their partners stick with their treatment program? Medication is essential to bipolar healththere is absolutely no way around this. Unfortunately, lack of medication compliance is a common problem among bipolar people, so it often becomes a bone of contention between partners. When partners maintain that they dont need medication anymore, spouses can draw their mates attention to specific, problematic events that occurred when their loved ones were taking medication holidays. If an unpleasant side effect is to blame for the medication discontinuationlike weight gain, which is a complaint I hear frequentlyspouses can help their mates by together taking on lifestyle changes that can lessen the problem (in this case, embarking on an exercise program or a healthier eating style together as a couple). 6. Following a set routine has been shown to increase mood stability. What are some easy lifestyle changes couples can make that will have a lasting, helpful impact? Having regular meal and sleep-wake times are very important. However, the ability to fall asleep at a regular, reasonable hour often is difficult for bipolar people. Avoiding stimulating activitiessuch as exercising, watching a scary movie, or working on a mentally taxing projectjust before bedtime is essential. Instead, suggest that your partner wind down with a hot bath, relaxing music, or a cup of chamomile tea. 7. Supporting a bipolar partner is hard work. How can spouses take care of themselves? What are some good coping strategies? First and foremost, its crucial that spouses take time for their own needs (and not feel guilty about doing so!). If they dont, they often become so consumed with their partners illness that they lose themselves. Devoting time to individual hobbies and interests allows well-needed breaks and prevents physical and emotional depletion. I also recommend that stressed spouses consider joining one of the many support groups that exist for people who have bipolar partners to get the help and support they need. 8. Mental illness is a very personal matter. What should couples grappling with bipolar disorder tell their friends and family? What, if anything, should they tell their employers? Deciding what to tell friends and relatives depends on a number of factors, including how close your partner is to the person, whether the person is someone you and your mate feel you can trust, and determining if there is any advantage to letting the person know. In some cases, it may be sufficient to simply say, ____ hasnt been feeling well. However, if the friend or relative is already aware that your spouse has bipolar disorder, it may be easiest to say that your partner has had a recurrence of the illness. The situation can get much stickier when it comes to an employerafter all, this is the individual who signs your partners paychecks. If your mate is having a mood episode and is unable to work see if it is possible for him or her to use vacation time. But if there is no vacation time available or it cant be taken on short notice, a medical leave may need to be considered. In this case the employer will probably become aware that your spouses illness is psychiatric in nature since it likely will be your partners psychiatrist who documents the reason for the leave. 9. Barry, in the books foreword, you wrote that you firmly believe Dr. Lasts illness has made you much closer and stronger than other couples. Can you give some examples? Cynthia and I are very appreciative of our relationship and, therefore, we virtually never take each other for granted. We also work hard to support each others individual personal and professional goals. Although bipolar disorder is a fact of our life together, it doesnt define our lives or our relationship. My wife and I firmly believe that other bipolar couples can achieve this as well. 10. Surviving the aftermath of a mood episode presents its own challenges. What are some things couples can do to preserve trust, rebuild intimacy, and move forward together? Seeing your partner beginning to stabilize after an episode of mania or depression is an enormous relief. Still, mood episodes can have serious repercussions (financial, legal, social, to name just a few) that linger long after they are over. Couples need to find ways to deal with the emotions they are feeling so they can put the past behind them. Support groups and therapy can be useful in this process. Also, instituting measures designed to prevent similar, adverse circumstances from occurring again can help create a greater sense of security going forward. 
 Ellen Forney: a graphic memoir of bipolar disorder John Grace September 1, 2013 For years cartoonist Ellen Forney struggled to find effective treatment for her condition. Now she has created Marbles: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo & Me, a deeply personal hand-drawn book that details her experiences Shortly before her 30th birthday, Ellen Forney was diagnosed with manic depression. Her pattern was fairly normal. "Throughout my 20s I had moderately extended periods of a more or less good mood and moderately extended periods of more or less down moods that became increasingly distinct from one another," she says. "But I didn't really progress to a state that could be considered an episode or a disorder until I was about 28." It took Forney over a year to admit she had a problem and get help. It took four years for her to find the right cocktail of medication to keep her mood swings in check. That was more than 10 years ago. Now Forney, an illustrator and cartoonist from Seattle, has published a graphic memoir of her mental illness. Her book, Marbles: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo & Me, is an unflinching and frequently unforgiving narrative of what it means to have bipolar disorder and how treatment can often seem more terrifying than the illness itself. Though, as Forney admits: "By definition I was mentally ill, so perhaps I wasn't always the most rational of judges." Forney had the idea for the book for some time, but held off writing and drawing until she was sure that she could cope with the consequences. "Like most people with a mental illness, I'm only too aware of the fragility of my emotional state," she says. "Even when I'm feeling OK, I have a nagging sense I might be on borrowed time. That something might change. So I didn't want to start work on something so sensitive and personal until I'd had some time to trust my recovery. I needed to believe that revisiting the most acute phases of my illness wouldn't be too traumatic, and also that I could cope with the reception  good or bad  of writing about it. When you go public and talk about something openly, you have no control over how people may react." Fortunately, the response in the US, where her book was first published, has been overwhelmingly positive. The combination of words and drawings turned out to be a powerful medium for exploring manic depression, with cartoons representing the emotional extremes which words seldom seem to do justice to. "The depressions were certainly more painful for me to experience and for friends and loved ones to witness," Forney says. "But, curiously, looking back, the manic episodes now feel rather more dangerous. "The euphoric parts were amazing. Colours felt vivid and vibrant; the world felt fascinating and interconnected  and I felt powerful, sexy, and full of love and curiosity. But I was also insatiable, impatient, compulsive and restless. I cringe now at how offputting to other people I might have been." For Forney's friends and family, the depressive episodes were the easiest to cope with. She never at any time felt suicidal, nor did she exhibit any such tendencies. "I don't take any real credit for this," she says. "It wasn't some great show of inner strength. I just think I was lucky. Suicide never felt like a serious option; when I was depressed, my main focus was just on trying to get well." Finding the right medication to stabilise her moods was a long and frustrating period. Over four years, Forney's psychiatrist, Karen, who features as one of the key characters in Marbles, tried her patient on different doses of various drugs, including lithium, clonazepam and lamotrigine; some had little or no effect, some had unpleasant side-effects, such as bringing her out in acne or lowering her blood count. Others were just too expensive in the US, where there is no NHS or standardised prescription charge. Eventually the right dosage of lithium was found. So, did Forney ever wonder if the medicines were making any real difference to her condition? "Of course," she says. "I think every patient with a mental illness wonders that at some point. But stopping a drug regime that appeared to be working, even if it was only coincidentally, was not a chance that I felt I could afford to take. The possibility of relapsing into manic depressive mood swings was unbearable. Still, for Forney, facing up to the fact that she needed to remain on medication was not easy. "I was worried that my creativity would be lost," she says. "That the price of having my bipolarity under control would in some way make me not me. I still held on to the romantic notion of the artist as some kind of mad genius." Forney also attempted to disguise another significant aspect of her life from her psychiatrist. "I lied to Karen for several years about how much dope I was smoking," she says. "I told her I was only getting stoned a couple of times a week, when it was actually more like five days a week. "Eventually, I figured there might be some connection between my dope smoking and the severity of my mood swings. So I confessed and decided to quit taking drugs. I wouldn't say that everyone with manic depression needs to stop smoking dope, but it has worked for me. I don't feel any less creative than I was before. And if I am, there's more than enough compensation in being stable and productive." Marbles: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo and Me by Ellen Forney 
 Bipolar Disorder's Nasty Secret: Exposing the Elusive Mixed State by Terri Cheney, Psychology Today June 30, 2011 Most people think that bipolar disorder consists strictly of manic and depressive episodes. That's like saying the rainbow consists only of red and blue. In fact, there's a whole range of moods on the bipolar spectrum. The one I seem to be all too familiar with these days is the most difficult one to describe: the dreaded "mixed state." It's not quite depression, not quite mania, but a nasty combination of the two. Trying to explain how a mixed state feels is like trying to snatch hold of a tornado. It's impossible  the damned thing never stops long enough to be captured. But I'll try. Last Wednesday, I woke up knowing that something was wrong. It was a gorgeous day, the kind Southern California is famous for. Too gorgeous: the birds outside my window harped on my nerves, the abundant sunshine made me squint. The telephone rang and I snapped "What is it?" instead of "Hello?" I got rid of the caller as quickly as possible and fixed myself a cup of coffee. But the mug was too hot and it singed my fingers. Cursing, I threw it in the sink, where it broke into a hundred shards. It was my favorite mug, not just because of its cheery yellow flowers but because it was the last remaining evidence of a weekend tryst with a long-lost boyfriend. There would never be another mug like that, or another man like him, or another love affair worth remembering. I was too old for such silly souvenirs; my life was as good as over. I started to cry. Carelessly, my eyesight blurred by tears, I tried to sweep up the shards in the sink; but they cut me and blood began to flow. I couldn't do anything right, I thought, so I picked up another piece of the mug and deliberately sliced my naked ring finger. More blood  another thin red rivulet, merging with the first and coursing down the drain. How quickly here and forgotten, like me. All that afternoon, I continued to swirl between emotions, not a single good one in the bunch. Hopelessness, fear, self-loathing, despair  all the classic notes of depression were there, but they were overlaid with the least desirable aspects of mania. No euphoria, no elation, none of that sky-high, soaring giddiness that makes a manic mood worthwhile. Just rage and irritability and a relentless, pulsing energy that seized hold of my body and urged me to move, move, move. But move where? Move why? My mind insisted that there was no destination. I kept thinking about my old boyfriend, and that last weekend we had spent away, so in love, so eager to be together. Then, too, it had dawned a beautiful day, but I'd woken up snappish, on edge for no reason. I didn't know then about the mixed state. All I really knew for sure was that I was a dangerous, destructive force, and the world would be wise to get out of my way. My boyfriend tried all the wrong approaches. First, he tried to nuzzle me, but I was too prickly to be touched. Then he tried logic: it was a beautiful day, we were together, there was nothing to be upset about. Big mistake. I was still a litigator back then, and I out-argued him with ease. He got furious, as men frequently will when you best them. But his anger was no match for me. I could feel those words gathering in my throat  you know those words that you absolutely have to keep suppressed at all times? Every relationship has them. There are certain things you just can't say, certain weaknesses you're just not allowed to exploit, unless you're willing to suffer the consequences. I didn't care. I spewed them at him, vile words that I won't even repeat because I wish them to vanish forever. He was gone before I could taste my tears. Mixed states are all about shattering things  mugs, relationships, best intentions. I know that now, and it makes me careful. When I wake up as I did last Wednesday, squarely in the tornado's path, I don't go out. I limit my interactions with people, whenever possible. I call my doctor and increase my meds. I know that the mixed state is stronger than I am, but that doesn't mean that it owns me, body and soul. I may cut a finger; I may break some glass. But I refuse to be swept away. 
 Risk of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relatives of people with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Henrik Larsson, et al. BJP August 2013 203:103-106; published ahead of print May 23, 2013, See editorial, pp. 81-83, this issue. Abstract Background Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and it has been suggested that combined bipolar disorder and ADHD is aetiologically distinct from the pure disorders. Aims To clarify whether ADHD shares genetic and environmental factors with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Method By linking longitudinal Swedish national registers, we identified 61 187 persons with ADHD (the proband group) and their first- and second-degree relatives, and matched them with a control group of people without ADHD and their corresponding relatives. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine the risks of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in the relatives of the two groups. Results First-degree relatives of the ADHD proband group were at increased risk of both bipolar disorder (odds ratio (OR) = 1.84-2.54 for parents, offspring and full siblings) and schizophrenia (OR = 1.71-2.22 for parents, offspring and full siblings). The risks of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia among second-degree relatives were substantially lower than among full siblings. Conclusions These findings suggest that the co-occurrence of ADHD and bipolar disorder as well as ADHD and schizophrenia is due to shared genetic factors, rather than representing completely aetiologically distinct subsyndromes. 
 Making a Hard Choice for a Soft Landing By TANA WOJCZUK, in The New York Times May 17, 2013 In the romantic comedy Silver Linings Playbook, Pat emerges from a mental institution and finds new love with a dark-haired loose cannon named Tiffany. Pat is bipolar, a condition that reveals itself mainly in manic episodes of aggressive optimism. He runs for miles a day in a trash bag vest to make himself sweat more, fixates on his ex-wife and keeps score of his lifes silver linings. Masked by the candy-coated plot is a bittersweet message for those of us who have fought against taking medication for our mental illnesses. Some might believe that Pat gets the girl when he wins a bet for his father by scoring a mediocre 5 with an admittedly adorable dance number. But the real turning point is Pats decision to begin taking his medication. Once he does, in a brief scene in his mothers kitchen, Pat becomes less obsessed with counting silver linings, less overstimulated and more able to feel. As Tiffany continues to self-destruct, its newly medicated Pat who is clearheaded enough, despite his sense that the meds make him dull, to see that their friendship has become something much deeper. I discovered I was bipolar right around the time I found the love of my life. I met Xander while still on the off-ramp of a miserably failed relationship, a broken engagement that was, while not tragic, the icing on the cake. By this point I had begun introducing myself to future boyfriends as a serial monogamist (they always thought I was joking). Like clockwork, I would go from passionate love and early moving-truck syndrome to screaming and crying fights right around the 2 1/2-year mark. For me, it wasnt the 7-year itch but the 3-year panic. The relationship would come to a crashing end when I would enter the suspicion phase (not just jealousy but suspicion that the person Id hitched my wagon to was trying to undermine me at every turn). Granted, there were a few actual lemons. But after more than a decade of having my relationships expire on my personal sell by date, I knew, in the same way you know it if a bad smell keeps following you around, that the cause of my unhappiness was me. Its difficult to describe what it feels like to be inside a manic episode. Depression has been more thoroughly described in literature than mania, maybe because to write about mania is to become manic. When I try to describe it, I feel it, and this feeling is indistinguishable from the onset of an actual manic episode. First the wind starts, howling so loudly I cant hear myself think, and the dust kicks up so I can only see the person in front of me  whether thats someone I love or a stranger in a bar. Then I catch fire. It starts in my stomach and I begin to feel as if Im the only person in the world who knows what real feeling is. Other people, people I once felt connected to, start to seem like characters in a movie Im trying and failing to direct. The more disconnected I feel, the more urgently I need to prove to myself that Im alive. I stay up all hours, invincible to sleep. I exercise, pig out on junk food, and look for sex as a way to escape the paranoia thats come in and colonized every odd glance and weak smile, and to feel like Im a real person inside a real body again. When I met Xander, I had started seeing a therapist for the first time, and fairly quickly she sent me to a psychiatrist. The therapist and I both suspected bipolar disorder, but although I would keep seeing her, she argued that, because bipolar disorder is now understood to have a biological cause, sufferers dont usually find relief in therapy alone. The psychiatrist confirmed our suspicions and prescribed a low dose of lithium, which would, as he described it, protect me from overloading my circuit board. This sounded promising, but still I waited for a week before I started taking the pills. Meanwhile, the prescription got crumpled in my wallet as I resisted, not so much out of fear of side effects, which seemed mild compared with the blindness and death that could occur with newer medications, but because taking them meant I would change. Despite the diagnosis, I wouldnt think of myself as mentally ill until I began taking pills for my condition. Then, I imagined, I would change  I would be the one on medication. During this same week I had several amazing dates with Xander, a 20-something man who, like me, was a writer and teaching writing as a graduate student at Columbia. These dates were epic: 13-hour days filled with talking, walking across Central Park to the Metropolitan Museum, going to the roof for the spectacular view of the park, and watching turtles in the pond near the Delacorte Theater. It was love for sure, and a rare intellectual and spiritual connection that just enhanced the physical one. One Sunday morning we decided to grab some coffee and croissants and have our breakfast in Central Park. We headed for the turtle pond, which had already started to feel like our spot, and when we got there we found that the grass had been taken up with picnic blankets, strollers and games of kiddie football. Lets climb up there, Xander said, pointing to a solitary live oak whose sturdy lower branches spread out just five feet off the ground. Great, I said. But Im not much of a tree climber. Growing up, boys had often challenged me to do things I didnt want to do: climbing high fences or racing on a gravel road. Fearful, I was always the one who hurt myself. You can do it, Xander said, holding his hands out, fingers interlaced. The branch will hold. Live oaks grew wild in the Florida panhandle where he had grown up; their gently curving branches were used to build early American battleships. I put my hand on his shoulder, and he didnt javelin me in the air or push me into the tree. He just held steady and let me climb on him to get to where I wanted to be. Then he handed my coffee up to me. Im 30, I thought, and I just climbed my first tree. Rather than tease me for not being able to do it, or doing it for me, Xander helped me do it myself. Looking down at the kids roughhousing on the grass, I also imagined he would be an amazing father. It was after one of these dates that I finally made the decision. If I had to change  and it was clear that something had to give  I wanted to become someone who could love and be loved, for the long haul. And maybe, I thought, I could define my new identity this way, as someone who was open to love or not, rather than as someone who was or was not on medication. My therapists arguments also crept into my head: Bipolar disorder is biological, and I wouldnt tell a diabetic to quit taking insulin, would I? It was harder for me to admit that my mind was sick than if I had developed an illness whose causes were easier to define. Easier to heal my body, I thought, than to medicate my mind. A few weeks after starting lithium, the effect was astonishing. For the first time in my life, I felt as if I was part of a world that could and did go on without me, a humbling feeling but also a vast relief. This also meant that I could see Xander as a person rather than as a mere appendage of my own weird world. It was frustrating at first: I wasnt used to being so aware of someone elses feelings, and a lifetime of feeling out of control meant I had developed some bad habits. I am still impatient, still quick to anger. But now Im also quick to apologize and more able to separate big problems from small annoyances. Although it has been a year and a half since Xander and I married, and three years since I started taking lithium, I still have a lot of growing to do when it comes to love. In many ways, I feel as if Im starting over, learning how to love from that first kiss. I continue to rebel against taking medication, and threaten to go off, or do go off and feel that familiar panic creeping up on me again. I still wonder whether Im taking some easy way out and question whether thats good or bad. But I couldnt really feel love until I wasnt constantly overwhelmed with sensation. The truth is, I couldnt do it alone. I became who I am with a little help, but what makes it easier is remembering the reason I believed I could change. It was love. Love was the drug.

 The Problem With How We Treat Bipolar Disorder By LINDA LOGAN, New York Times April 26, 2013 The last time I saw my old self, I was 27 years old and living in Boston. I was doing well in graduate school, had a tight circle of friends and was a prolific creative writer. Married to my high-school sweetheart, I had just had my first child. Back then, my best times were twirling my baby girl under the gloaming sky on a Florida beach and flopping on the bed with my husband  feet propped against the wall  and talking. The future seemed wide open. I dont think there is a particular point at which I can say I became depressed. My illness was insidious, gradual and inexorable. I had a preview of depression in high school, when I spent a couple of years wearing all black, rimming my eyes in kohl and sliding against the walls in the hallways, hoping that no one would notice me. But back then I didnt think it was a very serious problem. The hormonal chaos of having three children in five years, the pressure of working on a Ph.D. dissertation and a genetic predisposition for a mood disorder took me to a place of darkness I hadnt experienced before. Of course, I didnt recognize that right away. Denial is a gauze; willful denial, an opiate. Everyone seemed in league with my delusion. I was just overwhelmed, my family would say. I should get more help with the kids, put off my Ph.D. When I told other young mothers about my bone-wearying fatigue, they rolled their eyes knowingly and mumbled, Right. But what they didnt realize was that I could scarcely push the stroller to the park, barely summon the breath to ask the store clerk, Where are the Pampers? I went from doctor to doctor, looking for the cause. Lab tests for anemia, low blood sugar and hypothyroidism were all negative. Any joy I derived from my children was now conjoined with grief. I couldnt breathe the perfume of their freshly shampooed hair without being seized by the realization that they would not always be under my roof. While stroking their backs, I would mentally fast-forward their lives  noses elongating, tongues sharpening  until I came to their leave-taking, until I reached my death and, ultimately, theirs. I lost my sense of competence. If a colleague remarked on my intelligence, I mentally derided him as being too stupid to know how dumb I was. If someone asked what I did for a living, I would say, Nothing  a remarkably effective conversation stopper. I couldnt bear the thought of socializing; one night I jumped out of the car as my husband and I were driving to a party. Despite having these feelings in my mid-30s, when my kids were 8, 5 and 3, I was thriving professionally: I had recently completed my Ph.D. in geography, had just finished co-teaching a semester at M.I.T. as a lecturer and was revising my dissertation on spec for a respected university press. Yet several nights a week, I drove to the reservoir near my home, sat under a tree and, as joggers and their dogs ran past, thought about ending it all. There was a gun shop on the way to my poetry group; I knew exactly where to go when the time came. My day, once broken by naps, gradually turned into lengthy stretches of sleep, punctuated by moments of wakefulness. My husband and I didnt explain to the kids that I was depressed. Mommys a little tired today, we would say. A year or so earlier, a therapist told us to tell the children. But theyre just kids, we said. What do they know? They know, she said. When we eventually spoke to them, my oldest daughter came to me and asked: Why did you keep it a secret? I thought all mothers were like you. After a few weeks of stopping at the reservoir, as suicide eclipsed all other thoughts, I finally told my husband about my worsening psychic pain. The next day I was hospitalized. It was June 1989. Even though we were living in Boston, we decided I should go to Chicago to work with the psychopharmacologist who, 15 years earlier, restored the health of my father, who had also been hospitalized for depression. As the cab pulled away from our house, I turned and saw three childrens hands pressed against the screen of an upstairs window. This is the way the world breaks. The moment the psych-unit doors locked behind me, I was stripped of my identity as wife, mother, teacher and writer and transformed into patient, room number and diagnosis. I couldnt open a refrigerator without permission. If I were on suicide watch, I had to ask before going to the bathroom. I was told when to sleep and when to wake, when to eat and when to go to group. My routine, which at home had cleaved so closely to my childrens, now revolved around the clattering sounds of the food trays being brought three times each day from the service elevators into our unit. With my husband and children nearly 1,000 miles away, I was severed from my fixed stars. I missed my childrens smells, the way they used to wrap their bodies around my legs when I was on the phone. I brought my sons comforter to the hospital for my bed. I remembered him with one leg thrown across the covers, a small foot peeking out from his pajamas. When my children visited, I had to resuscitate my maternal self, if only for an hour. I dragged myself to the shower, pulled on a pair of clean sweat pants and a fresh T-shirt and ran a streak of lipstick across my lips, hoping to look like a reasonable facsimile of a mother. My doctor used my first hospitalization as a so-called washout, a period during which he planned to take me off the medication I was on and introduce several drugs in several different combinations. The prospect of polypharmacy  taking many drugs at once  seemed foreboding. I read about Prozacs giving some people entirely new personalities: happier, lighter, even buoyant. Who are you going to turn me into? I asked my doctor. Im not turning you into anyone, he said. Youll be yourself, only happier. I dont think I even have a self anymore. Well find your self. I was wary. Just dont turn me into Sandy Duncan. How much insult to the self is done by the symptoms of the disorder and how much by the drugs used to treat it? Paradoxically, psychotropic drugs can induce anxiety, nervousness, impaired judgment, mania, hypomania, hallucinations, feelings of depersonalization, psychosis and suicidal thoughts, while being used to treat the same symptoms. Before getting to the hospital, my daily moods ranged from bad to worse, each state accompanied by a profound depth of feeling. The first drug I was given was amitriptyline (Elavil), which, in the process of reducing my despair, blunted all my other emotions. I no longer felt anything. It was like going from satellite TV to one lousy channel. While some medications affected my mood, others  especially mood stabilizers  turned my formerly agile mind into mush, leaving me so stupefied that if my brain could have drooled, it would have. Word retrieval was difficult and slow. It was as if the door to whatever part of the brain that housed creativity had locked. Clarity of thought, memory and concentration had all left me. I was slowly fading away. I would try to talk to my doctors about my vanishing self, but they didnt have much to say on the subject. Instead they focused on whether I could make eye contact or how much expression I showed in my face. They monitored my lithium and cortisol levels; they took an M.R.I. of my head. I received an EKG, was exposed to full-spectrum lighting and kept awake all night for sleep-deprivation therapy. Nurses jotted down their observations; my scribbled lines in art therapy were inspected. Everything was scrutinized  except the transformation of my self and my experience of its loss. My current psychiatrist, William Scheftner at Rush University Medical Center, says this is typical when treating patients with acute mental disorders. The primary goal at the height of a mental-health crisis is symptom reduction. That means monitoring patients sleep patterns, appetites and responses to medications  not worrying about philosophical questions like who they are and who they will become. The issue of self just isnt there, he told me, because youre so preoccupied with whether someone is actually improving or not. By August 1989, I was back in Boston with my husband and kids, having been discharged from the hospital almost three months after I was admitted. My children, like many people, mistook discharge for recovery. Why did they let you out if youre not better? my daughter asked. I didnt know how to explain the welter of factors that go into discharge: poses no threat to self or others; is functioning at a high-enough level to participate  however minimally  in the tasks of daily living. Recovery was not an end, I told her, but a process. The trees were starting to change colors. Acorns dropped and exploded like tiny bombs. My car was in the driveway; my clothes were in my closet. But things felt ill fitting and unfamiliar. Whose kids are these? I wondered. And when is their mother coming to pick them up? Nowhere was my otherness more keenly experienced than at the driveway at the grammar school. Everyone knew that I had been away, and why. I tried to imitate the other mothers, their relaxed camaraderie, their confidence, the way they threw their heads back when they laughed. Around Halloween, as our neighbors made wild-eyed pumpkins with crooked teeth, my children noticed that there were frightening things in our house, too. I had my first hypomanic episode. This was how my doctors confirmed that my depression wasnt just depression  I had bipolar II disorder, like my father. With bipolar II, unlike bipolar I, the upward swing from depression stops at hypomania, not mania. Mania is having five grand pianos delivered to your house; trying to buy the Sears company; sleeping with the local baseball team. Hypomania is mania with a tether, and, while it might avert some of the financial and interpersonal disasters that unchecked mania may engender, it can still feel like a runaway train. By that point my vestigial self had grown used to my depressed self, with her somber mood and tenuous hold on life. Now a newcomer arrived. I seemed to have split into three: my shellshocked self, my depressed self and a brazen hypomanic self. We could practically hear the new girl sizing us up, cackling. Under her reign, we slept two hours a night. We ate half a sandwich and two potato chips a day. We packed the childrens lunchboxes at 3 a.m. We began to study for the MCATs (the fact that we had never taken a biology or chem class seemed irrelevant). We telephoned long-lost friends. The hypomanic selfs activities, from relentless lunch dates and impulsive spending sprees, left my tattered and depressed selves saying, Thats not us and We dont do that. I no longer went to bed with my husband. Instead I stayed awake, scribbling in my notebooks. My wakefulness worried my son. I had a bad dream, he said. You were downstairs working in the middle of the night. And while everyone else in the house was sleeping, the whole house fell down on you. Oh, I said, pulling him close. That is a bad dream. Did anybody get hurt? No, but the cats almost died. Every few weeks, I needed to buy smaller clothes. Whats happening to you, Mommy? my daughter asked. Youre shrinking. Hypomania was consuming me. My doctor, in an effort to quash the hypomania, upped my lithium dose and catapulted me back into depression, back to Chicago, back to a locked psych unit, after New Years Day in 1990. A few weeks later, my kids came to visit. I met them in the lobby. The chair I was sitting in felt insubstantial; the walls seemed to bend. My son was excited. I made a scientific discovery! he said. There cant be a shadow in the darkness. He understood depression better than my doctors, I thought. Mommy? he said a few moments later. He sounded miles away. I leaned back and fell asleep. I didnt see them again for four months. My medical records show that by the spring, I thought I was in a Canadian train station and that it was 1976. I lugged a suitcase stuffed with towels around the unit, looking for the departure platform. If my self had been assailed by depression, then psychosis was the final blow. My sense of boundedness  where I stopped and other people or the environment began  was sloppy, like a toddler scribbling outside the lines. I didnt envision myself as human; I pictured myself as black vermicelli on an asphalt driveway. For a brief time, I could neither write nor speak. My journals show a perseverating pencil  a long string of Ts or entries in hypergraphic writing, alternating between conventional and unconventional language: They will have a stronstrazzly negative reaction to them. I need held . . . In stortingitoat  plus, the idea of [X] a new set of residential pleomorph  exoskeleton weitropstite jejoined to be betters. blep. I hallucinated. The world was suddenly up for grabs; reality, an option. Rectangular rainbows streamed through the day-room windows. Nonexistent organ music pealed through the neighborhood on a Sunday morning. Peasants from a Jean-François Millet poster walked out of the frame and marched across the wall. Some researchers say that in psychosis, the self persists, however tenuously. Sue Estroff, a professor of social medicine at the University of North Carolina, described it as more of a foreground, background thing. During psychosis, the self recedes. But, she told me, youre still in there. I dont think so. If I had been allowed outside, I would have doubted the reality of my shadow. By early summer, the psychosis had run its course, and I returned to lucidity. The kids came to visit. They dragged me off the sofa and onto the carpet. We were laughing and crying simultaneously. I felt the surge of something primal. Later that summer, after I became well enough to be discharged once again, we decided to move to the Chicago area so that I could continue working with my fathers doctor, whom I trusted, and be near our families. But seven months after moving into our new house, I was back in the hospital. I would be readmitted and discharged two more times over the next half-year. When I left the hospital for the last time in August 1991, I was 38, and while no longer intent on self-destruction, I was more accurately rescued, not restored. Taking care of children and running a household seemed like a herculean task. My husband and I realized we needed a full-time housekeeper. We found a wonderful woman who knew just what needed to be done: cook, clean and be a surrogate mother. While appreciative of her help, I felt as if my role had been usurped. I continued to see my doctor every week as an outpatient. But I was demoralized and failed to see much of a change. I asked him how he healed my father, maintaining him on only three lithium tablets a day, whereas I had experimented with about 100 different combinations and dosages of medications (including antidepressants like monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclics and, later, S.S.R.I.s). Because, he said, your dad was a Ford. You are a Ferrari. I didnt know if this was a compliment or an insult. The first few years after my last hospitalization, I spent a lot of time on the shore of Lake Michigan, near my home. I collected hundreds of beach stones and organized them by size, color, shape and heft. Soon I had dozens of shoe boxes full of them. Sometimes I talked to the Russian fishermen looking for smelt on the pier; other times I walked alongside older women and helped them look for sea glass. I took three-hour naps every afternoon, trying to remember to set the alarm clock, so I would be awake when the kids came home from school. Many times they met a closed bedroom door. By 1995, I started to feel small changes. The medications were the same. I was still seeing my fathers doctor. I had the same support from my family and from my husband, who once, when I came home on a day pass, had pansies  my favorite flowers  planted along the path from the driveway to the house. The protective cocoon he made for me, along with time, allowed my self to regrow. I could feel my self filling in. Gradually, I was able to fulfill more of my maternal role: helping with homework, driving to piano lessons, making the worst Rice Krispies Treats in the school. Our housekeeper, while still a tremendous support, was becoming more of a safety net than a primary caregiver. One of my favorite things was driving in the car with the kids, singing along to oldies, trying to answer their questions: Is the sun going to fall on the earth? Where is the first car? Why are some books called a turn-pager? I had lunch with family members and the occasional friend. With confidence easing its way back to my self, I volunteered at an anorexia foundation near my house. I lined the edges of my desk with stones. Writing was getting easier, words were unlocking. One day I was on the porch with the two younger kids, who were doodling with crayons, when I wrote down the word pain. Without thinking, I picked up a crayon and added the letter T to the end of the word. A half-hour later, we were at an art-supply store, buying brushes, tubes of paint and a canvas. We converted the unused third floor of our house into a cavernous studio. Passion had returned and, along with it, creativity. One day, about eight years ago, it struck me that bipolar disorder was the hand I was dealt. I remembered what my father said to me when I moved from Boston: Dont look at what your disorder has taken away from you, try to find what it has given you. I began speaking to family-education classes of the local chapter of a mental-health organization. I presented a paper at a conference. The more often I spoke, the less traumatic my experience seemed, the less sad, the less painful and, somehow, the less personal. Over the years, Ive talked to clinicians about why the self is rarely mentioned in treating patients who suffer from mental illnesses that damage their sense of who they are. If anything, it seems that psychiatry is moving away from a model in which the self could be discussed. For many psychiatrists, mental disorders are medical problems to be treated with medications, and a patients crisis of self is not very likely to come up in a 15-minute session with a psychopharmacologist. Philip Yanos, an associate professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, in New York, studies the ways that a sense of self is affected by mental illness. He told me that when his work was under grant review, it was initially met with skepticism. Some thought that what he calls illness identity, which manifests in some patients as overidentifying with their mental disorder, was a topic of lesser importance in the face of other serious symptoms that patients experience, like cognitive impairment and thoughts of suicide. Yanos told me that reshaping your identity from patient to person takes time. For me, going from patient to person wasnt so arduous. Once I understood I was not vermicelli, part of my personhood was restored. But reconstructing my self took longer. One reason that may have been the case, as Amy Barnhorst, a psychiatrist at the University of California, Davis, told me, is the unique set of challenges facing people who have experienced mania and hypomania. The parts of the selves that may come out in mania and hypomania, which can be horrifying, are very real, she said, making it difficult for patients to reconcile those behaviors with their self as they have come to know it. In mania and hypomania, the sick self has no accountability; the improved self has a lot of explaining, and often apologizing, to do. For many people with mental disorders, the transformation of the self is one of the most disturbing things about being ill. And their despair is heightened when doctors dont engage with the issue, dont ask about what parts of the self have vanished and dont help figure out strategies to deal with that loss. Some in the mental-health field are beginning to recognize this need. Janina Fisher, a psychologist and the assistant director of the Sensorimotor Psychotherapy Institute in Broomfield, Colo., told me that there has been a sea change in the role the self plays in the therapeutic dialogue since the decades when I was sick. New therapies and treatment philosophies, founded mostly by clinical psychologists and other practitioners who are not medical doctors, recognize the role of the self in people with mental illness. Patients tell her, I just want to be that person I used to be. Fisher encourages her patients to recognize that their mental trauma is a part of their life, but shouldnt dominate it. In my own experience with Scheftner, whom I began seeing after my fathers doctor moved away, we talk about the self but only when I bring it up. Thats why I have enjoyed helping to run a support group for people with mental disorders, something Ive been doing for the last three years. There are usually 8 of us, sometimes 12. We sit in the basement of a local library every Wednesday afternoon. Though we know one anothers innermost thoughts, we are intimate strangers, not friends. Like A.A. and other self-help groups, were peer-led: run by and for people with mental disorders. We talk one by one about the past week  small achievements, setbacks, doctor appointments, family conflicts. While the self is not always an explicit topic, the loss of self  or for those doing better, the reconstruction of the self  is a hovering presence in the group. One day, not long ago, a middle-aged man came to our group. He told us that he spent the past year attending different grief groups, but none of them were right. Why not? someone asked. The man said: Because everyone there was grieving over the loss of another person. I was grieving for myself. For who I used to be before I got sick and who I am now. During the 20-odd years since my hospitalizations, many parts of my old self have been straggling home. But not everything made the return trip. While I no longer jump from moving cars on the way to parties, I still find social events uncomfortable. And, although I dont have to battle to stay awake during the day, I still dont have full days  Im only functional mornings to midafternoons. I havent been able to return to teaching. How many employers would welcome a request for a cot, a soft pillow and half the day off? One morning, about five years ago, my husband and I were talking on the family-room sofa. I was still wearing my pajamas and had wool hiking socks on. As he rubbed my feet, he told me he was leaving. It was, at once, a scene of tenderness and savagery. A little later, he threw some clothes into a suitcase and moved out. But my self  devastated, grieving, angry  remained intact. Today, my mind is nimble. Creative writing has crept back into my life. Ive made a couple of close friends in Chicago. My greatest pleasure is still my children  theyre starting careers, marrying, on the brinks of their lives. Im looking forward to grandchildren, to singing the 1950s favorite Life Is but a Dream while spinning those babies under the stars of a falling night on a Florida beach. This June, Im turning 60. Im having a small party to celebrate my ingathering of selves. My old self was first to R.S.V.P. 
 Bipolar Disorder I, II, Maybe III: There Are All Shades Beyond Blue Retrieved March 28, 2013 John McManamy writes an exceptionally informative article on the types of Bipolar Disorder as defined by the DSM-IV (the shrink handbook). You can get to his article and others by clicking here. I have pasted it below: There is far more to bipolar than meets the eye. Lets start with the boring stuff: The DSM-IV (the diagnostic Bible published by theAmerican Psychiatric Association) divides bipolar disorder into two types, rather unimaginatively labeled bipolar I and bipolar II. Raging and Swinging are far more apt: Bipolar I Raging bipolar (I) is characterized by at least one full-blown manic episode lasting at least one week or any duration if hospitalization is required. This may include inflated self-esteem or grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, being more talkative than usual, flight of ideas, distractibility, increase in goal-oriented activity, and excessive involvement in risky activities. The symptoms are severe enough to disrupt the patients ability to work and socialize, and may require hospitalization to prevent harm to himself or others. The patient may lose touch with reality to the point of being psychotic. The other option for raging bipolar is at least one mixed episode on the part of the patient. The DSM-IV is uncharacteristically vague as to what constitutes mixed, an accurate reflection of the confusion within the psychiatric profession. More tellingly, a mixed episode is almost impossible to explain to the public. One is literally up and down at the same time. The pioneering German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin around the turn of the twentieth century divided mania into four classes, including hypomania, acute mania, delusional or psychotic mania, and depressive or anxious mania (ie mixed). Researchers at Duke University, following a study of 327 bipolar inpatients, have refined this to five categories: Pure Type 1 (20.5 percent of sample) resembles Kraepelins hypomania, with euphoric mood, humor, grandiosity, decreased sleep, psychomotor acceleration, and hypersexuality. Absent was aggression and paranoia, with low irritability. Pure Type 2 (24.5 of sample), by contrast, is a very severe form of classic mania, similar to Kraepelins acute mania with prominent euphoria, irritability, volatility, sexual drive, grandiosity, and high levels of psychosis, paranoia, and aggression. Group 3 (18 percent) had high ratings of psychosis, paranoia, delusional grandiosity and delusional lack of insight, but lower levels of psychomotor and hedonic activation than the first two types. Resembling Kraepelins delusional mania, patients also had low ratings of dysphoria. Group 4 (21.4 percent) had the highest ratings of dysphoria and the lowest of hedonic activation. Corresponding with Kraepelins depressive or anxious mania, these patients were marked by prominent depressed mood, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and feelings of guilt, along with high levels of irritability, aggression, psychosis, and paranoid thinking. Group 5 patients (15.6 percent) also had notable dysphoric features (though not of suicidality or guilt) as well as Type 2 euphoria. Though this category was not formalized by Kraepelin, he acknowledged that the doctrine of mixed states is  too incomplete for a more thorough characterization  The study notes that while Groups 4 and 5 comprised 37 percent of all manic episodes in their sample, only 13 percent of the subjects met DSM criteria for a mixed bipolar episode, and of these, 86 percent fell into Group 4, leading the authors to conclude that the DSM criteria for a mixed episode is too restrictive. Different manias often demand different medications. Lithium, for example, is effective for classic mania while Depakote is the treatment of choice for mixed mania. The next DSM is likely to expand on mania. In a grand rounds lecture delivered at UCLA in March 2003, Susan McElroy MD of the University of Cincinnati outlined her four domains of mania, namely: As well as the classic DSM-IV symptoms (eg euphoria and grandiosity), there are also psychotic symptoms, with all the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia also in mania. Then there is negative mood and behavior, including depression, anxiety, irritability, violence, or suicide. Finally, there are cognitive symptoms, such as racing thoughts, distractibility, disorganization, and inattentiveness. Unfortunately, if you have thought disorder problems, you get all sorts of points for schizophrenia, but not for mania unless there are racing thoughts and distractibility. Kay Jamison in Touched with Fire writes: The illness encompasses the extremes of human experience. Thinking can range from florid psychosis, or madness, to patterns of unusually clear, fast, and creative associations, to retardation so profound that no meaningful activity can occur. The DSM-IV has given delusional or psychotic mania its own separate diagnosis as schizoaffective disorder  a sort of hybrid between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, but this may be a completely artificial distinction. These days, psychiatrists are acknowledging psychotic features as part of the illness, and are finding the newer generation of antipsychotics such as Zyprexa effective in treating mania. As Terrance Ketter MD of Yale told the 2001 National Depressive and Manic Depressive Association Conference, it may be inappropriate to have a discrete cut between the two disorders when both may represent part of a spectrum. At the 2003 Fifth International Conference on Bipolar Disorder, Gary Sachs MD of Harvard and principal investigator of the NIMH-funded STEP-BD reported that of the first 500 patients in the study, 52.8 percent of bipolar I patients and 46.1 percent of bipolar II patients had a co-occurring (comorbid) anxiety disorder. Dr Sachs suggested that in light of these numbers, comorbid may be a misnomer, that anxiety could actually be a manifestation of bipolar. About 60 percent of bipolar patients with a current anxiety disorder had attempted suicide as opposed to 30 percent with no anxiety. Among those with PTSD, more than 70 percent had attempted suicide. Depression is not a necessary component of raging bipolar, though it is strongly implied what goes up must come down. The DSM-IV subdivides bipolar I into those presenting with a single manic episode with no past major depression, and those who have had a past major depression (corresponding to the DSM -IV for unipolar depression). Bipolar II Swinging bipolar (II) presumes at least one major depressive episode, plus at least one hypomanic episode over at least four days. The same characteristics as mania are evident, with the disturbance of mood observable by others, but the episode is not enough to disrupt normal functioning or necessitate hospitalization, and there are no psychotic features. Those in a state of hypomania are typically the life of the party, the salesperson of the month, and more often than not the best-selling author or Fortune 500 mover and shaker, which is why so many refuse to seek treatment. But the same condition can also turn on its victim, resulting in bad decision-making, social embarrassments, wrecked relationships, and projects left unfinished. Hypomania can also occur in those with raging bipolar, and may be the prelude to a full-blown manic episode. While working on the American Psychiatric Associations latest DSM version of bipolar (IV-TR), Trisha Suppes MD, PhD of the University of Texas Medical Center in Dallas carefully read its criteria for hypomania, and had an epiphany. I said, wait, she told a UCLA grand rounds lecture in April 2003 and webcast the same day, where are all those patients of mine who are hypomanic and say they dont feel good? Apparently, there is more to hypomania than mere mania lite. Dr Suppes had in mind a different type of patient, say one who experiences road rage and cant sleep. Why was there no mention of that in hypomania? she wondered. A subsequent literature search yielded virtually no data. The DSM alludes to mixed states where full-blown mania and major depression collide in a raging sound and fury, but nowhere does it account for more subtle manifestations, often the type of states many bipolar patients may spend a good deal of their lives in. The treatment implications can be enormous. Dr Suppes referred to a secondary analysis Swann of a Bowden et al study of patients with acute mania on lithium or Depakote which found that even two or three depressed symptoms in mania were a predictor of outcome. Clinicians commonly refer to these under-the-DSM radar mixed states as dysphoric hypomania or agitated depression, often using the terms interchangeably. Dr Suppes defines the former as an energized depression, which she and her colleagues made the object of in a prospective study of 919 outpatients from the Stanley Bipolar Treatment Network. Of 17,648 patient visits, 6993 involved depressive symptoms, 1,294 hypomania, and 9,361 were euthymic (symptom-free). Of the hypomania visits, 60 percent (783) met her criteria for dysphoric hypomania. Females accounted for 58.3 percent of those with the condition. Neither the pioneering TIMA Bipolar Algorithms nor the APAs Revised Practice Guideline (with Dr Suppes a major contributor to both) offer specific recommendations for treating dysphoric hypomania, such is our lack of knowledge. Clearly the day will come when psychiatrists will probe for depressive symptoms or mere suggestions of symptoms in mania or hypomania, knowing this will guide them in the prescriptions they write, thus adding an element of science to the largely hit or miss practice that governs much of meds treatment today. But that day isnt here yet. Bipolar Depression Major depression is part of the DSM-IV criteria for swinging bipolar, but the next edition of the DSM may have to revisit what constitutes the downward aspect of this illness (see Bipolar Depression article). At present, the DSM-IV criteria for major unipolar depression pinch-hits for a genuine bipolar depression diagnosis. On the surface, there is little to distinguish between bipolar and unipolar depression, but certain atypical features may indicate different forces at work inside the brain. According to Francis Mondimore MD, assistant professor at Johns Hopkins and author of Bipolar Disorder: A Guide for Patients and Families, talking to a 2002 DRADA conference, people with bipolar depression are more likely to have psychotic features and slowed-down depressions (such as sleeping too much) while those with unipolar depression are more prone to crying spells and significant anxiety (with difficulty falling asleep). Because bipolar II patients spend far more time depressed than hypomanic (50 percent depressed vs one percent hypomanic, according to a 2002 NIMH study) misdiagnosis is common. According to S Nassir Ghaemi MD bipolar II patients 11.6 years from first contact with the mental health system to achieve a correct diagnosis. The implications for treatment are enormous. All too often, bipolar II patients are given just an antidepressant for their depression, which may confer no clinical benefit, but which can drastically worsen the outcome of their illness, including switches into mania or hypomania and cycle acceleration. Bipolar depression calls for a far more sophisticated meds approach, which makes it absolutely essential that those with bipolar II get the right diagnosis. This bears emphasis: The hypomanias of bipolar II  at least the ones with no mixed features  are generally easily managed or may not present a problem. But until those hypomanias are identified, a correct diagnosis may not be possible. And without that diagnosis, your depression  the real problem  will not get the right treatment, which could prolong your suffering for years. Bipolar I vs Bipolar II Dividing bipolar into I and II arguably has more to do with diagnostic convenience than true biology. A University of Chicago/Johns Hopkins study, however, makes a strong case for a genetic distinction. That study found a greater sharing of alleles (one of two or more alternate forms of a gene) along the chromosome 18q21in siblings with bipolar II than mere randomness would account for. A 2003 NMIH study tracking 135 bipolar I and 71 bipolar II patients for up to 20 years found: Both BP I and BP II patients had similar demographics and ages of onset at first episode.Both had more lifetime co-occurring substance abuse than the general population.BP II had significantly higher lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders, especially social and other phobias.BP Is had more severe episodes at intake.BP IIs had a substantially more chronic course, with significantly more major and minor depressive episodes and shorter inter-episode well intervals. Nevertheless, for many people, bipolar II may be bipolar I waiting to happen. Cyclothymia A likely candidate for the DSM-V as bipolar III is cyclothymia, (see article) listed in the DSM as a separate disorder, characterized by symptoms (but not necessarily full episodes of) hypomania and mild depression. One third of those with cyclothymia are eventually diagnosed with bipolar, lending credence to the kindling theory of bipolar disorder, that if left untreated in its early stages the illness will break out into something far more severe later on. Spectrum Considerations The DSMs one-week minimum for mania and four-day minimum for hypomania are regarded by many experts as artificial criteria. The British Association for Psychopharmacologys 2003 Evidence-based Guidelines for Treating Bipolar Disorder, for instance, notes that when the four-day minimum was reduced to two in a sample population in Zurich, the rate of those with bipolar II jumped from 0.4 percent to 5.3 percent. The point is that diagnostic categories are arbitrary, at best. A strong case can be made that the current ones are overly inclusive of unipolar depression at the expense of bipolar disorder. (See The Mood Spectrum and related articles.) Scientific Theories The cause and workings of the disorder are terra incognita to science, though there are lots of theories based on encouraging genetics, imaging, and brain science studies. A sampling of what is going on is offered by way of a 2001 Newsletter report: At the Fourth International Conference on Bipolar Disorder in June 2001, Paul Harrison MD, MRC Psych of Oxford reported on the Stanley Foundations pooled research of 60 brains and other studies: Among the usual suspects in the brain for bipolar are mild ventricular enlargement, smaller cingulate cortex, and an enlarged amygdala and smaller hippocampus. The classical theory of the brain is that the neurons do all the exciting stuff while the glia acts as mind glue. Now science is finding that astrocytes (a type of glia) and neurons are anatomically and functionally related, with an impact on synaptic activity. By measuring various synaptic protein genes and finding corresponding decreases in glial action, researchers have uncovered perhaps more [brain] abnormalities  in bipolar disorder than would have been expected. These anomalies overlap with schizophrenia, but not with unipolar depression. Dr Harrison concluded that there is probably a structural neuropathology of bipolar disorder situated in the medial prefrontal cortex and possibly other connected brain regions. Conclusion So little is actually known about the illness that the pharmaceutical industry has yet to develop a drug to treat its symptoms. Lithium, the best-known mood stabilizer, is a common salt, not a proprietary drug. Drugs used as mood stabilizers  Depakote, Neurontin, Lamictal, Topamax, and Tegretol  came on the market as antiseizure medications for treating epilepsy. Antidepressants were developed with unipolar depression in mind, and antipsychotics went into production to treat schizophrenia. Inevitably, a bipolar pill will find its way to the market, and there will be an eager queue of desperate people lining up to be treated. Make no mistake, there is nothing glamorous or romantic about an illness that destroys up to one in five of those who have it, and wreaks havoc on the survivors, not to mention their families. The streets and prisons are littered with wrecked lives. Vincent Van Gogh may have created great works of art, but his death in his brothers arms at age 37 was not a pretty picture. The standard propaganda about bipolar is that it is the result of a chemical imbalance in the brain, a physical condition not unlike diabetes. For the purposes of gaining acceptance in society, most people with bipolar seem to go along with this blatant half-truth. True, a chemical storm is raging in the brain, but the analogy to the one taking place in the diabetics pancreas is totally misleading. Unlike diabetes and other physical diseases, bipolar defines who we are, from the way we perceive colors and listen to music to how we taste our food. We dont HAVE bipolar. We ARE bipolar, for both better and worse.

 Psychologic treatment has long-term benefits for bipolar patients By Mark Cowen, Medwire News 04 January 2013 Eur Psychiatry 2012; Advance online publication Psychoeducation and cognitive behavioral therapy combined with pharmacologic treatment provides significant long-term benefits for patients with refractory bipolar disorder (BD), researchers report. The team found that the 20 BD patients randomly assigned to the combined therapy group showed significant reductions in persistent affective symptoms and improvements in social-occupational functioning over 5 years of follow up compared with the 20 control patients assigned to receive pharmacologic treatment alone. Patients in the combined therapy group also showed significant reductions in hospitalization rates over the study period compared with controls. "As far as we know, this is the first study to show such long-term maintained efficacy of a combined pharmacological plus psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioral therapy program in subjects with refractory bipolar disorder," comment the researchers in European Psychiatry. There were no significant between-group differences regarding gender distribution, number of hospitalizations, use of lithium or other mood stabilizers, or adherence rates at baseline. Overall, 75% of patients in each group had persistent affective symptoms (Beck's Depression Index score >7; Young Mania Rating Scale score >6) and/or severe difficulties in social-occupational functioning (Misadjustment Scale score >14) at baseline. The remaining patients had experienced two or more relapse events during the previous year. However, the percentage of patients with such symptoms at the 6-month, 12-month, and 5-year evaluations was significantly lower in the combined treatment than control group, at 40% versus 80%, 30% versus 83%, and 20% versus 89%, respectively. Patients in the combined treatment group also had a lower mean number of recent hospitalizations than those in the control group at the 12-month and 5-year evaluations, at 0.00 versus 0.39, and 0.02 versus 1.06, respectively. In addition, anxiety levels, as assessed using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, were significantly lower in the combined treatment than control group at all follow-up evaluations. Ana González-Isasi (Hospital Universitario Insular, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain) and team conclude: "Combined treatment proved better than pharmacological treatment in relieving mania, depression and anxiety symptoms after 6 months and in producing better adjustment to everyday life upon termination of treatment. These benefits were maintained after 5 years." They add: "Our results support the view that the benefits of a psychological treatment do not dissipate over time." Free abstract 
 Does anyone ever get REALLY REALLY irritated and frustrated with everything and especially with people, feel likes your head is going to explode and you just wanna cry but at the same time you feel.. Dont know if the word is happy im looking for? but you want to do so much stuff ( projects ) and have so much energy... but all the thoughts and feelings are conflicting so you just sit there staring at the PC or walls for hours and hours. Is this a normal? I have a lot of things on my mind.. i have been trying to explain to my martial arts coaches about my AvPD and bipolar and he really doesnt care and i making me do things i cant do... like in January he wants me to teach a class... I told him i really cant and he said ive to act my age and grow up and get on with life. 
 Celebs coming out with bipolar? Bring it on! By Nigel Griffiths 26 November 2012 When I tell people I have bipolar these days the response I get is quite different to how it was just a few years ago. The old response was “What’s that?” but nowadays I’m more likely to hear “Catherine Zeta Jones has that!” or “Isn’t Robbie Williams bipolar?” Positive representation of someone with a bipolar disorder can only be a good thing in helping people understand and come to terms with the illness. This is some of my story. It was late 2006, we were watching Stephen Fry’s “Secret Diary of a Manic Depressive” on Channel 4 and my wife quite simply said “That’s you, that is!” For the previous ten years I had been treated for depression. I wasn’t depressed all of this time, but you don’t go to the Doc when you’re feeling on top of the world, do you? During the previous few years, I had lost three senior management jobs for what, I now know was classic bipolar behaviour. When high I often felt full of great new ideas and making important plans, but I ended up doing things with disastrous consequences. At times I was quite delusional, confident that I was going to be Wales’ first management guru, writing books and speaking to a huge audience. At times I would demand and constantly fracture relationships. At other times, I was so low; I could just bury my head in the sand, whilst problems were taking shape around me. The final straw in my last employed role was locking myself in my office and taking a handful of sleeping tablets. The serious mental illness known as Bipolar Disorder can affect 2% of the UK population. Sometimes known as manic depression, bipolar is characterised by significant mood swings including manic highs and depressive lows. Most of us with the diagnosis experience alternating episodes of mania and depression. It isn’t just the person with the diagnosis that can be hit by the illness, but partners, children, the extended family as well as work colleagues and friends can be caught in the net. My experience of failing to get a proper diagnosis for so long is fairly typical as many people wait for up to 13 years to get the right diagnosis. The symptoms can first occur and then reoccur when work, studies, family or emotional pressures are at their greatest. In women it can also be triggered by childbirth or during the menopause. In my case, I’m in my forties, but now that I know about bipolar I can trace episodes going back to my schooldays and believe it was first triggered by a close family bereavement. The key to coping with bipolar is an early diagnosis, acceptance of the illness and adapting your lifestyle so you are in control as much as possible. Management of the illness can be achieved through strategies involving medication, health care, therapy and self- management. Getting a bipolar disorder diagnosis back in 2007 lifted off a huge burden as I my destructive behaviour in the past made sense. However, I wasn’t sure how to manage my illness. I had come away from the psychiatrist with a bag of medication – mood stabilisers, antidepressants, antianxiety pills, sleeping tablets and a load of information about help from voluntary organisations that was out of date. During my first year after diagnosis I was experimenting with drugs. It took a while to get the right mix. I faced difficult times as some of the side-effects were very strong, but they do go away in time and I can at least discern what I am feeling or when another bipolar episode is about to come. By far, the next major milestone after watching Stephen Fry was joining a local self-help group established by Bipolar UK (then known as the Manic Depression Fellowship). It took about six months to work up the courage and confidence to join, but I was really glad I did. A warm welcome and listening to other people’s anecdotes of their bipolar experiences was both comforting and encouraging. Members of the group told me about self-management training – a weekend learning to identify warning signs and triggers and ways we can be more proactive in managing our symptoms. Also a huge benefit was the opportunity to meet other people with bipolar disorder. Are celebs coming out with bipolar? Bring it on, I would say. Handled respectfully, famous people with a bipolar disorder can really help to raise awareness and be positive role models for others to follow. For more information visit Bipolar UK. 
 ADHD linked to altered neural activation in bipolar patients By Mark Cowen, medwireNews October 26, 2012 Bipolar disorder (BD) patients with and without comorbid attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) differ in neural activation patterns during response inhibition, results from a US study show. The team found that BD patients with ADHD (BD+ADHD) had significantly greater activation in a number of brain regions than those with BD alone. The findings, published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, suggest that in neuroimaging studies, "grouping the BD [alone] and BD+ADHD participants together may lead to incorrect conclusions about the pathophysiology of BD," say Lori Altshuler (David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles) and colleagues. The researchers studied 16 patients with BD alone, 16 with BD+ADHD, 16 with ADHD alone, and 30 mentally healthy controls. All four groups were similar in term of mean age and gender distribution. In addition, there were no significant differences between the BD alone and BD+ADHD groups regarding mood symptom severity, and no significant difference between the ADHD alone and BD+ADHD groups regarding ADHD symptom severity. All of the participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain while performing a response inhibition task (the Go/No-Go task). Analysis of the findings revealed that patients in the BD+ADHD group had significantly greater activation in the anterior cingulate (Brodmann area [BA] 24/32), the posterior cingulate, and bilateral thalamus than those with BD alone. BD+ADHD participants also showed significantly greater activation than those with BD alone in the left inferior frontal cortex (BA 44), the right superior frontal gyrus (BA 10), the right parahippocampal, and left supramarginal gyrus. There were no significant areas of increased activation in BD alone patients versus BD+ADHD patients. The team also found that BD+ADHD patients had significantly greater activation than controls in the bilateral anterior cingulate (BA 24/32), posterior cingulate, right thalamus, bilateral medial frontal gyrus (BA 9) and left parahippocampal gyrus. There were no areas where controls had significantly greater activation than BD+ADHD patients. Altshuler et al conclude: "Future studies that examine not only neural differences in specific brain regions, but also assess how these regions may interact (connectivity studies) may provide further insight into the differences in neural patterns in BD, BD+ADHD, and ADHD." 
 Three years ago I put myself in a hospital for 2 weeks. After that I participated in an outpatient program for 6 weeks. I was given a tentative diagnosis of mood disorder. I recovered, but I still have episodes of extreme irritability. They usually pass in a day or so, and I rarely do anything except grumble and maybe curse out loud. If I scream in frustration I usually go somewhere to be alone and get it out of my system. Once or twice in my life I've become "crazy angry" and done something stupid like smash a record player (it was mine) with a bat or verbally attack someone for what I believe is something they have done to hurt me. However, I have none of the accompanying symptoms of bipolar like unrealistic goals and expectations, feeling really good or confident, fast speech, going without sleep, etc. I do get depressed on occasion but I haven't been what I would call extremely depressed (suicidal, unable to work, sleeping all the time ... that sort of thing) but maybe 3 times in my life and those times it passed within a few days. What else can result in episodes of dysthymia and, more often, agitation/irritability other than just exhaustion and stress? I've been under a lot of stress lately because I am responsible for my 92 year old mother and because I work 50+ hours a week at a stressful job. Those are triggers for a lot of emotional turmoil for me mainly because my childhood was so messed up by two abusive parents and two abusive older siblings. But the episodes of agitation and irritability have been more frequent the past 6 months. I finally got my mother to move to Assisted Living in August, and I thought that would relieve some stress, but she calls me at least 5 times a week because someone has robbed her, she has no money, she needs a ride somewhere, she needs clothes, someone in the home has been rude to her, etc., etc., etc. The Assisted Living staff are trying to help, but short of removing her phone there is little that can be done. Most of the time I don't answer my phone, but I listen to her messages later. Even that throws me into a state with my heart racing, panicky thoughts and fast breathing -- which points to anxiety. Maybe there is no name for this ... maybe its just who I am, but with two failed marriages in my past I'm thinking this pattern must point to a disorder of some kind. Can PTSD cause this sort of thing? Could I be narcissistic or borderline? Any ideas? (Yeah, I know the part about going to a therapist. I've tried two people here where I live and neither seemed interested in helping me get to the bottom of this.) I'm just wondering if I need to see a psychiatrist again or if this can be managed with therapy? 
 Creativity 'closely entwined with mental illness' By Michelle Roberts, Health editor, BBC News online October 16, 2012 Creativity is often part of a mental illness, with writers particularly susceptible, according to a study of more than a million people. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, the Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute found. They were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. The dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder. As a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people. But they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports. Lead researcher Dr Simon Kyaga said the findings suggested disorders should be viewed in a new light and that certain traits might be beneficial or desirable. For example, the restrictive and intense interests of someone with autism and the manic drive of a person with bipolar disorder might provide the necessary focus and determination for genius and creativity. Similarly, the disordered thoughts associated with schizophrenia might spark the all-important originality element of a masterpiece. Dr Kyaga said: "If one takes the view that certain phenomena associated with the patient's illness are beneficial, it opens the way for a new approach to treatment. "In that case, the doctor and patient must come to an agreement on what is to be treated, and at what cost. In psychiatry and medicine generally there has been a tradition to see the disease in black-and-white terms and to endeavour to treat the patient by removing everything regarded as morbid." Beth Murphy, head of information at Mind, said bipolar disorder personality traits could be beneficial to those in creative professions, but it may also be that people with bipolar disorder are more attracted to professions where they can use their creative skills. "It is important that we do not romanticise people with mental health problems, who are too often portrayed as struggling creative geniuses. We know that one in four people will be diagnosed with a mental health problem this year and that these individuals will come from a range of different backgrounds, professions and walks of live. Our main concern is that they get the information and support that they need and deserve." ---------- Post Merged at 05:40 PM ---------- Previous Post was at 05:34 PM ---------- I come from a very artistic family, I myself write, paint and was a child prodigy musically, I still play and obsessively collect music. It would be nice if this research helped creative types with emotional difficulties to be accepted more on their talents rather than the consideration that say an employer may need to have for an employee with depression. It would nice if the model I was speaking about in another thread where in Glasgow (Scotland)there is a initiative to employ school leavers with autism in careers that use autistic traits ,like good time keeping, eye for detail and exactitude etc and this model was used for people who are creative but suffer depression, bipolar etc. 
 I'm at home, alone, and it's 9/11 again. I took part in the construction of those 2 buildings - I worked in the purchasing department of one of the electrical construction companies, talked with the guys building those towers a couple of times a week. Helped my boss with ordering materials. On 9/11/01, I was working with an officer in a prison whose brother-in-law was in one of those buildings and died. Everyone in the medical unit with me watched the towers go down, live on TV -- 75 miles north of the site. Many of us grew up in NYC, and lived part of our adult lives there, myself included. 3 months after the attack, I got a promotion and transferred to a state university, and the students and staff were still in the throes of mourning. Many, many had lost loved ones at the World Trade Center. A few of our students even lost both parents in those buildings. What a shock for them! They were still holding memorial gatherings on campus periodically in memory of those lost, and it helped them through the trauma. Every Sept 11th since the day of the attack, I find myself in tears, full of inexplicable aching inside, emotional and mental pain. I have never been able to watch TV on the anniversaries. This morning, I made myself watch about 5 minutes. That's all I could manage. Tears are running down my face as I write this. It was 11 years ago. I am a fighter for my recovery from bipolar and one who works hard at moving forward, always setting the bar higher, setting goals, analyzing and challenging myself. Yet this is one area where I've made little progress. I am hurting deeply and thought perhaps by writing and sharing it might help. It hasn't. I visited my psychologist a few days ago and talked about it because I knew today was coming. We talked about desensitization, and how for something traumatic it takes hard work and a very long time to lessen the effects. Everything else in my life I have faced the challenges head on. With 9/11, I have avoided it. Avoided TV accounts, talking about it, reading about it -- it's just too painful. Today, I tried to watch a little bit of the TV reporting about 9/11 and could only handle 5 minutes. And I'm writing and sharing with you here. Both in an attempt to look at the event and my emotions square in the eye to deal with them. This is gut wrenchingly painful. But perhaps it is a first step. How long until is becomes just another sad memory without the pain? I try to keep my emotions reigned in because to feel it freely and let my mind go through it all, I worry about setting off another mood swing. Perhaps I should set myself free to feel and then just deal with whatever comes. It's not that I don't know how to handle the mood swings. But I prefer stability. Any thoughts? 
 Editorial comment: This is on one level a moving first-person account of the experience of living a life with bipolar disorder. But on a larger level it is a remarkable testament to the power and determination of the human spirit. Regardless of your clinical or scientific orientation, it is well worth the read. ~ David Baxter How I Found Ecstasy In Depression by Tom Wootton, Bipolar Advantage July 30, 2012 Depression can help us to find beauty in every moment. 102287-99637.jpg I have been meditating for over 50 years. I started when I was five years old when I became fascinated with watching my breath go in and out. I intuitively knew that this and other meditative practices would bring me to a state of ecstasy. It didn't take long before pursuing that state became the most important thing in my life.Although I got incredibly close through my efforts in meditation, it wasn't until I looked for ecstasy in depression that I truly found it. Once I found ecstasy in depression I found it everywhere. My hope is that sharing my experience might help others to find the same insights that I have. As I watched my breath go in and out I found some dramatic changes in my state of consciousness. I would detach from my body and find myself floating above and looking down at myself sitting there. It was a very pleasurable state, but also very profound in how I viewed the world. I believed that part of me was untouched by the physical world; the part that I now call my soul. It wasn't long before my soul separations started encroaching on my waking states. I would often find myself turning the corner and suddenly being in a long tunnel with a light at the end of it. During those experiences time would stand still or at least slow down dramatically. I interpreted these experiences as seeing God. By the time I was in my teens I knew that there were others who had experienced some of the same things. They called such moments ecstasy, bliss, Nirvana, Samadhi, superconsciousness, equanimity, "oneness with God," and many other names. Although I recognized that there are many ways to reach such states, I started practicing Yoga since it was the most attractive to me of all of the different approaches to finding them. I was much less interested in the philosophies than how to experience ecstasy directly and Yoga offered a path that was geared toward direct experience. In my twenties I realized that there were people who were experiencing things far beyond what I had and seemed to have a much deeper understanding of them than I. I met with as many as I could find and spent most of my time studying the lives of saints. This search for meaning dominated my thoughts as my meditation practices deepened. By the time I was thirty I was living in a monastery and meditating anywhere from 8 to 24 hours a day. I had found a community of people who valued such experiences as much as myself and for the first time I felt completely at home. We meditated for hours together, but when the meditation ended I would keep at it because I thought that my next breath was going to be the one that gave me permanent bliss. By then I was able to travel down the tunnel and bask in the light at the end for what felt like a timeless eternity. I appeared to be so good at generating higher states of consciousness that fellow monks called me "Samadhi Tom." Right about the time that I thought I was about to reach the final realization of permanent ecstasy I fell into an incredibly deep depression that lasted several months. I had been depressed many times before, but nothing like this one. I was so debilitated that they had to move me into the building with the kitchen because I was unable to even walk across the courtyard to eat. I laid in bed crying all day and couldn't even attend the meditations or practice in my room. This was my first truly debilitating depression and it had extreme consequences. It took away the most important thing in my life. At the time I thought I had lost everything and life was devoid of all meaning. I left the monastery and floundered for several years. I spent my forties lost in turmoil. I pursued a life of no purpose and allowed myself to become a person that I really hated. I made a lot of money, but said that I had rented my soul to the devil while allowing myself to stray the furthest I ever had from the only thing that really mattered. The depressions and manias became much more frequent during this time. When they had gotten to the point that I was completely nonfunctional, I finally got diagnosed as Depressed and then more accurately as Bipolar. I saw it as a kind of a death sentence combined with a an explanation for so many of the things that happened throughout my life. I realized that my first full on manic episode happened when I was nine years old, for example, and that depression was at least a yearly occurrence. Because of the diagnosis and the prevalence of delusional thinking being a part of it, I looked upon all of the experiences of my life as a sign of my mental illness instead of a sign that I was seeing God. I was devastated by the implications of it. My next "tunnel" experience left me crying in despair that I had been so foolish to think that such experiences meant anything other than that I was crazy. In deep despair of having no meaningful existence whatsoever, I attempted suicide. Fortunately, I failed and subsequently set out to find meaning through my bipolar condition instead of trying to make it go away. At the time, and even today for most people, the idea is blasphemous to the paradigm that says it is impossible and one would be delusional to even try. My fifties have been a time of great renewal. It is when my whole life started to make sense and everything came together. I wrote The Depression Advantage as an exploration of how others throughout history had gone through some of the same turmoils and achieved the goal I was seeking. I wrote chapters about the lives of saints who had experienced at least parts of my physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual pains and how they ultimately found that the goal they sought was actually within those experiences. I was especially taken with the story of St. Teresa of Avila. Although she found her "oneness with God" through her experience of physical pain, I saw in her experience many insights that applied to my own battles with depression. For most of her life she assumed that she would not find her "oneness with God" unless she removed her physical pain, yet eventually found it in the pain itself. Since I was searching for the same thing as St. Teresa through my depressive experiences, I found great meaning in her life. Once Teresa found her "oneness with God," she tried to help others to achieve the same goal. She helped many people through her writings, but also found it hard to communicate her truth with those who could not fathom the apparent contradiction in saying pain could be blissful. One of the things she said in trying to explain it was, "The pain is still there. It bothers me so little now that I feel my soul is served by it." I was so moved by this statement that I found myself repeating it over and over again throughout the day. I found it so compelling that I continued repeating it no matter what I was outwardly doing. After two months of repeating Teresa's quote I became very upset with her. I thought, "How can she say it bothered her so little when she was bedridden by the pain?" I now smile and think of her when people get upset with what I say. Yet, motivated by my desire to figure out how she had found permanent ecstasy and why I had not, I kept repeating the phrase for many more months. In the meantime, I was experiencing the deepest depression I ever had. I was bedridden and in extreme pain: physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Although I had the tools to make it go away and was in no danger of another suicide attempt, I allowed it to happen because I knew that the insight I was seeking was in my depression as it was in Teresa's physical pain. It finally dawned on me after about 10 months of repeating the quote and enduring the pain. When Teresa said, "It bothers me so little... " she didn't mean her body, but that part of her that I had touched in myself so long ago - her soul. In that moment I found the ecstasy that I had been seeking my entire life. This direct experience is completely different than the intellectual understanding that I had. It is real instead of imagined. My life changed from that moment on. Like Teresa, I had been avoiding the very thing that would give me the ecstasy that I was looking for. Having found ecstasy in my depression, I realized that my failed attempts in my previous efforts were because I didn't really understand what it truly meant to be in a state of bliss. I was mistaking the pleasurable feelings of highs for real equanimity which is beyond the likes and dislikes, pleasures and pains, or any of the dualities of life. Now that I found ecstasy, I see it in every moment of my life no matter what the circumstance or state of mind. I prefer to call it equanimity instead of the other terms because that better describes it for me: All states are equally blissful and there is no need to change any of them to be in permanent equanimity. In equanimity I can see that depression is part of the bliss just as much as pleasure, happiness, and all other conditions. Equanimity is the essence of Yoga as described in the Bhagavad-Gita: "Be steadfast in yoga, devotee. Perform your duty without attachment, remaining equal to success or failure. Such equanimity of mind is called Yoga." (Yogananda, Paramahansa, The Bhavagad Gita, translation, 2003 Self-Realization Fellowship, CA, 2:48) Although I would never discount the power of meditation as I see what it did to prepare me for such a state, I realize now that many people pursue ecstasy thinking that it can only be found in the right conditions. My experience taught me that unless you can find it in all conditions you are deluding yourself into thinking that highs are the same thing as equanimity. I would have never learned this critical lesson without the help of my extremely deep depressions. Nor would I have found it without the help of those who had already found equanimity in their own struggles. 
 From a behavioral standpoint, what are the differences between bipolar and borderline personality disorders? I have a friend who has distinct patterns of behavior - highly manipulative, never takes blame, obsessive about spending time with us, never understands our point of view and if we don't comply with her wishes - it erupts in a tirade. I have read a lot about both, but cannot find many differences. 
 http://www.bipolaradvantage.com January 11, 2012 The current standard of care as defined by the National Institute of Mental Health is to minimize symptoms and accept the high probability of relapse. While many tools have been developed to effectively manage bipolar disorder, there are far too many people who are still living on the edge of relapse and suffering greatly from it. Even for those who achieve a level of remission that is commonly called recovery, they live in constant fear that one sleepless night can send them into another crisis. Trapped in a vicious cycle of Crisis, Managed, Recovery, and Relapse is the very definition of bipolar disorder and its depressive counterpart unipolar disorder. Even in Recovery, the illness is lurking behind every thought, waiting for the slightest chance to trigger a new episode. It consigns its victims to a lifetime of fear and constant vigilance in an attempt to keep the flow of energy and information at bay. It is interesting that so many people have a different word than "recovery" for the state where we are limited to the comfort zone of no high or low symptoms. They do not call it "recovery," they call it "bored." It is one of the major reasons that they slip back into the Managed Stage and risk another Crisis. This is why the National Institute of Mental Health says, "in spite of modern, evidence-based treatment, bipolar disorder remains a highly recurrent, predominantly depressive illness." 
 Mood Swings of a Bipolar Friendship By Marybeth Smith, WebMD Friday, May 11, 2012 Smith_resized.jpg Marybeth Smith was diagnosed with Bipolar II at age 26. Marybeth created the website www.askabipolar.com in hopes of helping others understand what it’s like to suffer from mental illnesses. Marybeth is the author of the Amazon Kindle Best Seller and ABNA quarter-finalist, Fall Girl, and is currently working on the sequel while pursuing a degree in Child Psychology. Additionally, Marybeth designs websites, writes for bpHope Magazine and The International Bipolar Foundation, and serves as a board member for NAMI MI. There are people in this world who meet their best friend in Kindergarten and are friends forever. Others meet in high school. Some in college. They meet, they click, and the friendship grows, making the term ‘BFF’ an actual thing. Best Friends Forever. They exist. Not so much in my life. I met my best friend in Kindergarten. Then I switched schools. The same happened in first grade, and then I went best friendless until the seventh grade. We went to different high schools, and then she went to college. We stayed in touch, but grew apart. And then … there were the high school BFF’s. The symptoms of my illness really came to life in high school. Thus my friendships began to take a bit of a bipolar curve of their own. I’d get depressed and suddenly I was like a magnet with the opposite charge … everyone cleared the area and kept clear until I surfaced. Then I’d switch to a little hypomania and suddenly everyone was my friend. I was funny, I was entertaining, I was friendly, I was fun. Until I’d fall again. I’d crash. I’d turn into an irritable, depressing monster. Friends were lost, friends were made, and friends were lost again. Then new friends were made again. I was and am great at making friends … still, they pretty much all ended the same way. I’d get depressed and say or do stupid things and it’s goodbye friendship. I’d like to say this changed as I got older. I’d like to say it became easier to maintain friendships after my diagnosis. Unfortunately, it actually got a bit worse. There were friends I would stop being friends with and then start being friends with again about a year later only to go through the entire ordeal again. Now maybe these things happen to everyone. And then again, maybe it’s just a problem I have. But sometimes I wonder if it’s a problem that everyone who struggles with bipolar disorder experiences. Do you have a difficult time maintaining friendships? Do you think it has anything to do with your illness? 
 Trudeau shares mental health message, Former prime minister's wife tells story of her struggle with bipolar disorder May 10, 2012 By Kristy Strauss EMC news - Margaret Trudeau gave a candid account of her struggle with mental illness at the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre on May 4, recounting a life of depression, addiction and struggles with bipolar disorder.Trudeau - an author, mother, mental health advocate and former wife of prime minister Pierre Trudeau - spoke at the Royal's mental health and corrections conference about reaching out to mentally ill female offenders. "I haven't been incarcerated, but I've certainly offended," Trudeau joked as she opened her talk about her struggle with mental health. She spoke about her depression, reliance on drugs and alcohol and struggle with bipolar disorder. "I stopped dancing, playing, laughing, and you just get consumed by grey," Trudeau said. "I had no spark." Before she visited the Royal for help, she said she often blamed others, like her husband or nannies, for her depression. The highs and lows she went through dealing with bipolar disorder also left her feeling as if it couldn't be corrected. "I could be the best, the absolute best, or so detestable, so angry rude and mean," Trudeau said. "I certainly never had peace of mind until I accepted help." When she found herself being taken to the Royal by the police, she also said she didn't want to accept the fact that it was because of an untreated mental illness. "The first night I wouldn't sleep in the bed," Trudeau said. "I wouldn't stay in this prison." She also said she lost the ability to take care of herself, eat right and live a healthy life. "That's probably how you feel in prison," Trudeau said. "I felt like I let down everyone who lived me and knew me. I realized that I was ill, so ill, and I needed to take it on." She said that with the Royal's help, she felt like she was given a second chance - something that she feels women especially who are incarcerated should have. Trudeau also said that for women who don't have a mental illness going into prison, she's not sure what chances those women have of leading a healthy life afterwards. "Until you walk in someone's shoes, you don't know," Trudeau said. "The prisons are where we're putting our mentally ill, but we must help them." 
 So, I haven't posted for a while. I was diagnosed as Bipolar 2 after about 30 years of symptoms and misdiagnosis as major depression. Two years ago I started taking Seroquel XR 200 mg daily @8pm. Normally, this works very well. For the last couple of days, especially today, I have felt low, with low energy, flattish mood with spikes of irritability. My chest feels like there is a solid feeling of dread. I sleep either a couple of hours , or about 12 at a time. A couple of my usual triggers are there, but not so much as to trigger an episode normally. Not sure what to do about this, maybe it will go away on its own. I don't know if it is worth it to see my GP who manages my care now. 
 A Standing Ovation for Sinead By Courtney Rundell Friday, April 27, 2012 Rundell.jpg Courtney Rundell is a freelance blogger for the International Bipolar Foundation and the North Hollywood Patch. She speaks all over California about thriving with alcoholism, bipolar, and PTSD. When Courtney was diagnosed bipolar in 2006, a life she never knew was possible began. She’s devoted to inspiring and sparking hope in others now that she’s finally a free woman. Her personal blog can be found at www.BeePea.com. Sinead O’Connor’s recent decision to cancel her upcoming tour “due to bipolar disorder” took courage few know. While putting one’s career on hold due to cancer or Parkinson’s evokes worldwide sympathy, doing so because of mental illness shines a light on how much stigma still surrounds mental health issues. I know all too well the vulnerability it takes to admit defeat to mental illness. Six years ago, I was placed on a 72-hour hold in a locked down psychiatric unit and diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was committed because I was overcommitted. Shortly after getting my Master’s Degree, I landed my first paying directing gig when I was in the darkest depression I’d ever experienced. I felt like my career was finally taking off so I took the job, banking on the hope that my old frenetic energy would return like Mighty Mouse and save the day. Normally, I could summon the energy. When I was a stage actress, I used it to memorize lines. When I was a student, I employed it to stay up all night studying for an exam. After my tasks were achieved, I hibernated. I’d literally sleep around the clock until I was able to function again. That was simply how I operated, so it didn’t seem peculiar to me. But this time was different – that energy was nowhere to be found. My depression grew darker and heavier until I was finally buried and crushed by my rapidly piling responsibilities. My only answer was suicide. Then I was in an ambulance and the gig was up. Being diagnosed bipolar was shocking, yet it made sense. I often felt like I had two different personalities – one manic, one depressive. My manic self would run around making promises that my depressive self couldn’t possibly fulfill. Then the shame of not coming through on the promises I’d made only pushed me deeper into depression, creating a vicious circle of darkness and disgrace. Knowing that I let down many people was beyond humiliating. A deep sense of vulnerability and rawness came with admitting that I was too sick to follow through with my commitments and my sickness only magnified the already negative situation. My world fell apart, and while I felt like everyone was pointing and laughing at me, I was by no means in the public eye. I can’t begin to imagine what Sinead’s feeling right now. Sinead O’Connor has lived a life that most people can’t imagine. She’s toured the world. She’s the first-ever priestess to be ordained. She’s given of herself and her celebrity to fight hunger and poverty. She’s a human rights advocate and has spoken out against AIDS/HIV stigma. And she’s mother to four children. That in itself is a feat unimaginable to me. Therefore, in lieu of judgment, might I suggest we applaud Sinead’s bravery? Applaud her immeasurable courage. Applaud her honesty. Applaud her humanness. We are not our accomplishments. Tours can be rescheduled, life cannot. Brava, Sinead. Brava. 
 Separating What’s Bipolar From What’s Not by Joe Kraynak May 15, 2012 One of the things I hate most about bipolar disorder is how subtly sinister it can be when a loved one is trending toward mania — not manic yet or even hypomanic, just talking faster and louder, blurting out statements that are a little too open and honest and perhaps hurtful, and being more self-centered than usual. A lot of bad stuff can happen during these times to drive a wedge between loved ones, but nothing bad enough to convince the person or a doctor or therapist that bipolar is at work. During periods of low-grade pre-hypomania, uncertainty fogs the mind. In our family, we argue more and “walk on eggshells.” Everyone’s afraid to mention the elephant in the room out of fear of being accused of blaming bipolar disorder or the person who has it for our family drama. After all, the rest of us in the family are admittedly less than perfect, and even in a normal, healthy family (whatever that is), interpersonal conflicts arise. Remember: Blaming all relationship issues on bipolar disorder isn’t fair to the person who has bipolar and may mask non-bipolar related issues, but not acknowledging that bipolar disorder may be the root cause of relationship issues isn’t fair to anyone and can undermine attempts to deal effectively with what may be the underlying cause of those issues. I begin to doubt my instincts. Maybe it’s not bipolar this time. Maybe it’s something I said or did or a family dynamic we don’t yet comprehend. Perhaps it’s just normal family dysfunction. I find myself trying to referee battles between other family members to keep conflicts to a dull roar. (That never works, by the way.) Then, I get angry and frustrated that adults can’t seem to get along when we’re all essentially living in what a good portion of the world’s population would consider Paradise. Then I do something juvenile and cruel — I stop talking to everyone and mope around throwing myself a pity party. We all know the number one rule in dealing with family conflict resulting from mood instability: Treat the illness first. But knowing for sure that the illness is what needs treatment isn’t always so clear. We have fire alarms to warn us that the house is on fire and burglar alarms to warn us of intruders, but no alarm sounds and no lights flash when bipolar disorder sneaks in. Nor do we have an objective observer living with us to point out when bipolar disorder is disrupting our lives or it’s just human nature unleashed. As a result, we often engage in a waiting game until it becomes clear that bipolar disorder is at work or until emotions cool and we enter a period of relative calm. Unfortunately, that game is a dangerous one, during which a lot of relationship damage can occur and the risk of slipping into full-blown mania or depression increases dramatically. Recently, our daughter started seeing a therapist to work on her own issues that may be exacerbating the tension between her and her mom (my wife) who has bipolar disorder, and all three of us are starting family therapy. While I think that’s all great and long overdue, it seems that sometimes therapy is a pacifier — a drama we play out — until the real problem comes to light and is treated — the bipolar disorder. 
 Considering Relationship Dynamics by Joe Kraynak October 28, 2008 Syndicated from the Bipolar Blog In a previous post, Should I Go or Should I Stay?, I discuss the dilemma that many people face when living with someone who has bipolar disorder. Lately, Ive been thinking about relationship dynamics and how these dynamics can trigger confrontations. Im one of those people, for example, who really needs to please others. Ill clean the house, cook dinner, do laundry, plant flowers, and so forth, just to see her happy. (According to the book The Five Love Languages, my love language would be acts of service.) Unfortunately, when my partner is manic or in some mixed state (of hypomania and depression), nothing I do pleases her. She seems on edge  irritated by my mere presence. Sometimes, I take it personally. Then I get angry. Then, I spend a good deal of time justifying my anger. Here are some of the thoughts that go through my head during these times: With all I do around here, the least she can do is be happy!If anyone has a right to be irritable, its me  Im working harder!What did I do so bad this time?I didnt do anything to deserve to be treated like this! I would venture to guess that most people who are married have had similar thoughts. I would also bet that people who have close relationships with someone who has bipolar disorder have these thoughts much more frequently. Our partners, I think, may be so busy fighting their own inner demons that they have little time or energy to give us the positive strokes we expect to get for all we do. If my partners irritability continues much longer, I have a tendency to lash out. Somehow, frustration and anger always seem to find a way to express themselves. These negative emotions and expressions, however, simply feed the problem and further raise the level of stress and conflict. The worse I treat my partner, the worse her moods become, and if this goes on long enough and intensifies, it almost always leads to my partner experiencing a major mood episode. And if we thought we werent getting along before, now were in a real mess. The reason I write about this, is that I feel the need to be honest about how bipolar disorder affects me as a loved one and to show that even the guy who co-authored a book on bipolar disorder can have a tough time dealing with it. People with bipolar disorder often lack the insight to recognize when theyre slipping into mania or depression. Sometimes, I think loved ones can lack that insight, too  we miss the early warning signs and become part of the problem rather than part of the solution. Hopefully, someone reading this may learn something from my mistakes. 
 In this 9-minute video posted in January, Tom Wootton explains the three stages of bipolar disorder: Crisis, Managed, and Recovery. Video description: The current standard of care as defined by the National Institute of Mental Health is to minimize symptoms and accept the high probability of relapse. While many tools have been developed to effectively manage bipolar disorder, there are far too many people who are still living on the edge of relapse and suffering greatly from it. Even for those who achieve a level of remission that is commonly called recovery, they live in constant fear that one sleepless night can send them into another crisis. Trapped in a vicious cycle of Crisis, Managed, Recovery, and Relapse is the very definition of bipolar disorder and its depressive counterpart unipolar disorder. Even in Recovery, the illness is lurking behind every thought, waiting for the slightest chance to trigger a new episode. It consigns its victims to a lifetime of fear and constant vigilance in an attempt to keep the flow of energy and information at bay. It is interesting that so many people have a different word than "recovery" for the state where we are limited to the comfort zone of no high or low symptoms. They do not call it "recovery," they call it "bored." It is one of the major reasons that they slip back into the Managed Stage and risk another Crisis. This is why the National Institute of Mental Health says, "in spite of modern, evidence-based treatment, bipolar disorder remains a highly recurrent, predominantly depressive illness." 
 High and Low Social Energy: The Real Polar in Bipolar? by John McManamy Monday, July 2, 2007 Ive been doing a lot of sleeping the past several days. One reason is that my entire holistic mind-body connection is demanding time-out after a nine-month period that has involved a new book, a marriage break-up, a cross-country shift in residence, a major international award, a busy travel schedule that has included public speaking, and a singularly productive writing stretch, not to mention a virtual gabfest of neurons cooking up a list of things for me to do for the next three or four hundred years. But the proximate cause of my current malaise is last weeks NAMI annual convention. As I mentioned in an earlier blog, introvert is my default setting, together with low-grade chronic depression, introspection, and some social anxiety. But I also perk up around people and can become enviably hypomanic. At NAMI, I was animated and highly engaged, but at the cost of draining my psychic battery. By the time I returned home, the power light was off. Several years ago, I polled my Newsletter readers. I asked them take an online Myers-Briggs and email me the results, along with their diagnosis. It turned out that 83 percent of us were introverts, an almost exact reverse of the general population. Keep in mind that we bipolars are depressed way more than we are manic. These results are pretty much in line with surveys conducted at the University of North Carolina. Particularly revealing was that 17 percent of us tested INFJ and 14 percent INFP, the mystics and dreamers, respectively, the true social oddballs of the world that together comprise but two percent of the general population. The only category of extravert over-represented in my poll were the ENFJs, the visionaries (think Einstein) who would fit right in with us mystics and dreamers (Im a card-carrying INFP). The world owes us an eternal debt of gratitude for coming up with fire, literature, the Sistine Chapel, and E=MC2, not to mention the didgeridoo and iPhone and other cool things. In return, our neighbors show their appreciation by treating us as outsiders. Fitting in doesnt come easy. We use up a lot of energy trying to get along. Jung was onto this when he came up with the concept of introvert and extravert. The terms dont necessarily relate to feeling shy or being outgoing. Rather, they are about our sense of energy renewal or energy depletion in being around people or being alone. In addition, our illness adds layers of complications. I see it all the time in support groups  people who turn up at seven barely able to breathe and at nine are ready to give the rest of us salsa lessons. This may account for the true polarity in bipolar. The combination of introversion and a mood disorder, not to mention our oddball dispositions, can be deadly. We have the tendency to destructively isolate, which invites depression in. Then, when depressed, we tend not to reach out, which can send us spiraling further down. Often, we do need to take a time-out, and there are some interesting theories that hibernation and depression may be biologically connected. But we also need to be mindful of the fact that the times we most want to stay inside the house may be the times we most need to be outside the house. But I am also learning that the reverse applies. Even when I am the life of the party, I need to be aware that my mind is engaged in an energy-consuming tug of war with my underlying natural introversion. Basically, my little Energizer bunny doesnt just keep going and going and going. Perhaps our natural introversion is what saves a lot of us from cycling up into mania. Our motor thankfully runs down before we can get into too much trouble. If were smart, we gracefully poop out and go home. Far too many of us, however, resort to artificial power supplies in the form of street drugs and caffeine. Or we foolishly fight off sleep, which is the royal road to a manic episode. Our compensatory poop-out mechanism may overshoot us into depression. Keep in mind bipolar depression is generally different from unipolar depression. The unipolars tend to veer toward melancholic and sad. We bipolars lean toward anergic and leaden. The unipolars tend to sleep too little while we bipolars cant get out of bed. The unipolars dont want to eat. We bipolars, on the other hand, crave quick-energy sugars and carbs. This may explain why SSRIs generally dont work for bipolar depression. Our listlessness and lack of motivation point to a dopamine depletion rather than a lack of serotonin. Forget about mood, for the time being. What really seems to be happening is we have shifted from too much energy to too little. Thankfully, my schedule allows for a few extra days of time-out, and Im in the perfect location up here in the mountains to stop and smell the sage. I am not depressed, and thats the point. Im not pushing my luck. In another day or two, I will be back to full-strength. But there will be situations that will call for me doing the very opposite, for getting out amongst people when I would rather curl up in bed. I need the wisdom to make the right call. I cant wait for the experts to come up with definitive answers. I have to figure this out right now. Thankfully, my present state of low social energy puts me in the perfect headspace for some serious introspecting. Now that I am aware of the sliders on the control panel, it wont take me long to make the right adjustments. Be smart. Know thyself. Live well  
 The Positive Side of Bipolar By Elizabeth Forbes Bipolar Magazine Excerpt from the Winter 2012 issue: In the decade since she was diagnosed with bipolar I, musician Sara L. has developed some ideas about what might be called the upside of the illness. “This is just my own kind of pet theory,” explains Sara, 39, “that it confers personality characteristics … drive, ambition, energy, enthusiasm and self-confidence. And when you’re well, those things come across in a positive, pro-social way.” Of course, Sara knows all about the “life-trashing” side of bipolar. As a punk rocker with dark moods, she spent her 20s overindulging in alcohol and marijuana. When she rebounded from a deep depression into extreme mania after a romantic breakup, symptoms like religious delusions, incoherent speech and agitation landed her in the hospital. With medication to smooth out her mood swings and talk therapy to defuse the distorted thinking of depression, she’s able to see some pluses to having bipolar. “Research is showing that there are links between creativity and bipolar disorder,” explains Sara, who is now studying for a master's in counseling psychology. “I think it remains to be seen exactly if or how, but in my own life I’ve always been a creative spirit. Or maybe not so much that bipolar causes a creative mind—it may, but it’s more that it gives you drive and ambition.” That combination of creativity and drive helped Sara make her mark as a singer-songwriter, recording and touring with her indie-pop band Vancouver Nights and a well-received project called the Gay. She still performs with her band and other musicians occasionally, but facing off against bipolar has given her a new passion: helping other people with mental illness. She’s developed the view that “it’s a belief about having bipolar disorder that really can make or break our ability to live well. I think when people get the message that, ‘Oh, this is a chronic illness and you better just hunker down and try to get through life, and you’re going to be very limited in what you can do’—people internalize that message,” she says. “I think it’s still a struggle day-to-day with everyone who has bipolar because of the moods … so it takes vigilance and it does take resilience,” Sara adds. “And I guess part of that is acknowledging the positive things it’s brought to you.” helpful traits While it may sound surprising to put “bipolar” and “positive” in the same sentence, an analysis published in the Journal of Affective Disorders in February 2011 found that having bipolar disorder may enhance “certain specific psychological characteristics … that are generally viewed as valuable and beneficial morally or socially.” The authors reviewed 81 studies that noted positive characteristics in patients with bipolar and found a strong association with five qualities: spirituality, empathy, creativity, realism, and resilience. Nassir Ghaemi, MD, MPH, and colleagues from Tufts Medical Center in Boston concluded that encouraging an appreciation of the positive aspects of bipolar could help combat stigma and improve patient outcomes. Ghaemi, a psychiatrist who directs the Mood Disorders Program at Tufts, went a step further in his recent book A First-Rate Madness: Uncovering the Links between Leadership and Mental Illness. The widely publicized book argues that because leaders with depression or bipolar disorder have stronger qualities of empathy, realism, creativity and resilience, they are better equipped for times of crisis. “Depression enhances empathy and realism and the mania enhances creativity and resilience … so when people have bipolar disorder, they have the full gamut of benefits,” says Ghaemi. By contrast, research into “positive cognitive bias” shows that people without a mental illness tend to overestimate both their own capabilities and their control over the environment, as well as interpret events with an overly optimistic lens. During a crisis, Ghaemi says, it’s better to be able to assess situations more clearly—thanks to a trait researchers have identified as “depressive realism”—and have the greater flexibility of mind and higher tolerance for risk that go along with hypomania. In his book, Ghaemi notes that his thesis upends the commonly held assumption that mental illness is “inherently bad.” He does distinguish, however, between mild symptoms that can be helpful and severe symptoms that lead to dysfunction. Ghaemi says A First-Rate Madness was inspired by patients with bipolar who are quite successful in business and politics. Since discussing those people would violate patient confidentiality, “historical leaders is a way for me to bring out those examples in a way that is publicly accessible to people.” better with bp? While Ghaemi’s thesis has some detractors, he is not alone in finding advantages to having bipolar. Most notably, Kay Redfield Jamison has championed creativity (in Touched With Fire) and a passion for life (in Exuberance) as positive hallmarks of bipolar disorder. In his 2005 book The Hypomanic Edge: The Link Between (A Little) Craziness and (A Lot of) Success in America, clinical psychologist John D. Gartner, PhD, argues that a mild form of mania has fueled American innovation. Gartner links relatively high rates of bipolar disorder in the United States to a gene pool heavily weighted with immigrants. The idea is that many immigrants made the leap to a new country thanks to hypomanic traits such as entrepreneurial drive, a high tolerance for risk-taking, creative vision and brash self-confidence. In individuals who don’t cycle into mood swings this is known as a hyperthymic temperament, and it is found disproportionately in relatives of people who have full-blown bipolar. Self-help coach and author Tom Wootton drew on personal experience to develop his “bipolar advantage” approach, which mirrors much of Ghaemi’s thinking. By accepting and wisely managing the illness, Wootton teaches, an individual with bipolar can harness elements of hypomania such as enhanced creativity and productivity. Depressive introspection can yield deeper awareness and insights. And emotional pain can be a catalyst for personal growth. Steve B. of Colorado Springs, Colorado, was especially struck when he read Wootton’s books. He relates Wootton’s message to a remark made by a successful friend with bipolar. “My friend, who is a published author, said a lot of the reason we can do what we do is not necessarily in spite of [having bipolar], it’s because of,” explains Steve, 54, a licensed insurance agent who founded a statewide organization of the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA). For example, Steve says, “If I’m in kind of an arrogant mood, I’ll just go to somebody and I’ll say, look, don’t mess with me because I can out-think you and I can out-talk you. There’s times when the racing thoughts and the tangential thinking and the pressured speech can get you into a lot of trouble, but also it can help you sell things—that’s my background, sales and customer service—and be able to problem- solve. “If you leverage it properly and don’t go overboard, it’s amazing the things you can do.” Steve believes that traits associated with his bipolar I helped him create and run the nonprofit BrainStorm Career Services for Psychiatric Disability, a subsidiary of DBSA Colorado Inc., while holding down a day job. “The leadership qualities, I think, have always been there,” says Steve, a longtime community organizer and former district chairman for the El Paso County Democratic Party. “But when I figured out why it is I act the way I do, and when I got past the real dysfunctional behaviors, yes, [bipolar] absolutely has fueled and accelerated the leadership stuff.” … SIDEBAR: a method in his ‘Madness’ “In the storm of crisis, complete sanity can steer us astray, while some insanity brings us to port.” In A First-Rate Madness, Nassir Ghaemi, MD, MPH, brings psychiatric analysis to bear on historical figures (plus a few modern-day leaders) to demonstrate that premise. Ghaemi backs up his argument with a wide body of research that makes for interesting reading. He shows that depressive pessimism links to a more realistic assessment of circumstances, that the “divergent thinking” of hypomania enhances creative problem-solving, and that aspects of depression and bipolar disorder increase resilience. Thus Winston Churchill, whose well-documented deep depressions and energized moods indicate bipolar II, became a pre-eminent leader during World War II. He was realistic about the threat Hitler posed, perceived that war was required, and rallied the nation to endure hard times just as he had survived bleak periods. His predecessor, Neville Chamberlain, is condemned for appeasing Hitler. In truth, Ghaemi says, Chamberlain was hampered by the unrealistic optimism and attachment to the status quo characteristic of average mental health. Ghaemi convincingly explains that the mercurial Civil War Gen. William T. Sherman invented the “total war” philosophy, destroying a swath of the South because he saw the harsh necessity. Franklin Roosevelt, who exhibited persistent hypomania, was willing to experiment with new programs during the Great Depression. Ted Turner, however, fared poorly in a corporate setting because his bipolar traits were better suited to entrepreneurial pursuits like creating CNN. We can’t all lead a country through turmoil, but it makes sense to find a role that plays to bipolar strengths. 
 Accepting the diagnosis by Donna Jackel, BP Magazine At age 29, Julie C. seemed to be at an enviable place in life. She had good friends. She had come out as a lesbian and was comfortable with her sexuality. And she had a fulfilling job that took her to far-off places: She was coordinator of the Toronto-based Stephen Lewis Foundation’s Grandmothers to Grandmothers Campaign, which supports African women who care for grandchildren orphaned by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. That life began to slip away from her in 2007, when she was beset by money and relationship problems. Julie became suicidal, was hospitalized twice, and treated for depression. But her psychologist knew another side of the young woman—the high-energy, high achiever who could sometimes work at a furious pace with little sleep. In 2008, the psychologist told Julie that she believed she had bipolar disorder. “I was terrified at first,” Julie recalls months later. “I had this dropping feeling in my gut. All the stereotypes I had about [bipolar] came flooding into my head. I have a friend who is bipolar and she has been almost homeless a couple of times, and in and out of hospital. I thought, ‘Oh my God—is this what my life is going to be?’” Julie, now 31, has accepted her diagnosis. She is stable and feels much better than in the past. She takes her medication daily, maintains a regular sleep schedule, works out, and has improved her eating habits. She still works for the Stephen Lewis Foundation, but is planning to move back to her hometown and work long-distance. For others, the road to acceptance can be long and circuitous. Peggy M., 38, of Burlington, Wisconsin, has experienced highs and lows since her teens. Although Peggy was diagnosed with bipolar in 2002, acceptance did not come until six years later when she had her first negative work evaluation. Peggy received a poor rating in several areas; the comment that hurt most was “poor communication skills.” “I have a master’s degree in communications. [The review] was a direct contradiction to what I knew about myself,” Peggy says. “That’s when I finally had to admit it was the bipolar affecting my work.” Many factors influence how well a consumer is able to adapt to bipolar. These include the severity of the illness, level of self-awareness, one’s attitude about mental illness, availability of a support system, and access to quality health care. Some consumers are able to accept their illness after one or two manic episodes. Others remain in denial for years, burning through relationships, jobs, and money until they hit rock bottom. “Bipolar is one of the illnesses people have the hardest time accepting,” says Sagar V. Parikh, MD, deputy psychiatrist-in-chief at the University Health Network in Toronto and professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto. “Maybe one- third accept [the diagnosis] right away. At least a third totally reject it, and a third believe it, but when they are better for a while, begin to doubt it again.” “It’s common for acceptance to take years,” agrees Evette J. Ludman, PhD, a clinical psychologist and researcher at Group Health Cooperative in Seattle and coauthor of Overcoming Bipolar Disorder: A Comprehensive Workbook for Managing Your Symptoms and Achieving Your Life Goals (New Harbinger Publications, 2009). Fully accepting the diagnosis is “almost like joining the priesthood,” Parikh says. “The commitment to treatment is a major one that involves going to the doctor regularly and paying a lot of effort to regulating one’s lifestyle. It’s not just a commitment to medication, but a way of life.” In his research, Parikh found that consumers with bipolar II have greater difficulty acknowledging the diagnosis than do those with bipolar I, which is typically characterized by clear-cut episodes of mania and depression. The symptoms of bipolar II are subtle, he explains, making it difficult to perceive the hypomania as a symptom of the illness, rather than part of one’s identity. “Your highs are mild, your brain is working faster, you have more confidence and energy, you need less sleep—it’s the ideal human condition,” says Parikh. Because the symptoms of bipolar II tend to be sporadic, “it is difficult to conceptualize it as an illness,” he adds. In his 20 years as a Methodist minister, Ron M. encountered people with bipolar disorder—there was the female parishioner who had threatened him with a knife, and the wild young man who had stripped off all his clothes. Because Ron associated the illness with such extreme behavior, he missed his own symptoms when they began in early 2003. He attributed his racing thoughts, restlessness, auditory hallucinations, and crying jags to depression. His behavior resulted in Ron being placed on disability leave by his denomination; he began seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist and started taking an antidepressant. Eight months later, Ron was diagnosed with bipolar II and prescribed a mood-stabilizer. He continued to tell himself he was “only” suffering from depression, however. “I was convinced that if I could tough it out, I’d be fine,” he says. “I told myself, ‘There is no way I’m bipolar.’” During this period, his marriage of 20 years ended. Looking back, Ron says it was this denial that prevented him from getting adequate treatment. Despite his skepticism, Ron began reading about bipolar disorder and keeping a mood chart. By the summer of 2004, he had accepted his diagnosis. “The research indicated that my moods and cycling were pretty consistent with the disease,” he says. Since this breakthrough, life has “gotten a lot easier,” Ron says. He is more open-minded about taking medication. And by continuing to chart his moods, he can predict the ups and downs. “I will have five to seven good days and then I will crash and have about seven to 10 dark days,” he says. “You can almost set your watch by my cycling.” Meanwhile, a series of changes have enriched Ron’s life. He moved from St. Louis to Tucson to be near family and friends; medication adjustments have brought him greater wellness, and last January he fell in love and remarried. “When I grieve for how my life used to be, I remind myself that if it was like it used to be, I would never have met her,” he says of his wife. Because of his rapid-cycling, Ron, now 52, does not believe he will be able to lead a congregation again. However, he finds great fulfillment helping others as president of the Tucson DBSA (Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance) chapter. “I force myself to go to meetings when I’m not feeling good,” he says, “And when I am feeling good, I need to go so I can share with someone to help them in their time of struggling.” Indeed, the stigma and discrimination associated with mental illness is a huge barrier in coming to terms with bipolar, consumers and experts agree. It is because there are so many misconceptions and preconceptions about mental illness that Ludman, the Seattle psychologist and researcher, hesitates using phrases like “accepting the diagnosis.” “I’m not very fond of labels,” she explains. “Everyone has their own story of what ‘accepting’ [the illness] means. It may mean ‘I’m crazy,’ or ‘No one loves me.’” Jo R., an executive assistant for an Atlanta-based optometry association, resisted her 1997 diagnosis for eight years. To her, bipolar disorder meant that she could no longer trust her own mind. “After 36 years of living, I couldn’t think my thoughts were incorrect,” says Jo, who grew up in poverty in the small hamlet of Jasper, Florida. “I was intelligent and had accomplished a lot, so I couldn’t be crazy.” Jo told herself that her sleeplessness and psychoses were side effects of her antidepressant. Denial cost her deeply: She lost two jobs, resulting in bankruptcy and the loss of her home. But it was not until she spent a week in a state mental hospital that the reality of her situation fully hit. “There was a beautiful woman there who yelled and barked like a dog; there was another girl who urinated on herself,” she says. “The people there were crazy, and I was among them, so I was one of them. I told the doctor, ‘I’m ready to do whatever I need to do to manage this.’ That’s when I accepted the diagnosis.” Jo, now 48, made good on her promise, learning all she could about bipolar and what she needed to do to stay well. Today, she works full time and has her own apartment. She keeps a mood chart and a journal, exercises, takes her medication, and avoids “toxic” people. Indeed, Jo is so vigilant about maintaining her down time and getting enough sleep that friends and family know not to call her after 9 p.m. She carefully tracks her spending, keeping to a strict budget and recording all her purchases. “The bipolar diagnosis has been a true blessing,” Jo now will tell you. “Being bipolar forces you to change to be the best you can be … to live a good life.” The first step following a diagnosis of bipolar—even before medication—should be learning about your illness, says Parikh. “It is the single most effective remedy aiding acceptance. You’re not going to follow any treatment plan unless it makes sense to you.” Mental health experts generally agree that accepting the diagnosis makes it easier to follow a treatment plan. Yet disagreement exists as to how to best approach patients who are in denial. Gary S. Sachs, MD, founder and director of the Bipolar Clinic and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, doesn’t “push acceptance as a requirement.” “Many patients will be willing to accept some form of intervention if I don’t require that they accept the label as well,” he says. “Ambivalence about treatment is kind of the norm,” agrees Mark S. Bauer, MD, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, director of the Harvard South Shore Psychiatry Residency Training Program, and a coauthor of Overcoming Bipolar Disorder. “Studies show that only 20 percent [of consumers] come to treatment fully on board,” he says. Rather than try to convince skeptical patients, Bauer teaches them how to recognize their mood swings, understand how episodes have affected their quality of life, and how to control these patterns. He also helps consumers “develop a detailed plan for living a full life, based on their values and core goals.” But others believe that accepting the diagnosis is integral to treating the illness effectively. “By accepting what the problem is and informing yourself about the disease and treatment, you are empowering yourself to control the disease,” says Francis M. Mondimore, MD, assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and author of Bipolar Disorder: A Guide for Patients and Families (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006).“My message to people is that we know a lot about how to treat this problem; how to manage the symptoms. You need to know all the options, so you can make an informed health-care decision. Once you’ve named something, you’ve got some control over it.” Lise E. of Northfield, Vermont, grew up around mental illness. Her father committed suicide when she was 17 and her late sister had schizoaffective disorder. “I was always in fear of being like my sister,” Lise admits. A librarian at Norwich University in Northfield, and the mother of three teenaged boys, Lise, 48, had for years been treated sporadically for depression. Then a 2003 car accident—a drunk driver totaled the car she and her family were riding in—heightened her depression. Her family doctor switched her antidepressant and before long Lise became manic. She left her husband and sons and moved into an apartment. A hospitalization and a diagnosis of bipolar II followed. “At first, I was just dealing with the ramifications of what I had done, and was kind of in shock—how could I lose sight of my kids and my family?” Then Lise had to learn to live with a new diagnosis. Instead of the more socially acceptable label of depression, she had a severe, chronic mood disorder. “It was scary and it made me sad,” she recalls. In fact, consumers often “get very caught up in whether symptoms indicate depression or bipolar,” says Mondimore. “What we’re learning about mood disorders is there is a lot of overlap. As time goes on, we probably won’t even have separate categories for depression and bipolar. Instead, there will be a classification for mood disorders.” Lise found that her family history actually strengthened her resolve to reclaim her life. “I lost my father to suicide and I will not do that to my kids, no matter how hard it is,” she says. “I go get help as soon as I feel those [suicidal] thoughts coming.” Medication adherence is the biggest roadblock to fully accepting bipolar disorder, according to Mondimore. “That is the hardest thing—admitting that you are not always able to control your emotional life,” he says. But these feelings subside with the support of loved ones and by undergoing psychotherapy, he adds. Side effects are a more tangible reason people refuse, or go off, psycho-tropic medication. For example, Jo had to learn to live with a 100-pound weight gain and hand tremors. For her part, Julie initially refused to take lithium because it was so heavily associated with bipolar disorder. “I had talked myself into thinking I had bp-light—that I had a very mild version of what other people had,” she says wryly. “Friends also told me not to take it—that I could manage without it.” But then Julie began cycling more noticeably. “One week I would be excited and the next I would think the world was ending,” she says. “My therapist said lithium would help that.” It can also be deeply frustrating to accept that medications can only manage, not cure bipolar, Ludman points out. The notion of having to take pills every day for the rest of her life intimidated Wendy L., 55, of Owensboro, Kentucky, who has “trouble doing anything routinely.” But there was a more basic reason Wendy at first resisted medication: “I liked my manic highs—I felt very productive. I didn’t want them taken away,” she says. After discussions with her husband, however, Wendy decided that for his sake she needed to stabilize her moods. “We’d been married for 30 years and I put my husband through hell those 30 years,” she says. Diagnosed at age 50, Wendy has gradually learned to live with “flat” moods. “I was used to flying high and feeling all these ranges of emotions and that wasn’t there anymore.” Missing the soaring highs and bursts of energy leads many to stop their medication and land back in the hospital. “It’s very common for patients to stop taking mood-stabilizing medication when they begin to feel better,” Ludman says. Sachs of Massachusetts General believes that having someone in your life to help you stay on track is so crucial for patients with bipolar that he helps those who don’t have an existing support system to develop one. “Mood disorders include periods when your perceptions are distorted, so the most important thing to include in your treatment plan is a care partner,” he says. Those fortunate enough to have a loved one willing to join them on the road to recovery travel a less lonely path. “My husband educated himself. We sat down, talked about the symptoms, signs, and different triggers that had happened over years,” says Wendy. “He was willing to work through the changes. He was so accepting of it that it helped me accept it.” You don’t have to be in a romantic relationship to find support—an understanding boss who lets you come to work a bit later because a new medication is making you sleepy; family and friends who visit you in the hospital; or a relative with bipolar who shares what worked for him—all can contribute to your wellness. Julie, who was living in a small town when she came out as a lesbian, believes society is more accepting of homosexuality than mental illness. “In my office, I don’t care if people know I’m gay,” she says. “The few co-workers who do know about my bipolar will be like, ‘So are your meds working now?’ as if I’ll get on some meds, and then I’ll be normal. That’s not going to be it—I’ll have to manage my illness—even when I’m well.” When Julie told her boss she had bipolar, the woman, who is also a good friend, responded: “You are still the same person. Nothing has changed, except that you know something about yourself that can make you feel better.” Donna Jackel is a Rochester, New York–based health writer whose work has also been featured in Gannett Newspapers, Bark Magazine, Rochester Magazine and Her Magazine. 
 When Was Your Last Bipolar Disorder Med Check? by Candida Fink, MD, Bipolar Beat June 23, 2011 When was the last time you saw your doctor for a med check? A month ago? Six months ago? A year or more? Getting regular med checks, which can vary from weekly to quarterly depending on the level of acuteness of your symptoms, is important for a number of reasons: If you were placed on medications to treat acute mania or depression and you’re feeling better now, your doctor may want to remove certain medications and/or decrease dosages to maintenance levels. You don’t want to be taking more medication than necessary. During a major manic episode, for example, doctors often prescribe a mood stabilizer, such as lithium, along with an atypical antipsychotic, such as Zyprexa, and then gradually withdraw the atypical antipsychotic as the patient improves.With certain medications, including lithium and Depakote, you should have your blood levels checked regularly – more frequently when first starting the medication. On medications such as atypical antipsychotics, you should be getting regular laboratory tests to assess your glucose metabolism and your lipids – i.e. cholesterol. On lithium, you need to have your thyroid function monitored. Depending on your medication combination a variety of blood tests may be important . If it’s been 3 or 4 months since you have had any labs done and your doctor doesn’t bring it up, be sure to ask her if it might be time to check some blood tests. A “med check” sounds like a drive-through check-in with your doctor, but it’s really much more than that. A number of issues should be checked and discussed as part of the foundation of long-term management of bipolar disorder. A number of medications require regular checking of your weight, and some psychiatric medications can affect blood pressure. If you’re on an atypical antipsychotic, the doctor will monitor for signs of weight gain and can help you discuss ways to address this early on if it starts to happen. Blood pressure problems can also be detected during these medication checks and may mean that a medication needs to be adjusted or changed.Medication checks give you a chance to talk to your doctor about side effects and possible ways to reduce or eliminate them. This lessens the likelihood that you’ll get frustrated with a side effect and just stop taking your medication. Regular discussions to address problems with the medicine improve outcomes and help to manage and/or reduce side effects.Some doctors tend to layer on medications without removing others. If you’re taking five or six different medications or two medications in the same class, such as two antidepressants or two antipsychotics, you may be taking unnecessary medications. In a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry Online, Dr. John O. Brooks, III, and colleagues discovered that “Patients with bipolar disorder treated with more than one second-generation antipsychotic drug do not do any better than those treated with one drug, and only have worse side effects.” Regular medication checks allow you and your doctor to review your medications and determine whether tapering or eliminating some redundant medicines is appropriate.Medication visits are an opportunity to discuss non-medication issues, such as nutrition and sleep/wake cycles and other medical issues that affect your illness and your medication.Regular medication checks are important in building a working relationship with your doctor and for both of you to be monitoring your patterns of symptoms, responses to medications, and side effects. Your doctor will be better able to help you if she knows you well and has gotten to know some of the patterns and problems over time – before a crisis. Communication and regular monitoring help to prevent crises in the first place, and if a major problem crops up, it enables your doctor to step in sooner rather than later with up-to-date information to help manage things.Caution: Don’t stop taking a medication or adjust your medications without consulting your prescriber first. If it’s been more than three months since you had your last med check, we encourage you to make an appointment to see your prescriber. 
 Can Feeling Too Good Be Bad? Positive Emotion in Bipolar Disorder Association for Psychological Science July 21, 2011 Positive emotions like joy and compassion are good for your mental and physical health, and help foster creativity and friendship. But people with bipolar disorder seem to have too much of a good thing. In a new article to be published in the August issue of Current Directions in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, psychologist June Gruber of Yale University considers how positive emotion may become negative in bipolar disorder. One of the characteristics of bipolar disorder is the extreme periods of positive mood, or mania. People in the grip of mania also have increased energy, sleep less, and experience extreme self-confidence. At first glance, this may sound good and even desirable. However, during these times of mania, people with bipolar disorder often take dangerous risks, run up their credit card debt, and wreak havoc in marriages. “The fact that positive emotion has gone awry is something unique about bipolar disorder, as almost all other emotional disorders are characterized by difficulties in negative emotions” Gruber says. Gruber points out that positive emotions are problematic for people with bipolar disorder even when they’re not experiencing mania. Gruber has studied people whose bipolar disorder is in remission and found that they still experience more positive emotions than people who have never had bipolar disorder. More positive emotions may not sound like a bad thing, but there are times when these positive emotions aren’t appropriate. “In our work, those with bipolar disorder continue to report greater positive emotions whether it’s a positive film, very sad film clip of a child crying over his father’s death, and even disgusting films involving someone digging through feces” she says. In more recent work Gruber and her colleagues have found they still feel good even if a close romantic partner tells them something sad face to face, they still feel good. “It’s rose-colored glasses gone too far.” Clinical psychologists may also be able to use this research to figure out who with bipolar disorder is likely to relapse; people who have a lot of positive emotions, even at inappropriate times, may provide a window into possible early warning signs, Gruber says. In a study of healthy college students who had never been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, Gruber found that those who showed these same high levels of positive emotions that persisted across positive, negative and neutral situations were at higher risk for bipolar disorder. But not all emotions are alike in bipolar disorder; in fact, they seem to have particular kinds of positive emotions. They report feeling more achievement and self-focused emotions like pride and rewarding feelings like joy. They don’t differ social emotions that connect us with others, like love and compassion. “This mirrors early clinical observations and more recent scientific work,” Gruber says—that people with bipolar disorder set very high, ambitious goals, are sensitive to rewards, and in periods of mania, some believe they have special powers. Psychologists should also consider that there are downsides of positive emotions even for people who don’t have bipolar disorder, Gruber says. “Although positive emotions are generally good for us, when they take extreme forms or when they’re experienced in the wrong context, the benefits of positive emotion begin to unravel,” she says. The goal: “experience it in moderation, in the right place and time.”

 Pregnancy Planning for Women with Bipolar Disorder By Candida Fink, MD, Bipolar Beat Sept. 8, 2011 In a recent article published in Current Psychiatry Online, entitled Treating bipolar disorder during pregnancy, assistant clinical professors of psychiatry at Stanford University Mytilee Vemuri, MD, MBA and Katherine Williams, MD provide an excellent summary of the risks and benefits associated with bipolar disorder and its treatment during womens reproductive years, particularly during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Their article offers detailed information about the relative risks of the most commonly prescribed medications, and provides clear recommendations regarding working with young women with bipolar disorder before, during, and after pregnancy. Key Points Highlights for me were the following: The importance of having regular discussions about birth control and pregnancy risks with any woman of reproductive age being treated for bipolar disorder. Women with bipolar disorder have a higher risk of irregular menstrual cycles, as well as patterns of impulsive behavior as part of manic episodes, which increases the risks of unplanned pregnancies.The fact that some medications, such as Tegretol, can decrease the effectiveness of birth control pills.The fact that some medicines, including Lamotrigine, are less effective when combined with birth control pills.Pregnancy Planning Goals for a Woman Taking Medication for Bipolar Disorder Goals of planning a pregnancy for a woman on medications for bipolar disorder include the following: Stable mood for several months before conception.Lowest number of medications at the lowest possible doses.Avoiding certain medications that have the most well established risks of causing specific birth defects, if at all possible, is optimal. These medications include Depakote, Tegretol, and Lithium.Non medication interventions such as increased monitoring with the doctor and therapist, family involvement, and regulating sleep and stress levels are also very important.Planning for Postpartum and Breastfeeding In my practice I have seen several severe post-partum mood episodes  depressed, manic, and mixed. These can be very difficult to treat and present significant risks to mother and the newborn. Careful planning and monitoring are essential. Plans regarding possible breast feeding should be in place early on, including back up plans if there is an episode in postpartum and medications must be restarted or increased. A Valuable Resource I have saved this article to my reference file  it is full of key data points and practical guidance. If you are a young woman with bipolar disorder, I recommend that you read it now and file away a copy that you can pull up in the future if you are thinking about getting pregnant. It will be a valuable resource for you, your family, and your doctors. 
 I've had up and down moods since I was 14, I am now 18 my lows had always been the worst feature and they would last for about a week or two then I would have high moods for a few days however when they started they were very rapid and I could have two or three mood swings a year up until about 16 were they became weeks. Which had always been very pleasent I felt fantastic I had no sense of fear I would do anything I feel like and it felt like everything was happening for a reason. I didnt need to sleep and my body was feeling like it was electric I would stay up 21 or 22 hours a day and once stayed awake for 40 hours. However there had been down side such as on some highs my whole mission maybe to have sex and I have slept with a number of my male friends but then would compleatly regret and feel terribly guilty about it when I crashed. Recently though my high moods have started to take darker turns sometimes I've started to have audio hallucenations this can also happen on low mood. Also I've become very aggressive during highs, I am also not an aggressive person however on a high mood a attacked my father over the fact he wouldnt let me go out for a walk at 2 am in the morning and he had to restrain me till i calmed down. I am pretty sure that my high mood is a form of mania but I am not to sure. ---------- Post added at 07:05 PM ---------- Previous post was at 06:24 PM ---------- **I could have two or three mood swings a day up until 16. 
 I saw my p/doc a few weeks ago and he wanted me to add risperidone to my lithium. I told him I was happy and wasn't going to try and change that because I have been having lots of fun and acomplishing a lot. Long story short, it kept escalating until I was very manic, flipping out on people and was starting to hallucinate (don't ask what LOL )...anyways then my mom tried to call the cops on me when we were in an arguement because I kept hitting stuff and shoved her. I didn't let her...at some point I was thinking how overwhelmed I was feeling and started taking the risperidone. I really helped a lot, even made me sleep but...it made my neck cramp up so I quit taking it. I also had started taking more lithium a few days before the risp. So thankgoodness the edge has been taken off my manic high, my thoughs still race, I'm still hyper but uncoordinated now, I feel overwhelmed at times, people in public think I'm a crackhead,...etc but its getting better slowly. I am wondering...lack of sleep and stress triggers 99% of my episodes...I can tell from my journal...so like is there something I could take to chill out BEFORE the mania sets in, like if something stresses me out real bad and/or I can't sleep...is there something I could just take to chill so the trigger won't affect me. Not take everyday but you know what I mean. Does that work or do I need another mood stabilizer? CL 
 I'm just wondering because I've been noticing over the past year or so, my husband has been experience some manic signs when he gets overly stressed. I already know that anxiety can trigger insomnia and irritibility, but besides those symptoms, I've noticed that he has forced speech during these episodes. Being bipolar myself, I already know what it's like. He tells me his mind is racing so fast that his tongue can't keep up, gets tongue-tied, and takes the long, roundabout way in talking and explaining things. Sometimes even talks too much when he gets like this. He's never been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but has been diagnosed with dysthymia/anxiety issues in the past. But even though he has the racing thoughts/forced speech, he still goes through the self loathing at the same time. So I don't know if these are some kind of mixed episodes, or if anxiety in itself can cause some manic symptoms in an otherwise non-bipolar person. I know he needs to see a doctor about this, but he's uninsured and we're broke. 
 Surviving Bipolar Depression by Russ Federman, Ph.D., ABPP, Psychology Today July 24, 2011 Essential elements of surviving bipolar depression The symptoms of bipolar disorder that most grab our attention are the elevated mood states of hypomania and mania. The impulsivity, high energy, rapid speech and euphoria of someone experiencing elevated mood are far more unusual or aberrant than pessimism, low energy and low self-esteem of depressed mood. So it may be surprising to learn that for those with bipolar disorder, particularly bipolar II, upwards of two thirds of experience is located on the depressive end of the bipolar continuum. Essentially, depression is pretty common for people with bipolar disorder. Typically, bipolar depression isn't any different from what we might think of as garden-variety depression. Exceptions entail those instances where we see agitated depression or depression with strong irritability. These symptoms are low frequency but do reflect the unique mixed mood state where depressed mood blends with more intense energy.Yet for most that are bipolar, depression is mostly depression. Anergic, gloomy and painful. The depressed person sees the world through a set of lenses or a filter that makes it difficult to access positive thoughts. Optimism and hope give way to pessimism. Energy feels depleted. The motivation to do and to manage one's life is replaced with lethargy and ennui. Essentially one turns inward and disengages from the external world. Perceptions of self are also strongly affected. Most who are depressed experience low self-esteem. When filled with negative perceptions of self, it becomes equally difficult to imagine that others would find one to be likable or desirable. The world feels like a crappy place and ones psychic house becomes a painful and inhospitable residence. Sometimes depression is precipitated by external events that cause painful emotions: rejection by a lover, career-related disappointment or financial insufficiency. And then there are other times when depression just sort of creeps into ones psyche, like invasive weeds.Its not that anything specifically is wrong on the outside.Its more like your sense of resiliency and optimism has lost its foothold. Your progression forward has transitioned to a gradual slide downward. If theres any brightness in this bleak experience its that depressed mood is usually transient. Most people who experience depression arent depressed forever. In fact, when depression occurs as a function of situational stressors, it usually resolves once the situation improves. The rejected lover finds a new relationship. The individual with a stagnating career finds a new job. And even for those who seem to be stuck in a depressive rut that has no clear or obvious explanation, there is still hope for treatment-related improvement. Good psychotherapy can yield change; so can the right antidepressant, regular exercise, good sleep and generally healthy living. But this equation doesnt necessarily apply to those with bipolar disorder because they face a unique risk that most with unipolar depression do not; that is, the medications most often prescribed for moderate to severe depression, antidepressants, can precipitate rapid progression towards hypomania and mania. In this regard they can be dangerous, like trying to smother a smoldering fire with dry sawdust. Just add enough oxygen and youve got much more than you bargained for. And the psychiatric alternatives? Well, mostly they are the mood stabilizers as well as the few atypical antipsychotic medications that have been approved for adjunctive use in the treatment of depression. Sometimes these combinations can be effective. But there are many other times when depressed bipolar individuals dont feel adequately helped by their medication. Their escape from depression feels blocked and their helpers, the psychiatrists and psychotherapists, seem only to be offering snake oil remedies. At least so things can seem through a set of depressed lenses. When bipolar depression sets in there are two elements essential for change and improvement: these are willfulness and patience. A close cousin of willfulness is intentionality and both need to be applied to get moving. Unfortunately, from the middle of depression, the thought of exercise may seem as doable as defying gravity. Despite the enormity of the endeavor, getting there is as basic as putting one foot in front of another while moving towards the gym, the track, the exercise bike, the Bowflex or the swimming pool. And once there, you do it, regardless of how difficult or pleasure-less the experience may be. Put differently, when youre overtaken by inertia you must try to get yourself moving; and you try, and you try and you keep trying until movement happens. There are many other aspects of movement and activation that are similarly applicable: moving out of bed and out of the house; moving towards your to do list; moving towards improved self-care; moving towards support and professional help; and beginning to move towards change, even when your depressed lenses filter out such options. Granted, when motivation is depleted, these can seem like monumental feats, but they truly do make a difference. Lets also look at this notion of patience. An analogy we can all relate to is the experience of being sick with a really bad cold or possibly even the flu. Think of how miserable you feel the second day into your virus. If you thought the same experience would continue indefinitely, it would feel intolerable. Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness would wrap around your experience of a sore throat, fever and body aches. Thats exactly what happens with depressed mood. Now feels like forever, but its not. Depression will end as certainly as mood variability is the essence of bipolar illness. Such needs to be written on the eyelids of people with bipolar depression. Let there be no illusion that living through bipolar depression is easy. The depressive end of the bipolar continuum can feel really awful.And whats worse is that its a place you may visit many times over the years. But despite this awfulness youve got to hold on to the reality that your depression is not here to stay. You can endure. And when your depressed lenses make this all look like a bunch of inspirational garbage, then youve also got the benefit of rationality to help you recognize that your take on reality may not always be accurate. With sufficient commitment your willfulness and your patience will help you survive the darkness while moving towards something better.

 Watching Out for Summer Mania! by Julie A. Fast, Bipolar Disorder Magazine blog Watch out for these summer mania triggers: Extra sunshine (such as staying at a park or beach all day)Weddings (including your own)Any travel at all, especially to a new time zoneGraduation (for yourself or your children)Visitors to your homeJuly 4 (this is often a boisterous, all-day event with a lot of stimulation)Summer activities such as water sports or baseballSummer break from schoolPreventing mania takes a lot of self-awareness, especially in summer when it’s so nice to feel good again. Have you ever noticed that your mood is better in the summer? This makes sense when you consider that mood swings often run in cycles, depending on the natural light where you live. “For many people who have bipolar disorder, too much light exposure can provoke mania and too little can lead to depression,” says John Preston, MD, coauthor of our book and psychopharmacology expert in the treatment of bipolar disorder who teaches at Alliant International University, Sacramento Campus. “This is why hospitalizations for mania peak in the summer, and for depression [they peak] in the late fall. “It’s certainly tempting to spend more time outside in the summer, so one must make a focused effort to keep bright light exposure at about the same amount of time per day, year round,” adds Dr. Preston. “What matters is the amount of bright light entering the eye, which has been shown to have a significant impact on brain chemistry…so sunglasses help.” Even though it helps to read a reasonable explanation about why we often get manic in the summer, it’s still hard to take it seriously. After all, summer feels so good. However, this good feeling is often the result of mania and therefore has to be monitored carefully. Mania is so tricky—it can sneak up on you in just a few hours. Before you know it, you’re staying up all night for a week (at the expense of your job and relationships), working on a project you just know will change the world. Meanwhile, everyone around you is asking, “What the heck is wrong with you? Have you lost your mind?” There are two types of mania, depending on whether you have bipolar I or bipolar II. The basic difference between the two diagnoses is that people with bipolar I experience full-blown mania, while those with bipolar II experience hypomania. If not detected early, full-blown mania gets out of hand very quickly and often requires hospitalization. Hypomanic mood swings, on the other hand, can go undetected for years, which is why people with bipolar II are often diagnosed much later in life than are those with bipolar I. The number one sign of full-blown mania is when you sleep a lot less, but have plenty of energy. It’s especially important that you look for mania symptoms if you have a winter depression that suddenly lifts once there is more light outdoors. People with hypomania have more difficulty recognizing the signs they’re manic than do those with full-blown mania. Rapid speech and over socializing are often signs of hypomania. The more you know about your particular form of mania, the easier it will be to notice the first signs that you need help. I know: It stinks to have to get help when you’re finally feeling good again, but mania is simply the flip side of depression and needs to be treated just as aggressively. The best defense against summer mania is prevention. This, of course, starts with medications. But as you may already know, while medications are invaluable at preventing the large mood swings, many people with bipolar disorder still have to deal with the smaller manias that slip through the medications and create disasters. There is also the problem of going off medications because you start to feel good and your brain tells you you’re not really sick anymore. This is really easy to do when it’s so nice and sunny outside. You often feel so much better and you think: It’s finally over! No more bipolar disorder for me! I’m cured! And yet, just as depression creates false feelings of despair and hopelessness, mania creates the false feelings that we are fine and no longer need medications. The treatment window for mania is much less than that for depression, which is why mania must be prevented, instead of merely treated when it happens to show up. If you have even one thought that you “don’t really need those medications any more,” this is a time to talk with your doctor. I don’t know about you, but I find it a real burden to have to look for mania every time I start to feel good. It’s the reality of this disorder however, and I’ve found there are certain things I say, think, and do every single time I begin to get manic. By learning these signs, writing them down, and then teaching my friends and family to recognize them as well, I’ve finally gotten more control over my mania. You can do the same. Here is a short version of my list: What I say: Do you think I’m manic?I don’t think I’m manic!This weather is so fantastic!I am so happy to finally feel better!I’m not manic. I’m just not depressed.Leave me alone! You just want to ruin my fun!I’m normal! This is the real me!What I think: Am I finally better?Is this the real me?Was the diagnosis wrong?What I do: Go out every night.Drink a lot more.Talk a lot faster.Join groups or take classes. Meet new people like crazy.Stop eating good food, or hardly eat at all. Sleep less.I always try to evaluate myself as soon as I have the first thought that I might be manic. You can do the same. Ask yourself the following questions: Have I stopped my medications because I feel better? Have I conveniently decided not to tell anyone about doing this? Am I sleeping a lot less than normal and not feeling tired at all? Am I more irritated with people than usual? Am I using drugs or alcohol without thinking of what they’re doing to my brain? Was I depressed in the winter and now feel a lot better? Are things getting done really easily? Have I stopped eating or taking care of the people in my life? Have I become selfish? Has anyone expressed concern about my behavior? If you answer yes to any one of these questions, it may be time to talk with your doctor about mania. I’ve had too many summer manic disasters and they took a lot of recovery time. I don’t want to go through it again this summer. If you’re well enough to read this article and see mild signs of mania, you have time to prevent a serious mood swing that could land you in the hospital, or cause you to make decisions you will regret. Do now what it takes to protect yourself, your family, your finances, and your life. You will thank me (and especially yourself) when the next winter comes around. ----- Julie A.

 I;m sorry i keep posting so mcuh, i just have a lot of questions and thoguhts going through my head. I know ive posted a lot, i apologize. I was dxed wth bipolar disorder, borderline personality and social anxiety disorder when I was like 19 or 20, and later with ptsd. i have a pretty easy time accepting the borderline and ptsd but ive always questioned the bipolar and now im questiooning the social anxiety disorder too. i guess the only "manic" times i REMEMBER are from early on. thats another thing, my whole life memory is really bad. i get like flashes of memories from childhood and from my teenage years. nothing really substancial or meaty as far as remembering those times of my life, but enough t o know cetian things. most of those memories are really bad ones too but there are some that are i guess you would say normal. however, from the last 10 years my memories are STILL not really concrete. I was hospitalized over 25 times during the past 10 years, and a lot of other things went with it, but it iis still really hazy as far as memories go. i cant even remember what i did yesterday or earlier in the day most of the time. i dont know whats wrong with me. i understand not remembering childhood, but as an adult i should be able to reemember things, u know? anyway, back to bipolar... what "manic" things i DO remember are a few things, like there was a time i thought i was the second coming of Christ...that I fit all those attrubutes that the Bible talks about, and that I was so unique, that I was him. another time i spent over $200 on shampoo and chewing gum to donate to the state mental hospital that i had just been discharged from, antoher time i spent $900 on dishes. one time i cleaned out my moms basement (whhiich was piled top to bottom with 20 years of crap, and i did it in a day and a half without resting and then proceeded to have a garage sale the next day, but thats all i really remember, i dont know if those are really manic though. sometimes my thoughts race so fast and are so loud that they just come tumbling out of my mouth and i start just talking tomyself and talking back adn forth to myself like im having a conversation with myself, but i get those racing thoughts when im really depressed too. i dont know what else. but my point is that none of that has happened in so long and im wondering if it was something else and not mania. ive always had a hard time accepting the bipolar dx. once when i was hospitalized i remember telling the psychiatrist about how i like become a boy almost like i had said in another post, and he dced me with schizoeffective disorder. i never believed that was true though. ive also been dxed with somekinf of disassociative disorder but i dont remember what it was called. but the psychologist that made that dx freaked me out big time, so i never went back and never told any of my other professionals that she had said that dx.. also. when i was in the state hospital. the psychiatist said i mainly was dealing wtih borderline and he had run a borderline clinic at his previous job so he knew what he was tlaking about. he said i should have never been taken to the state hospital because of that dx, but i wouldnt sign the admission paoers at the local psych hospital. i never rememeber being asked to sign myself in though, but i had just taken a big OD of klonopin so maybe i dont remember.. back to the bipolar though. i KNOW ive been extremely depressed--i don;t question that, but i seemed to be like that all the time. however, at times its much more severe. so i don't know if i really believe the bipolar dx and im afraid to talk to the psychiatrist about it becasue im on disability and i believe its based on the bipolar. i cant loose my disability at this point in my life. i would be homeless, i just cant handle working right now, let alone leaving my home other then going to therapy and to buy some grocieries. another thing i quwstion is the soical anxiety disorder becasue i think i just really dont trust people and thats why i fear having people in my life and being in social situations. i dont know if its social anxiety disotder though, i just also get sick of people sometimes and disgusted with being around them. i have huge issues with proxcimity of other people. i can not handle touch from another people, it even makes me cringe when my skin touches another part of my skin. but i dont think any of that is social phbia. overall my point is that im really confused about myself and i feel like i want to just start over with new people sometimes and see if they can figure out whats wrong wtih me. if i wasnt soooo attached to my therapist i would do that i think. does anyone have any insight or anythihing at all that could help me? sorry to write so much 
 Criteria Changes for Bipolar Disorder Proposed for DSM-5 by Deborah Brauser, Medscape Medical News June 17, 2011 The upcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), may include revisions for diagnosing mixed episodes while keeping the current duration criteria for hypomanic episodes in bipolar disorders, according to 2 presentations by members of the DSM-5 Mood Disorders Work Group at the 9th International Conference on Bipolar Disorder (ICBD). Clinicians frequently refer to episodes of bipolar illness as "mixed" when in fact these episodes infrequently meet the criteria listed in the DSM, Fourth Edition (DSM-4).As a result, the Work Group is now proposing the addition of a mixed specifier to the new manual. "This would allow the clinician to indicate the presence of 2 to 3 manic or hypomanic symptoms occurring for at least 2 to 3 days simultaneously with a fully syndromal episode of depression," Ellen Frank, PhD, distinguished professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in Pennsylvania, told ICBD delegates. She added that these manic/hypomanic symptoms "would be limited to those that do not have the potential for overlap with the symptoms of depression." Dr. Frank told Medscape Medical News that the Work Group wants the criteria to better reflect clinical practice. "In the DSM-5, we've tried to make the criteria for mixed episodes conform to how clinicians actually use that terminology. The criteria, as previously listed, rarely existed in the real world," she said. More Realistic Criteria Mixed episode criteria described in the DSM-4 includes the simultaneous presence of a fully manic and a fully depressive syndrome nearly every day during at a minimum a 1-week period. However, she said, the full criteria are too restrictive and often not present. "From my perspective, it's a lovely idea but just like I have never seen a unicorn, I don't think I have ever seen a patient in my 30 years of working in bipolar disorder who simultaneously met all those criteria," said Dr. Frank. "So for the DSM-5, we set out to elaborate a set of criteria that are more consistent with the way in which the term 'mixed episode' is used  and more consistent with what is found in clinical epidemiologic studies." The proposed mixed specifier would apply to episodes of both depression and mania. Dr. Frank added that the criteria will not be limited to bipolar disorder but could be applied to episodes of depression experienced by patients with a lifetime diagnosis of a unipolar or bipolar disorder. Symptom Markers She explained that the specifier would be used if full criteria are met for a manic or hypomanic episode with at least 3 of the following depressive symptoms occurring concurrently nearly every day during the episode: Subjective depression;Worry;Self-reproach/guilt;Negative evaluation of self;Hopelessness;Suicidal ideation or behavior;Anhedonia;Fatigue; orPsychomotor retardation.It would also be used if full criteria are met for a major depressive episode with at least 3 of the following concurrent hypomanic symptoms: Elevated mood;Decreased need for sleep;Goal-directed activity;Increased energy and visible hyperactivity;Grandiosity;Accelerated speech; orRacing thoughts.Symptoms that are characteristic of both depression and mania are not included in the new mixed specifier, including distractibility, irritability, insomnia, or indecisiveness. Risks of Incorrect Use Dr. Frank noted that the consequences of incorrectly using the current mixed episode definitions include an underestimation of suicide risk, inappropriate treatment selection, and a failure to identify those at an increased risk of progressing from unipolar disorder to bipolar disorder. "I think we're talking not simply about something that we conceptualize from our rating scales but something that is very pronounced in the lives of patients. And we hope that this proposed revision to the DSM-5 will fit better with the reality." The Work Group is also recommending that the DSM-4's 4-day requirement for a diagnosis of a hypomanic episode be retained. "The appropriate and best definition for the duration of symptoms used to define hypomanic episodes has been long debated with passionate proponents on all sides of the discussion," said Trish Suppes, MD, from Stanford University School of Medicine in Palo Alto, California, and the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System during the second presentation. She noted that although the 4-day duration has been questioned vigorously, "review of the existing literature does not necessarily clarify the impact of changing the duration requirement." So the recommendation to keep the current duration essentially preserves the diagnostic criteria for bipolar II disorder. However, the committee is proposing that bipolar disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) will now include specified and coded subcategories, including those specifically designed to discuss patients who have shorter durations of hypomania (of 2 to 3 days). "We're suggesting that the NOS be divided into 3 broad categories: subsyndromal, other specified, and unspecified due to insufficient information." Activity as Important as Mood The committee is also recommending the addition of "activity or energy" to the Criterion A section of the Manual. "This is based on many studies supporting that activity or energy is as important as mood. This was implicit in the DSM-4 but it was important to make it explicit in the DSM-5 to heighten clarity that this is a core symptom of mania and hypomania." The activity inclusion will now specify "a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy." The symptom lists, as shown in Criterion B, will essentially not be changed. "Many of these revisions are an effort to capture more clearly what our patients experience and to provide an opportunity to study in a more focused manner the full spectrum of mood disorders," said Dr. Suppes. "We're basically working towards a new classification system, with new codes and new billable options, and I think it's likely that out of this, new [Food and Drug Administration] targets for drug development will emerge." 9th International Conference on Bipolar Disorder (ICBD): Symposium 2, # 6 and 7.

 Nutritional Factors in Bipolar Disorder Often Overlooked By Candida Fink, MD, Bipolar Beat June 15, 2011 Researchers at Lewisham Counselling and Counsellor Associates in Britain performed a very small study to determine what impact, if any, diet and nutrition have on a person with bipolar disorder and the implications of this on psychotherapeutic practice. They presented their findings at the BACP (British Association for Counseling & Psychotherapy) Research Conference 2011. Heres what they found: A link does exist between diet and bipolar disorder. Omega 3, Magnesium, Vitamin B, and low sugar intake seemed helpful in minimizing the intensity and frequency of the mood swings.A sudden increase or decrease in appetite or erratic eating pattern is common at the onset of bipolar disorder.Bipolar treatments seldom consider diet, perhaps because of its perceived association with alternative medicine.The authors of the study suggest that including a dietitian or nutritionist on the treatment team might be a good idea. Unfortunately, its true that doctors and therapists often overlook nutrition as a possible contributing factor to bipolar disorders mood swings. Standard treatment protocols rely on medication and certain therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy  the industrial strength tools. But considering diet and nutrition is important, as we point out in Bipolar Disorder For Dummies and in a previous post entitled Good Mood Foods. This study was extremely small, and the structure of the study makes it hard to draw any big conclusions. But I have noted in my practice that appetite and diet are strongly correlated with mood states  and in once case a severely restricted diet was associated with the onset of a manic episode. I cant tell if the eating changes were caused by the brewing mood episode or if the dramatic change in diet triggered the mood episode  but they were clearly related to each other. We know that bipolar mood episodes are closely linked to regulatory systems such as sleep/wake, so it makes sense that the dietary system would be part of that loop as well. Food and nutrition are clearly linked to mood and include specific nutrients, such as Omega 3′s, patterns of eating related to emotional states, healthy eating as a part of overall well-being and long-term illness management, and the weight effects of medications used to treat mood disorders. Nutritional expertise and support would certainly make sense for many people living with mood disorders at different points in their treatment and recovery. What do you think? Do you think the medical profession tends to overlook nutrition when treating bipolar disorder? Whens the last time your family physician, p-doc, or therapist asked you about what you eat or recommended dietary changes to help in mood management? 
 Hi all. I am so very afraid. My mind is all over the place. Emotions & mind are raging, energy high but different than manic energy. Different than mixed episode. My mood swings usually last 5 to 7 days then have 2+ weeks of "normal". This is different. Started as mixed episode for almost a week then morphed. Meanwhile, for weeks I've been seeing or hearing things that aren't there, patterns of faces in popcorn textured ceiling, seeing the shapes of animals formed by trees, hearing a voice in my head making a comment occasionally. Sometimes, but rare it's audible. I hear radio or tv playing in a far off room that's not there--the house is quiet or it's different than what my husband has on in the living room. I want to be alone but it feels different than the bipolar swing desire for isolation. Over the past year, I've had bipolar swings and have learned to face them and deal with them and function on a normal level--sometimes irritable, sometimes depressed inside, but functioning normally. Sometimes my hubby can't even tell--I've acquired good skills. What is scary is the intense focus and control that I learned over the past year isn't enough for this new *thing*. THIS IS DIFFERENT & I'm TERRIFIED. I can't control it. The anxiety can't be touched by even 1.5 mg of Clonazepam. I'm very sensitive to meds--it should have taken me down. Didn't touch this. I had strange ideas and delusions, hallucinations of various types intermittently since childhood--never told anyone. I lied about most of the questions when sent for a psych assessment in 2007 when my MD realized something was wrong (maybe depression). The diagnosis was depression because I admitted to being sad and wanting isolation, etc. Later, mood swings grew intense, thus the bipolar dx. Nearly all meds and combinations failed. Two that worked caused terrible TD & a bad case of gastritis & esophogitis--my regular MD forbid me to take them anymore. My Pdoc gave me Saphris to take when I feel my skills might not be enough--I was going to try it for this different wierd episode but my cardiologist was horrified and forbid it--so now my Pdoc & cardiologist are having a serious discussion about what I can & can't take. Meanwhile, I'm having trouble convincing myself to hang on. It's taking all my strength to try to care anymore. If the Saphris might kill me I wouldn't be afraid--having a stroke and being trapped with a sick mind in a broken body would be a living nightmare. I'd take it if the risk was just possible death and no stroke. I had one stroke last year and thank God there were no residual damages. So now, I'm experiencing hallucinations of different types more often and a rage where I want to break and destroy things. Sometimes I hate being around people. I never liked conversation a whole lot, unless in a very rare happy hypomanic state. I usually find it hard to make conversation but I've forced myself to try. I tell myself terrible things like "you must die!" I see visions of drowning myself in our pool. I see my Psychiatrist on Wed. 6/15 and I'm afraid of what he might tell me--that it is more than bipolar. Schizoaffective?? What should I do? What should I say? How should I organize my thoughts on paper to discuss with him in a manner that he will find helpful? I am terrified. Does anyone know what might be happening--any advice on how to approach my doctor? 
 Bipolar Disorder: Blame the Illness, Not the Person By Joe Kraynak, Bipolar Beat May 3, 2011 The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) has a Stages of Emotional Responses chart that traces the emotional path people generally travel in coming to terms with their loved ones mental illness. Im pretty much at the final stage, Stage III: Moving into Advocacy, but Im still sort of stuck at Stage II: Learning to Cope, which is characterized by Anger/Guilt/Resentment, Recognition and Grief. Yes, weve been living with bipolar disorder for about 12 years now, and Im still angry and resentful. Now, though, Im not angry at my wife who has bipolar disorder. I blame bipolar disorder. It accosted my wife, tried to ruin our marriage, emotionally traumatized our children, ruined my wifes career, and stole tens of thousands of dollars. I also carry some of that Stage II guilt. I wonder why I didnt give the love of my life the benefit of the doubt. Why did I assume she had turned on me of her own volition? Why didnt I question what was going on to make her act and speak that way? I blame that on bipolar disorder, too. Bipolar tends to sneak up on you. When it finally reveals itself, its dramatic, but its progression can be subtle. It tends to lead you to falsely believe that youre just having normal relationship issues  nothing that a little marriage or family counseling cant clear up. The take-away lesson is this: Blame the illness, not the person. Furthermore: Blame the problem, not the person. Certainly, thats easier said than done. When a loved one is in attack mode, we naturally tend to see that person as the attacker. Its tough to view her as merely the instrument of the real, unseen force. We need to look beyond the surface reality were dealing with to see that its the bipolar talking, the bipolar acting out. When we can see the illness as the underlying problem, we can start doing two things to turn the situation around: Stop making it worse. Blaming the person leads to confrontation, which only worsens the situation. We pour emotional fuel on a fire thats already blazing. When we blame the illness, we take some of the negative emotion out of the equation.Start making it better. When we recognize that bipolar disorder is an illness, we immediately know the solution  medical intervention. Obtaining that intervention when the disorder resists it and finding effective medications that have tolerable side effects are often very difficult challenges, but at least we know what were up against. 
 I was wondering if it's normal for bipolar people to have an "off" circadian cycle. I am just not a morning person, no matter what I do. It's been that way for me since I can remember, but seems to get worse with age. I can barely function or think until at least 1 or 2 in the afternoon, and my best time of day is between 6 and 10 pm. Making myself go to bed early just doesn't work. Is it just me? 
 Hi All, I've posted on these forums for some time now - mostly on the OCD forum. I've been keeping good track of my moods over the past 6 months and I can see a DEFINITE pattern. I'll feel just fine for about 6 weeks, with some minor OCD - but generally I feel very good and "normal". So much so that I don't even visit these forums. This is followed by another 4-6 weeks of feeling very crummy: Highly Increased OCD, Anxiety and depression. These moods cycle throughout the day from being tolerable to terrible. Generally, during these periods, I feel like my life is a mess. This has been happening for two years now. I'm still taking 100mg of Luvox and .5mg of Risperidone. I take ativan PRN, but don't even touch it during my "good" cycles. I have not been able to get in to see a psychiatrist in my area as none of them are taking new patients. My Family Doctor has referred me to CAMH in Toronto, but its a 4-6 month waiting list. My Dr. has screened me for Bipolar, but i don't have any of the disruptive "highs" associated with it. I've been reading lots about cyclothymia lately and was thinking that perhaps I may fall into this category. Is there anything else I can do to assess if this may be the correct diagnosis? I've read the mood stablizers such as Lamotrigine can help a great deal with cyclothymia and want to suggest a trial of this to my family doc. Any suggestions? 
 Cyclothymia - Overlooked and Misunderstood Marcia Purse Sunday, February 27, 2011 In the Questions and Answers section of BipolarConnect on HealthCentral, Angst asked a very good question: There are tons of articles and books and information available for bipolar disorder. Bipolar I and II are mentioned abundantly, yet cyclothymic disorder usually only gets a few sentences, a paragraph. It is very distressing and demeaning for someone with this disorder as it feels like it is just brushed off and unimportant. Angst is right: Cyclothymia, or cyclothymic disorder, is often overlooked and, by those who have heard of it, very frequently misunderstood. Let's get this straight right at the beginning: Cyclothymia is not "mild bipolar disorder." Yes, it is less severe than bipolar I or bipolar II disorder, but there is nothing "mild" about it. Hypomania in bipolar 2 disorder and cyclothymia are the same. That means people with cyclothymic disorder may spend recklessly, indulge in all the potentially damaging behaviors of hypersexuality, be unable to focus on a single subject for very long, have racing thoughts, behave inappropriately, be unusually irritable or aggressive, and have many other symptoms that go into the makeup of hypomania. The difference between cyclothymia and bipolar II is in the severity of depression symptoms. The DSM-V diagnostic criteria for cyclothymic disorder are as follows (emphasis mine): "For at least 2 years, the presence of numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms ... and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a Major Depressive Episode." So what's the difference between cyclothymic depression and a major depressive episode? Less than you might think: it is that a person with cyclothymia does not have thoughts of suicide and is never completely incapacitated by depression. Thus depression can still be quite severe in cyclothymia. Just as in bipolar disorders, both hypomanic and depressive symptoms of cyclothymia must "cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning." That's a serious condition. Given this, I'll go out on a limb here and say it's possible that cyclothymia may often be misdiagnosed as bipolar II disorder. Also, in some references cyclothymic disorder is called "bipolar III disorder." Maybe people with cyclothymia would get more respect if they called it bipolar III instead? 
 PMDD vs. Bipolar Found a few interesting pieces on the Internet likening PMDD (for those who don't know, that's severe PMS) to Bipolar Disorder. Some say that PMDD is often misdiagnosed as Bipolar - although, medically treated rather differently. It affects about 2% of the population (of women obviously...) - similar stat to bipolar. Anyone have any personal experiences in this? Is it possible to have both (God love the husbands of these women!). 
 What Does Mania and Hypomania Look Like? by Therese Borchard, Beyond Blue Friday February 25, 2011 On Beyond Blue, I focus predominantly on the problem of depression, because 99 percent of the time that's what I am struggling with, and I figure you, too. However, I think it's very important to discuss mania and hypomania because they can be just as, if not, more damaging to your health as depression. The reason why bipolar disorder sometimes takes up to 10 years to be diagnosed correctly is because no one complains to a doctor that she has more energy than usual, is super efficient at work, and for some reason doesn't need to look at her self-esteem file to feel okay! I mean, seriously, we want those symptoms to last ... forever ... if we can swing it. So the primary doc or the psychiatrist only gets the depression part, not knowing that it's the bloody cycling that's the problem. Those of you who have experienced mania or hypomania know why they are dangerous: what goes up must eventually come down, and the higher you are, the more severe the drop into the pit. Like having too much to drink, you know you're going to eventually pay for it - you just hope the payment isn't going to be too painful. It's tough for folks like me to initially recognize their hypomanias because the symptoms are subtle and not listed in the DSM-V under hypomania or mania. For example, I don't go on compulsive shopping sprees because I hate shopping, and always have. I don't sleep around because I'm on Zoloft (among other reasons like a great husband whom I would never want to hurt). Hypomania usually takes a bad habit and multiplies it by, say 100. So, in my case, it's the verbal diarrhea that's hazardous and raises the ominous red flag. I have no idea what's going to come out of my mouth when I open it, and too often I push "send" when I should press "delete." Under the best of circumstances I operate with a very thin filter from the brain to the mouth. That is one reason I gave up drinking before I graduated from high school. So when I feel a little high, my very thin filter goes bye bye and I either start apologizing all the time or I wear a sign around my neck that says, "I apologize if I say something inappropriate." The good news is that I'm getting better at knowing what triggers my hypomanias--and communicating any upswings with my doctor so she knows that I'm cycling. Lack of sleep will always do it. The four days before I was laid off, when I knew I would be laid off but didn't know how or for what reason, I averaged like four or five hours of sleep--when I require seven or eight to function properly. I was fretting over small details like how I was going to feed my family if my consulting gig got flushed down the toilet. By day five I could tell I was high, and I got even higher when I reconnected with a favorite professor from college who is helping me on a project that I am excited about, for which I've already written 64 drafts. One reason (among many) that I miss my former Beliefnet editor, Holly, is that she acted as my filter, and would tell me we were going to "hold off for awhile" on publishing a post when she suspected I was manic. One time she wrote me a detailed note listing all the reasons why she thought I might be hypomanic. It's still in my doctor's file, gets referenced all the time to determine if I'm doing the same sorts of things: in essence, biting off way more than I chew. Having been at this thing - bipolar disorder - for five years, I also know I have to do to bring myself down, as much as I'd love to stay up. If I can, I disconnect from all social networking and emailing because they tend to keep me in manic mode, and it's better to not have an opportunity to say the wrong thing. I try to be more steadfast in my meditation ... if I can. (Meditating is a tad difficult when you're manic.) I try to ground myself in prayer. I exercise as much as humanly possible, because I figure that working out is a far better channel of energy when I'm manic than engaging in a dialogue with someone who doesn't get me or why it's so hard to keep my mouth shut. Finally, I go easy on myself. I try not to beat myself up for all the inappropriate comments I've made when I was high. I remember my favorite line from Kay Redfield Jamison: "Tumultuousness, if coupled with discipline and a cool mind, is not such a bad sort of thing. That unless one wants to live a stunningly boring life, one ought to be on good terms with one's darker side and one's darker energies." 
 It seems that I experience two states of being, apart from those times which are my 'normal'. 1) a depressed state, or 2) a mixed depressive hypomanic state. These 2 are my predominant states. Is this typical of a bipolar? I do know what a pure manic state is, but I don't have many of them. They tend to be mixed with fury, irritability, road rage, intense suicidal ideation, etc. 
 Do You Have Seasonal Bipolar Disorder? By Candida Fink, MD January 25, 2011 According to an article by Debra-Lynn B. Hook entitled How SAD Affects Bipolar Disorder, as many as 20 percent of people with bipolar disorder can expect to experience seasonal depression and/or mania or hypomania. The article distinguishes between those who experience seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and seasonal bipolar disorder. Hook describes several treatment options for dealing with this seasonal component, including using light therapy in the winter and melatonin to help regulate circadian rhythms. I was somewhat surprised that only 20 percent of people with bipolar report a connection between mood and seasonal changes. Have you noticed a connection? What do you do, if anything, to maintain mood stability as the seasons change? 
 A Fresh Perspective on Bipolar Disorder by Dr. Dan Bochner It's a matter of intensity! It's really as simple as that. Bipolar disorder has many faces, and gets involved in so many other mental health issues, that it often seems quite complicated. Individuals with personality disorders are frequently very intense, and they often end up being given the bipolar diagnosis. Individuals who become psychotic (which means they lose touch with reality) often do so partially because of their intensity. Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between the impulsiveness involved in hyperactivity, autism or post-traumatic stress disorder, or even mental retardation, and the impulsiveness related to bipolar disorder. The fact is that moodiness and intensity are so often a part of other diagnoses that understanding bipolar disorder, and understanding how bipolar disorder can be a part of other diagnoses, is necessary in understanding psychopathology itself. A person's intensity affects how they react to everything they experience. The stronger a person's feelings are, the harder it is for that person to modulate those feelings. The bipolar can feel intensely depressed, intensely nervous, intensely excited, or intensely angry. Sadness becomes overwhelming rumination, anxiety becomes panic, and anger becomes rage. Feeling good becomes a flood of intricate, but often loosely connected, brilliant ideas, or a desire to save the world, or the feeling that one can fly. The best way to think about the intensity of the bipolar individual is to understand that the reptilian part of their brain is far too powerful. Neuroscience suggests that the lower parts of the human brain appear to be just like those of lower animals. That part of the brain handles automatic functioning and is largely based on the animal's need to stay protected and find sustenance. When a reptile fears a predator it has to ready itself for fleeing, fighting or freezing. When a reptile feels hunger it has to find something to eat. The higher brain, or cortex, modulates the lower parts of the brain. We use our understanding of things to mitigate the strength of the lower brain. However, the reptilian brain can have such intensity that it overwhelms the cortex. Or, conversely, the cortex can be underdeveloped in some ways, limiting the extent to which it sufficiently modulates the intensity of the lower brain. In bipolar disorder, the intensity of the lower brain is not adequately modulated which makes the bipolar behave at times like a T-Rex, vicious and starving, and at other times like a frightened little rabbit, jittery and afraid. If one can express an experience in terms of hunger and satiation on one hand, or fear and self-protection on the other, then it's an experience that will express itself intensely, behaviorally speaking, in the actions of the bipolar. Individuals with bipolar disorder are known to buy impulsively, as if their hunger for material possessions can't be sated. Similarly they often desire sexual activity and find themselves unable to control their passions regardless of the consequences. Anyone with bipolar disorder has had problems in controlling what they want. They react to what they want as though they need it desperately. They often want it right now, and they have a hard time really differentiating wants from needs. With respect to their hunger for things, or affection, or control, or any other kind of desire, the bipolar behaves as if they have been starved for years and will perish immediately unless sustenance can be found (please see article, The Power and Control Addiction). Likewise, the bipolar reacts to threats of any kind in extremely exaggerated ways. If they're cut off on the road, the bipolar may go into a “road rage.” Alternatively, they might develop a phobia to driving or to the area on the road where they were cut off. When it comes to interpersonal threats, the bipolar reacts with venom and aggression or with desperate fear. Where your average person might get miffed at a friend and decide to say nothing in spite of holding back some rankling emotions, the bipolar likely tries to cut the friend down to size and may just end up cutting off the friendship altogether. When in a dating situation, your average person might react to the ogling of one's partner with anger and an admonishment that it should never happen again, holding off judgment as to whether it might be a real problem. The bipolar is likely to slap or punch or verbally bash their date and/or the person who was ogled, thus requiring some kind of outside intervention, even if it's the first time it has happened. People with bipolar disorder often have problems in controlling the extent to which they feel threatened, and thus the extent to which they react to such threats. With respect to their need to protect themselves from competition with others, people bossing them around, the feeling that someone might be insulting them or might be trying to get one over on them, the bipolar behaves as if their very existence hangs in the balance. And if they do not bolt off or violently attack, they appear to feel like they might just be viciously torn limb from limb at any moment. Dominance and submission often become the theme where bipolar disorder is concerned. Even where most people would understand that everyone determines their own fate and that no one controls anyone else, someone with bipolar disorder is quite likely to behave as though they must end up on top or they might lose their very life. They are extremely sensitive to criticism, control, attitude, slights, being ignored, etc... all of which make them feel downed, and all of which are likely to result in aggression or severe anxiety or sadness, since the bipolar will likely feel they need to get back on top or risk being dominated by others. Even when someone with bipolar disorder experiences temptation or is having fun, they might move to dominate a situation with aggression so they can have what they want or prevent it from being controlled. If they can't have what they want or are prevented from their fun, the person with bipolar disorder can feel as though they might as well die since there is nothing left for which to live. Thus we see how some of the more serious personality disorders get confused with bipolar disorder. That is, these issues of intensity seem to affect those who have not developed the ability to soothe their own emotions, an ability which can only develop within a consistently loving and safe feeling family atmosphere. A person can have both a serious personality disorder and bipolar disorder since it is so common for bipolar parents to be untreated, and then provide inconsistently loving, dangerous feeling environments for their children. Of course, such children can also inherit bipolar disorder at a genetic level. When a person with bipolar disorder does not have a personality disorder, the two can be easily differentiated by the bipolar individual's tendency to take responsibility, and the regret they experience after impulsive acting out behavior occurs. These individuals can also be differentiated based on their description of their upbringing. If a person appears to describe a relatively consistent and regular home life from their childhood, but nevertheless exhibits extremely intense emotionality, they are most likely suffering from bipolar disorder as opposed to personality disorder. Overall, such individuals appear to be extremely intense in their reactions, but are also quite empathic and compassionate, which is not found in the more serious personality disorders. The psychological concept of “repression” is key here. When people are brought up in a relatively trusting and caring environment, they develop a sense of responsibility and depth of caring. Those attributes make a person deny the impulses they experience that are deemed to be threatening to their relationships. Threatening impulses, like aggressive, sexual, or even loving feelings, that would seem to be wrong or damaging to others in some way, are pushed downward and held inside. In the bipolar individual, these feelings become too intense and overcome repression. If the individual does not have a significant personality disorder, the tremendous guilt they experience after these behaviors have been exhibited is clearly palpable and often results in extreme depression. With serious personality disorders, guilt is only fleeting and serious depressions are more centrally located in a deflation of self-esteem, or hating one's self, than in guilt about what's been done. Repression and intensity are also involved in psychotic disorders. When repression is an especially powerful force, its failure in containing intensity is extremely dramatic, thus causing hallucinations (hearing and/or seeing things that are not there) and/or delusions (strong beliefs about what is happening that defy reasonable judgment), and the psychotic disorder will be thought of as more in the realm of Schizophrenia (a psychotic disorder in which hallucinations, delusions, and/or disorganized confusion occur without significant mood swings). When intensity is the primary issue, but repression fails because it has only developed to normal levels, the psychotic disorder is more in the realm of bipolar disorder. As many will observe, there is great overlap in the medicines used to treat each of these disorders. The overlap between these two disorders is significant because they both involve raw animal emotions filtered through, and morphed by, the desire to protect one's relationships. That is, repression aims to force down feelings, but sometimes those feelings are so powerful that they must be expressed. In order to make them less scary or damaging, repression changes these raw emotions into symbolic beliefs – hallucinations or delusions – that somehow represent the feelings pushing for expression. In psychotic disorders, both repression and intensity are powerful forces. But intensity is primary in the bipolar, while psychosis and the failure of overburdening repression are primary in the Schizophrenic. It can also be difficult to differentiate impulsiveness related to attention and concentration issues (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder - ADHD) from impulsiveness related to bipolar disorder. Again, one must be able to sense whether the problem is related to intensity, as would be the case with bipolar disorder, or if it is due to a need for stimulation, as is the case in ADHD. Unfortunately, the two overlap, just as they seem to in so many other disorders. People with bipolar disorder are often very sensation seeking because they experience powerful needs. Individuals with ADHD, however, are not filling a void, but rather are just trying to avoid boredom. The best way to tell the difference between the two is in the bipolar's ability to focus very intently on the things that interest them. In those with ADHD it is difficult to focus on anything for much time even if it's fascinating (unless it is also consistently stimulating, like television or video games). Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) also has significant overlap with bipolar disorder. In the pure case of PTSD a person who has been otherwise quite mentally healthy experiences a traumatic event. That event brings their safety into question and thus stirs up all the most severe emotions related to self-protection. Because those feelings become so intense, people with PTSD can become very aggressive and angry as well as withdrawn and avoidant. The intensity of those feelings becomes overwhelming to someone with PTSD and defies repression, similar to how it does in psychotic disorders. However, because the trauma is very real and the feelings associated are not merely a part of a person's unacceptable self (that is, their rawest emotions), hallucinations and delusions are not a typical part of the picture. That is, the very real emotions of trauma are not thought of as unacceptable aspects of the self because they derive from very real experience that was not within one's control. With PTSD, truly intense feelings are created, but the psychological problem that develops originates in the need to avoid the pain of the experience, which is quite difficult because the memories are extremely powerful and threatening. Avoidance of pain is primary with PTSD as opposed to the expression of intensity as in bipolar disorder. Even developmental delays involving mental retardation or autism can frequently be mixed with bipolar disorder. Individuals with developmental delays often experience, as part of their disorder, extreme sensitivities or irritability. They frequently become even more susceptible to their own impulses because they do not have the intellectual capacity and/or interpersonal confidence to mitigate the effect of their environment with thought or understanding of their past experiences. Although it is often obvious that the primary issue for such an individual is the developmental delay, the aspect of their disorder that makes them too intense, similar to all the other diagnoses mentioned above, will often be diagnosed as a “dual diagnosis” of bipolar disorder. Essentially bipolar disorder is a disorder of intensity. Because of that fact, bipolar disorder is often diagnosed within the same person as many other diagnoses. It can also be noticed that the same medications used to treat bipolar disorder are frequently prescribed when the primary diagnosis is in a different area, including personality disorder, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and even in developmental delays. The intensity of bipolar disorder can be likened to that of a reptile that knows only urgent fleeing from predators, fighting for life, and voraciously searching for food. To the bipolar, almost every experience can be interpreted in those terms. Thus, sensitivity to slights, or possible threats, or desires for all sorts of things, often lead to exaggerated intense reactions from the bipolar individual. There is, however, some good news!!! In helping people manage their intensity it can actually be helpful to liken their intensity to the emotional functioning of a reptile, just as described above in discussing the reptilian brain. Once any individual afflicted with inordinate intensity comes to understand that their reactivity is not reasonable or realistic, they can be motivated by their desire to be caring for loved one's to prevent their extreme reactions. They can learn to talk themselves down, excuse themselves from situations before they get too angry, assign friends or family to signal to them when they're showing signs of upset (please see article, Key Signals), take a medicine, or learn to breathe more deeply and rhythmically. Once one knows, and is willing to accept, that they have a hidden reptile inside them, and as soon as they are willing to accept that it can abruptly transform them into a T-Rex with little provocation, in the case of the true bipolar who genuinely cares deeply about loved one's, it is frequently the case that they will do whatever it takes to tame the primitive beast within. 
 I was diagnosed bipolar 2 back in April, after 30+ years . It was quite a relief to be finally off the emotional rollercoaster. I was sleeping normally, and emotionally stable. I am currently taking Seroquel 150mg before bedtime daily. No other medications. I am finding in the last few weeks that I am not sleeping again, like 2 or 3 hours at a time, wide awake during the day well into the small hours of the morning. I see my doctor next week, but I am wondering what I can do in the meantime to make sure I sleep. 
 Bipolar disorder with BPD marked by high aggression and impulsivity By Andrew Czyzewski, MedWire News 23 December 2010 Psychiatry Res 2010; Advance online publication Bipolar disorder patients with comorbid borderline personality disorder (BPD) show a heightened level of impulsivity and aggression as well as a markedly elevated rate of suicide attempts relative to those with bipolar disorder alone, study results show. The researchers say it is important to carry out a "comprehensive psychological evaluation" to screen for personality disorders in bipolar disorder. "The debate as to whether or not to include BPD among mood-spectrum disorders is far from being concluded due to the sharing of several clinical features, in particular, impulsiveness, aggressiveness, and affective lability, which may explain the acknowledged difficulties in differential diagnosis at times encountered by clinicians," say Bernardo Carpiniello (University of Cagliari, Italy) and colleagues. However, there have been no studies that have specifically evaluated the impact of BPD comorbidity on impulsivity and aggression in bipolar disorder patients. To address this, the researchers recruited a total of 57 patients with bipolar disorder in clinical stable remission, of whom 18 (31.6%) also had BPD and 11 (19.3%) had other personality disorders (OPD). They completed a structured clinical interview and were evaluated with the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) and the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ). Patients with bipolar disorder and comorbid BPD showed the highest level of impulsivity followed by bipolar disorder plus OPD, then bipolar disorder alone, with mean BIS scores of 78.94, 68.64, and 60.29, respectively, out of a maximum of 120. As reported in the journal of Psychiatry Research, a similar pattern was observed for aggression on the AQ scale with scores of 89.17, 73.55, and 69.96 for the respective diagnostic groups (maximum 116). This appeared to extend to self-aggression, the researchers note, as the rate of attempted suicides was approximately three times higher in bipolar disorder plus BPD patients compared with those with bipolar disorder alone and 7.6 times higher than in patients with bipolar disorder plus OPD. "Taken together, these results seem to demonstrate not only that impulsiveness and aggressiveness may be considered as 'traits' characterizing bipolar patients or BPD, but also that a higher level of these traits discriminate patients affected by bipolar disorder with BPD from 'pure' bipolar patients and from bipolar subjects with any OPD." Abstract 
 Hello, I am new to these forums and I would like some input on the current medications I am taking and possibly switching to new medications or adding on to what I am already prescribed. I have ADD and also have been newly diagnosed 8 months ago as being Bipolar II. The medications I am currently taking for Bipolar II are Lamotrigine at 175mg/day, Olanzapine (Zyprexa) at 10mg-15mg/day (taken in the evening) and Citalopram (an antidepressant) at a mere 10mg/day. My ADD meds are 1 54mg and 1 27mg of Concerta (81mg total) in the morning and 3 10mg tablets of Ritalin in the afternoon/evening. I find that the Lamotrigine is helping with my rapid-cycling. But the Olanzapine is where the problem is - I am oversleeping up to 10.5 hours a night and I always feel groggy and unmotivated the next day, also it has cause me to gain about 15 pounds. I don't like the side effects the Olanzapine has caused me and I would like to be weaned off of it. Despite the negative side effects I've mentioned, I do find however that Olanzapine does help me fall asleep, which is a good thing as I've always had trouble with that. Also, I am looking into an alternative medication aside from the Olanzapine as an add-on to my Lamotrigine. I've researched that Depakote may be an option but I am open to hear what has been effective for others with Bipolar II. As for going off the Olanzapine and having to go through not getting to sleep as well I've also heard that Clonazepam may be helpful for me to fall asleep for a short while (2-6 weeks). I've taken Zopiclone for a few weeks several months ago help me get to sleep but I realize that Zopiclone cannot be taken longer than a couple of weeks whereas Clonazepam may be taken for a longer period of time. Any feedback would be of great help to me, and I appreciate it. Many Thanks, Ginger 
 In this University of Virginia video, Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, psychiatry professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, shares her experiences with living every day with the mania and severe depression that she had studied for years. She talks openly of the challenges she faced with the treatment and disclosure of her mental illness. 
 I have had this condition for years, although only ever been told I suffer from depression. We left the UK about 4 years go and now live in a country which takes a very antiquated view of such conditions still calls these type of things insane and alike. All they do is heavy drugs and stuff people in a crazy house. So I am very reluctant to open my mouth as to my plight. My wife has quite a hard time with me, as I can often shout at her, as she does not understand my advanced thought process and how I connect the dots between things. And when I am on a roll she and the rest of the world appear to me to be a bunch thick idiots who know nothing. When I am down I just want to cry, I don’t know why often, or even wishing I was dead, as I hate this world so much, I cannot connect to it, it’s contradictory, cruel, and deceitful, which I hate. I often find I just cannot function within it. So, this is why we live in the middle of nowhere or at least minimal people, with my dogs the only good constant thing in my life. I have had more jobs than I can remember when I lived in the UK, all of which became boring and irritating to me. I constantly feel persecuted, and ridiculed by other as I see life very differently from them. All this seems to do is confirm my paranoia and derogatory opinions of most of humanity. I have not been on drugs now since we moved here, but in all honesty there are times I could do a good course of (out of it) type meds. I have even thought of moving back to the UK, in order to get the drugs I need, but I honestly could not take the stress of it all.

 Living a POSITIVE LIFE with Bipolar (Manic) Depression by Robin Kahler Sep 20th 2010 There should be a special award for husbands like mine. Thirty-six years of marriage to a woman with bi-polar disorder; not to mention current menopause. I was diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder on October 13, 1988. I also remember what I was doing on the day I heard that President Kennedy had been shot. And I usually remember my wedding anniversary. After that I tend to become a little bit like Edith Bunker, but the date of my diagnosis is forever etched into my memory. The spiral to hell began with a family outing to the Grand Canyon and ended with a half-frozen chicken. Our two teenage sons helped pack the family van with tents and fishing poles and we sang songs and reminisced as we drove the 650 miles; our first visit to the Grand Canyon. We arrived in time for a glorious sunset, set up our camp, enjoyed our meal, and slept well in the mountain air. The next morning I woke early and took a short hike to view the Grand Canyon up close. I stood at the very edge and looked straight down, about six-thousand feet down. Without reason or cause a black dark depression swept over me and I thought about stepping out and slipping over the edge. I moved forward to dangle one foot and I watched in fascination as the ground began to crumble a bit; pieces of dirt fell, plunged so deeply, beyond my view. No fear. Just dark depression, sadness. I was slightly surprised at the emotion because there was no reason for it's existence and yet it was there and very real. I looked up and out over the canyon and suddenly a beautiful large bird flew out over my head and dove deep, playing against the air near the cliffs, it soared. I watched as he folded his wings tightly against his body, he twisted, no longer bird-shaped, now like an arrow he plunged. His body fell quickly, plummeting a few hundred yards, spinning out-of-control, and then suddenly his wings spread out wide and bird-shaped again he soared back up above the canyon walls, then above me. He repeated his dangerous game several times and the thought came to me, "He can change his mind; you can't." At that moment I heard a footstep behind me and my husband's voice spoke, "Do you mind stepping back a bit, that edge could crumble you know." We went off on a hike and I remained silent about my experience. I never spoke about the deep depression that had suddenly overwhelmed me. That was the first step of mistakes. I had experienced some depression at times in the past, but those were times when everyone has normal lows; after the death of my grandmother, some postpartum depression, my doctor prescribed a few weeks of valium. There was an underlying sadness, my parents divorced when I was young and I hadn't spoken with my father in over twenty years. But in a strange way that seemed a blessing, my father was an odd sort. He never held a job longer than a few months. He often disappeared on fishing trips for weeks at a time. We sometimes went to bed hungry because he'd spent the grocery money on an elaborate toy train village at Christmas, or something else as frivolous. Of course I didn't know about bi-polar (manic) depression. I didn't know that sometimes it's inherited and my father's "odd" behavior were symptoms. I didn't know about that when the blackness swept over me at the Grand Canyon and I didn't know it a few weeks later when I faced the half-frozen chicken. Autumn had finally arrived to the Arizona desert and I thought it would be nice to have an oven meal. I planned a roast chicken dinner with stuffing, mashed potatoes, green beans. That morning I chopped the celery and onion, sauteed them in butter to a clear yet crisp transparency; a PERFECT meal, a beautiful day. I went to the refrigerator for the chicken I'd set out the night before. The thighs were still frozen. In a half of a milli-second my bright yellow kitchen turned dark and the blackness returned, my mind swirled with confusion. How would I stuff it? The thighs were frozen to the body. What would I do now? It would never roast, the meat would be raw. Confusion. Something that would normally not have bothered me at all, I knew how to soak the bird in a bowl of water, I knew the basic rules of cooking, but I didn't know about bi-polar depression. I didn't know why my world had suddenly crashed. I only knew that my dinner was ruined. My day way ruined. My life was horrible. What was I supposed to do with a stupid half-frozen chicken? Tears began to stream down my face and I plunged to the floor in a lotus position. I sat there with my legs crossed and that half-frozen chicken in my lap and I cried. I don't know how long I sat there, but my husband came home from work and found me there on the floor and he said, "Honey! What's wrong?! Did somebody die?!" I thought for a moment and suddenly I knew, deep down inside of myself, like a metaphysical moment, I felt that I knew the reason for my dark grief. Someone had died. But who? Who had died? A little voice spoke to me inside my head and I looked up at my husband and said sadly, "My father died." During the following weeks I relied on my new little voice to help with every decision I faced. My own mind was so overwhelmed that even reaching for a glass of water when I felt thirsty was now a task I couldn't complete. I'd sit and stare at a glass of water until my little voice told me to "Take a sip." My little voice told me which blouse to wear, "that blue one", when to go to bed, (I never slept) when to brush my teeth, and how to cook dinner. It also told me how my father died. My friends were fascinated with my story; my father was killed by enemy spies; for years he had been an undercover agent with the CIA and his code name was "Rhett Butler". I had to be careful now because the spies might be after me, I'd seen them in the shadows in the back yard. The hallucinations and stories continued for thirty days, thankfully now was the time when I had a follow-up visit with my family doctor. I had been prescribed a beta-blocker for my blood pressure, and it was time to see how the drug was working. My little voice was still giving me daily instructions for living and it told me to tell the doctor what was going on inside my head. I argued with it, "If I tell anyone about this they'll lock me away in a mental institution and I'll never see my family again!" I was terrified to tell anyone about my little voice. My voice explained to me that my doctor also had a little voice and he would understand and help me. So when my doctor entered the examining room and said, "Good Morning, Robin! How are you?" I calmly replied, "My little voice told me that your little voice would be able to help me." A few hours later I was talking with another doctor. A psychiatrist. After some conversation and a miserably failed attempt at a written test, she prescribed lithium. She also removed the beta blocker since that drug has a side effect known to cause hallucinations in some people. I told her about my Grand Canyon experience. She explained how lithium worked not as a tranquilizer and not as an anti-depressant, but as a mood stabilizer. In less than a week my little voice disappeared forever. Now I had to explain to my friends that I had no idea where my father was, there was no Rhett Butler code name, no CIA, and no spies were chasing me. I had to trust that they would understand, and they did. We laughed. We joked. We also sat in amazement that no one had recognized a very serious case of mental illness. Some of my friends were law enforcement officers, one was a medical transcriber, another was my pastor. None of them had recognized anything wrong. A full thirty days of hallucinations and mania! We all vowed to learn more about mental illness. That was twenty-three years ago. With the help of lithium I graduated from college on the Dean's List, planned my son's wedding, and assisted in the births of two of my grandchildren. I was the hospice caregiver to my mother when she was diagnosed with cancer. I planned her funeral. I reunited with my father. I planned his funeral when he passed with cancer. I made it through menopause without hormone treatments. I met my half brother and half sister who, it turned out, are also bi-polar. I learned that my father's grandmother committed suicide when she was 38 and two of her sons lived in deep depression in mental institutions for many years. Her other five sons were successful and apparently not affected.( I have another brother who is not affected with depression at all and so it can be but isn't always inherited.) Lithium didn't numb me. I felt grief when my parents died. But it wasn't that overwhelming end-of-the-world darkness. I felt joy when my sons married and when my grandchildren arrived, but I didn't go out and spend money we didn't have, or slip into an excited state of mania. Last year my kidneys began to reject the lithium. That sometimes happens with long-term lithium use. My doctors slowly removed it from my daily use and replaced it, for now, with something very mild. There are more choices on the market now and doctors and patients can decide which drugs are best for each individual. Lithium is still used successfully, as are other things. I was scared at first to go off of the lithium, I was afraid my little voice might return. I thought of Andrea Yates. But now I know the key is to not remain silent if anything happens. Communication with my doctor and my husband is vital. My family and friends are educated now and life is good. Life CAN be normal with bi-polar depression.

 Growing up bipolar: 'Nobody was on my side' By Elizabeth Landau, CNN August 30, 2010 Jennifer Konjoian was 10 years old when she put a plastic bag over her head. She remembers doing it impulsively, for no other reason than to get attention. For her mother, it was the last straw in a series of tantrums that led her to believe something was seriously wrong with Jennifer. After that incident, she took Jennifer to a psychiatric hospital. But that was far from the end of the journey for this mother and daughter to understand what was making Jennifer feel so frequently frustrated and overwhelmed by daily life situations at home. It took a second hospitalization at a different institution before she received medication that worked -- lithium -- for a diagnosis that seemed to fit: bipolar disorder. More bipolar kids, and younger Mental health professionals say that more and more children are receiving diagnoses of and treatment for bipolar disorder, and at younger ages. This is a serious brain disorder in which a person goes through extreme mood episodes of mania and depression, going from intense excitement and lack of focus to sadness and even suicidal behavior. A 2007 study in the Archives of General Psychiatry found that the number of office visits resulting in a diagnosis of bipolar disorder for those under 19 was 1,003 per 100,000 people in 2002-03 in the United States. This was a dramatic uptick from 25 per 100,000 people in 1994-95. "The prevalence of bipolar disorder in children in genuinely growing, but I think it's also because we are also becoming more aware that children who have very wild and very problematic mood swings may have bipolar disorder," said Dr. Rakesh Jain, a psychiatrist in Lake Jackson, Texas. But another reality that's not popular among parents is that sometimes, components of the child's environment contribute to these behavioral disturbances, said Dr. Charles Raison, psychiatrist at Emory University. There are, of course, children who genuinely have bipolar disorder, but he cautions that ideally, as a first line of defense, family support and therapy would be given to the child and problematic environments -- be it home or school -- would be improved, and then medication would be given as needed. "The problem is that's a bit of a pie-in-the-sky situation because most people don't have the money, don't have the access," he said. "On the other hand, there's certainly are going to be some kids that are so disruptive, so messed up and so bad, they probably need medication right away." Some kids, like many adults with mood disorders, do best with both psychotherapy and medication, said Raison, who has written about bipolar disorder on CNN.com. Toward a better diagnosis Although it is normal for children to throw minor fits when they don't get what they want, they are not moody by nature, and long-lasting tantrums may be indicative of bipolar disorder, Jain said. Because some symptoms of bipolar disorder resemble other conditions and there is not a lot of physician education about bipolar disorder in children, it is frequently misdiagnosed, Jain said. Jain admitted that earlier in his career, he frequently told young patients they had attention-deficit (hyperactivity) disorder or conduct disorder, when it became clear later that they were bipolar; he makes fewer of these mistakes now. Giving a child medication for the wrong psychiatric illness can have dangerous consequences, experts say. Muffy Walker, president of the International Bipolar Foundation, knows this firsthand: Her son had been taking antidepressants but had a full-blown manic episode at age 7. He talked about killing himself all the time; medication for bipolar disorder has helped him get back on track. There is large variation in individual response to psychiatric drugs, so there is always trial and error involved, notes Raison. It is rare for a child to show "classic" symptoms of adult bipolar disorder: rapidly changing mood swings and episodes of both depression and mania, Raison said. More often, children display nonspecific behavioral and emotional instability; they may or may not grow up to have full-blown bipolar disorder in adulthood, he said. That partly why some psychiatrists have proposed a new diagnosis for such kids for the forthcoming edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the bible of psychiatry. It's called Temper Dysregulation Disorder with Dysphoria, and it would include young children who have recurrent temper outbursts to common stressors. Since it's not an official diagnosis currently, it's not as mainstream a term as "bipolar." Konjoian had never heard of it but is now curious. Bipolar disorder, and medications for it, appeared to fit her daughter best out of the available options, but she's open to the idea that there's something more specific to describe Jennifer. The case of Jennifer Jennifer, the middle child, was always the most sensitive of Konjoian's three children, her mother said. She never had any episodes at school; they usually happened when she felt overwhelmed by her family: for instance, when her siblings picked on her. "I felt like nobody was on my side. That's kind of how I always felt," said Jennifer, now 17, of Andover, Massachusetts. "Rather than try to calm down and tell them how I feel, I would just show it through emotion: I would just cry or yell." Konjoian suspected that Jennifer needed medical attention at age 8, when she would cry for extended periods of time and get into moods very quickly. A pediatrician found nothing wrong with her. "I can't think straight, I guess, when I'm agitated. I just start yelling, or I start crying. You just can't think straight," Jennifer said. At a therapist's suggestion, Jennifer's parents agreed to put her on antidepressants since she seemed to be getting worse. The therapist mentioned that it could be bipolar disorder, but at the time Konjoian didn't believe it. Still, when things worsened, Konjoian agreed to antidepressants. Jennifer was off medication for third grade, but in fourth grade things got worse. She received more medication and therapy, but the combination didn't seem to be helping. "A couple of times, she would open the bathroom window on our second floor and stick her leg out and threaten to jump, and you knew that it was something that she didn't even know herself, because when I'd question her about it later, she didn't even remember it," Konjoian said. After her second hospitalization and lithium prescription at age 11, Jennifer improved markedly, both in her mother's estimation and in the way that she feels about situations that used to give her difficulty. "In certain things that would get me upset, rather than just going off in a temper tantrum, I'd be able to think about it more. I feel like it slowed me down a little bit and think more so I could stop it from escalating," she said. "Also, I matured." Is it possible to stop medication? For the past year, Jennifer has been off of all medications but still sees a therapist, and the family has a relationship with a psychiatrist in case of relapse. In general, people with bipolar disorder must stay on medication for life because relapses are common, said Raison, who has not treated Jennifer. But some are fine for periods of time without them, he said. Jain agreed that some patients who do well can go for stretches without medication, but he has never been able to completely remove a bipolar patient from drugs and say, "you're cured." Bipolar disorder should be viewed as a chronic illness like hypertension or diabetes, which require lifelong management, he said. It is wise for anyone who does go off medicine to continue to see a mental health professional and closely watch for symptoms of recurrence, Raison said. Jennifer and her mother are both active in speaking out about mental illness. Jennifer, a senior in high school, volunteers with Families for Depression Awareness.

 Dysfunctional beliefs specific to bipolar disorder identified By Liam Davenport, MedWire News 01 October 2009 J Affect Dis 2009; Advance online publication Remitted bipolar disorder patients have unique dysfunctional beliefs compared with unipolar patients and healthy individuals, say UK scientists who believe the findings could help the development of specific behavioral therapies. To date, cognitive behavioral therapy modified for bipolar disorder has yielded disappointing results. While differences in dysfunctional beliefs noted between unipolar and bipolar patients have been identified that could improve therapeutic approaches, until recently there has been no reliable method of assessing beliefs in remitted bipolar disorder patients. Y Alatiq and colleagues from the University of Oxford therefore administered the Hypomanic Attitudes and Positive Prediction Inventory (HAPPI), as well as the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS) to 40 remitted bipolar disorder patients, 20 remitted unipolar patients, and 20 healthy controls. There were no significant differences in terms of the history of depression or current depressive mood symptoms between bipolar and unipolar patients, both scoring significantly more than controls. Bipolar patients scored more highly on current manic symptoms than both unipolar patients and controls, with no significant differences between the latter. There were no significant differences between the groups in DAS scores, whether in terms of total scores of any of the subscales, or after taking age into account, the team reports in the Journal of Affective Disorders. Bipolar patients had significantly higher HAPPI scores than unipolar patients and controls in terms of total scores as well as scores on the self-catastrophic beliefs, other negative beliefs, and response style, even after controlling for age. There were no significant differences between unipolar patients and controls. The team writes: To conclude, the study has confirmed that bipolar patients when in remission hold dysfunctional beliefs related to the elevated mood experience which are found to be specific to bipolar disorder. Further study is now needed to look at whether cognitive behavioural therapy for bipolar disorder might benefit from working on such beliefs. Free abstract 
 Melatonin light super-sensitivity identified in bipolar I disorder By Liam Davenport, MedWire News 15 October 2009 Acta Neuropsychiatrica 2009; 21: 246255 Patients with bipolar I disorder have melatonin super-sensitivity to light compared with healthy individuals, which may serve as an endophenotypic marker for the condition, conclude Australian researchers. Several studies have suggested that bipolar disorder patients have super-sensitivity to light at night, with plasma melatonin levels suppressed more than in patients with other affective disorders and healthy individuals. However, the findings have not been supported by all investigations, with some suggesting sensitivity in only bipolar I disorder patients. To examine melatonin sensitivity to light over a range of light intensities, Karen Hallam, from the University of Melbourne in Victoria, and colleagues studied seven patients with bipolar I disorder and 34 healthy controls. The participants were administered a series of questionnaires and then attended 1 to 4 testing nights separated by at least a 7-day recovery period, with melatonin levels measured in blood samples obtained throughout the night. They were kept in complete darkness between 21:00 h and 24:00 h, exposed to light intensities of 0, 200, 500, and 1000 lux between 24:00 h and 01:00 h, and then returned to complete darkness for the remainder of the night. During zero light conditions, there were no significant differences in the changes in melatonin levels between patients and controls. However, during exposure to 200, 500, and 1000 lux, patients showed significantly more sensitivity to light than controls, with the sensitivity consistently elevated across the lightresponse curve. Sensitivity to light was dose-dependent in both groups, with a regression analysis indicating that patients and controls had a similar regression slope, although it was steeper for patients than controls., Bipolar disorder patients had a significantly greater rebound in melatonin levels 30 minutes following the light being turned off, although this difference had been eliminated by 60 minutes, the team notes in the journal Acta Neuropsychiatrica. They write: This study further investigates the usefulness of melatonin super-sensitivity to light as an endophenotypic marker of bipolar disorder. The use of endophenotypic markers that integrate both clinical and biological observations may provide a powerful tool to target genetic, molecular, and behavioral changes in the disorder. Ideally, these observations will inform both etiological and neurobiological studies of the disorder and ultimately improve clinical treatment of the illness. Free abstract 
 Unstable alcohol consumption linked to hypomania vulnerability By Lucy Piper, MedWire News 25 February 2010 Compr Psychiatry 2010; 51: 171176 Unstable alcohol consumption and binge drinking may be a marker of increased risk for hypomania, say researchers. They note that a generally increased consumption of alcohol was not associated with an increased risk for hypomania, however. Therefore, individuals at risk for hypomania might not necessarily drink more over a given period of time but show greater fluctuations in their drinking, explain Thomas Myer and Larissa Wolkenstein, from the University of Tübingen in Germany. This supports the idea that instability in different areas of behavior is characteristic of vulnerability to hypomania, they write in the journal Comprehensive Psychiatry. In an interview with 120 male students who had completed the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS), the researchers administered the FORM 90 to assess daily drinking in the 90 days prior to the interview. The participants also completed the Composite Diagnostic Interview to derive psychiatric diagnoses. Regression analyses of the data showed that, as expected, men with alcohol-related disorders drank significantly more alcohol than other men, and more frequently. When they looked at individual fluctuations in the amount of alcohol consumed, the researchers found that only men at risk for hypomania showed intra-individual fluctuations in alcohol consumption beyond the clinical diagnosis of abuse or dependency. Vulnerability for hypomania was also significantly associated with the amount of alcohol drank on each drinking day, whereas it was not associated with the number of abstinent days. This means that people scoring high on the HPS did not drink more often than did those low in risk, but when they started drinking alcohol, they drank more, say Myer and Wolkenstein. They conclude: Our results suggest that risk for hypomania is associated with a specific pattern of alcohol consumption characterized by a more variable drinking pattern and binge drinking. This association was not explained by the presence of an alcohol-related or affective disorder, so that it is unlikely just to be a symptom of them. The researchers say that this specific drinking pattern highlights instability as a core factor in vulnerability for bipolar disorder. They recommend further research into the motivational and affective processes associated with drinking alcohol and bipolar disorder to determine how mood and drinking are related. Free abstract 
 Bipolar Disorder-OCD may be separate disease entity By Andrew Czyzewski, MedWire News 06 April 2010 Acta Neuropsychiatrica 2010: 22: 8186 Patients with bipolar disorder and comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) present with more depressive episodes and are at a greater risk for treatment-emergent mania than their peers with bipolar disorder alone, research shows. As the comorbid patients also had a greater burden of anxiety and impulse control disorders the findings raise the possibility that this group represents a distinct disease entity. A recent analysis of the US Epidemiological Catchment Area Study data set found that lifetime rates of OCD in patients with bipolar disorder and major depression were 21% and 12.2%, respectively. Although OCD-bipolar disorder comorbidity is now considered highly prevalent, very few controlled studies have examined the impact of comorbid OCD on the course and treatment of bipolar disorder, Beny Lafer (University of São Paulo School of Medicine, Brazil) and colleagues comment in the journal Acta Neuropsychiatrica. For the present study the researchers recruited 30 clinically stable female outpatients with bipolar disorder, divided into two groups: bipolar disorder-OCD, consisting of 15 patients; and bipolar disorder only, also 15 patients. The groups were matched for age, ethnicity, education, and socioeconomic status. Following structured clinical interview with the DSM-IV, Lafer and team found that the bipolar disorder-OCD patients presented with a greater number of previous depressive episodes, more chronic episodes, and more residual symptoms after an episode, than the bipolar disorder only patients. Of the bipolar disorder-OCD patients, 86% had a history of treatment-emergent mania, compared with only 40% of the bipolar disorder only patients. In addition patients with bipolar disorder-OCD showed a higher prevalence of several psychiatric disorders compared with the bipolar disorder only patients, including any anxiety disorder (93.3 vs 53.3%); impulse control disorders (60% vs 13.3%); eating disorders (33.3 vs 0%); and tic disorders (33.3 vs 0%). Although the data available are insufficient to allow us to define OCD-bipolar disorder comorbidity as a distinct entity, future research examining the familial-genetic and neurobiological aspects of this comorbidity will further the understanding of its exact nature, Lafer and colleagues conclude.

 Bipolar disorder linked to certain positive psychological traits By Andrew Czyzewski, MedWire News 01 June 2010 J Affect Disord 2010; Advance online publication Patients with bipolar disorder frequently display positive psychological traits including spirituality, empathy, creativity, realism, and resilience at a level equal or higher to that of mentally healthy controls, a review of the literature shows. Clinicians should aim to preserve and enhance these traits since they may improve illness outcomes, say co-author Nassir Ghaemi (Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA) and colleagues. They add that a better appreciation of the positive aspects of mental illness is one way to combat the stigma frequently experience by patients with bipolar disorder. Ghaemi and colleagues performed a literature search for studies assessing the positive psychological characteristics of bipolar disorder. They found a total of 81 articles, with the key positive traits being spirituality, empathy, creativity, realism, and resilience. One study found that 2066% of patients with bipolar disorder rely on spiritual belief and practice their faith without negative impact on their affective illness, while another study found that strength of beliefs was a better predictor of good outcomes in bipolar disorder than any other psychiatric comorbidity in the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Two studies found increased empathy in depressed bipolar disorder patients relative to mentally healthy controls, and a third found that compassion predicted decreased mania severity after 6 months of follow-up, suggesting it may serve as a protective factor. While anecdotal evidence has long suggested enhanced creativity in bipolar disorder, a recent controlled study found patients with bipolar disorder and creative controls, but not major depressive disorder patients, had similarly enhanced creativity on the Baron & Welsch Art Scale (BWAS) compared with healthy controls. It has been repeatedly shown that depressed bipolar patients are more realistic than the non-depressed in several experiments that measure one's sense of control. In one study patients with high self-reported depression scores correctly attributed errors to themselves in studies where errors were sometimes experimentally introduced; by contrast, healthy individuals reported more control over experimental tasks than they actually possessed. Regarding resilience, one study reported that patients with bipolar disorder who were previously diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and exposed to a new traumatic experience had a lower prevalence of new PTSD symptoms compared with patients without PTSD. If mood episodes in bipolar disorder can be conceptualized as discrete traumata then each recovery from a mood episode can be seen as an opportunity for post-traumatic growth, the researchers say. Paying attention to positive psychological issues may be an innovative strategy to obtain better clinical outcomes in this illness, Ghaemi et al conclude in the Journal of Affective Disorders.

 Intrusive memories increased in bipolar mood states By Lucy Piper, MedWire News 18 June 2010 Behav Res Ther 2010; 48: 698703 Patients with bipolar disorder often experience intrusive memories of the past that become more distressing during depressive episodes, UK study findings show. The results also showed that bipolar depression was associated with seeing vivid images focussed on death and suicide. In contrast, intrusive memories were rare in hypomanic states, and these episodes were more associated with vivid, enjoyable images of future events. Behaviors and emotions in different bipolar states may be amplified by characteristic intrusive memories and images, suggesting novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention, say Chris Brewin, from University College London, and colleagues. The researchers studied the presence of memory and image intrusions in 29 euthymic patients with bipolar disorder. Intrusive memories were defined as visual images of a particular event or episode from the past that were recalled spontaneously and repeatedly, while intrusive images were scenes that came to mind repeatedly but that did not correspond directly to an event from the past and could be an imaginary situation. The participants were asked to report on intrusive memories and images from the previous week when they were euthymic and from their most recent episode of depression and hypomania. In all, 17 (59%), 22 (76%), and four (14%) participants reported experiencing intrusive memories during euthymia, depression, and hypomania, respectively. For intrusive images, none were reported during euthymia, and 13 (45%) and 19 (66%) patients reported experiencing them during depression and hypomania, respectively. Follow-up tests indicated that there was no difference in the frequency of intrusive memories between euthymia and depressed states, but they occurred significantly more during these times than during hypomania. Intrusive images were equally prevalent during depression and hypomania, and were significantly more common during these episodes than during euthymia. The characteristics of intrusive cognitions differed according to mood states. During euthymia and depression they appeared to encapsulate past-focused negative experiences, which were more distressing and interfered more with daily activities during depression. Depression was also associated with vivid and distressing future-focused images that typically involved death or suicide. In contrast, intrusive images in hypomania rarely featured past-focused negative experience; instead, they tended to be vivid positive future-oriented events involving goal-oriented events that were interpersonal in nature. Brewin and team suggest in the journal Behavior Research and Therapy that treatments that have shown promise for reducing intrusive memories in patients with unipolar depression may also be effective for bipolar disorder patients. The two possibilities they cite are: imagery rescripting to create an alternative representation that will compete effectively with the intruding image or memory to prevent the amplification of an unwanted mood state; and more general, meta-cognitive strategies such as detached mindfulness in response to intruding memories and images.

 Atypical bipolar disorder features predict reduced treatment response By Andrew Czyzewski, MedWire News 06 July 2010 Bipolar Disord 2010; 12: 390396 Bipolar disorder patients with atypical features of illness, such as psychotic symptoms and rapid cycling, are more likely than other patients to relapse while on long-term treatment with mood stabilizers, study results show. "Our findings should prompt physicians to reassess response to lithium in patients with atypical features regularly and, if necessary, to modify treatment - for instance, by adding anticonvulsants to lithium after an inadequate treatment response has been realized," comment Andrea Pfennig (Dresden University of Technology, Germany) and colleagues in the journal Bipolar Disorders. Bipolar disorder is a serious psychiatric disease, which has a recurrent, chronic course in the majority of patients. Although many patients experience only a few episodes during their lifetime, around 10-15% will suffer more than 10 episodes. Lithium has proved to be effective for acute and prophylactic treatment and is recommended in current guidelines. Some studies have suggested an association between so-called atypical features and the quality of response to lithium; however, the impact of atypical features on long-term prophylaxis has not been assessed. In the present study, the researchers recruited 336 patients with bipolar disorder who all showed response to treatment with lithium. Over an average period of 10 years (range, 1-33 years) the researchers recorded episodes of recurrence and measured atypical illness features, namely mood-incongruent psychotic symptoms, interepisodic residual symptomatology, more manic than depressive episodes, psychiatric comorbidity, and rapid cycling. In all, 205 (61%) patients experienced a new episode after initiating lithium treatment (range: 0-19 episodes). Of these, 52 patients experienced one episode, 43 two episodes, 22 three, 25 four, and 62 experienced five or more episodes. The first recurrence was observed within 12 months of starting lithium treatment in 32% of patients and within 2 years after starting treatment in 50%. Patients with at least two atypical features had a 50% increased risk for a further relapse compared with patients without any atypical features. The risk for a new episode increased significantly by 21% with each additional atypical feature. "There are still differences in long-term outcome, even among patients who respond relatively well to long-term lithium prophylaxis," say Pfennig and colleagues who recommend modifying existing treatment where necessary. Abstract 
 Eating disorders common in bipolar patients By Mark Cowen, MedWire News 04 August 2010 J Affect Disord 2010; Advance online publication Eating disorders affect around one in seven patients with bipolar disorder, are more common in women, and are associated with an earlier age of onset and a more severe course of illness, US study results suggest. "Substantial clinical and community data indicate that bipolar disorder co-occurs with substance use, anxiety, and impulse control disorders, and that these comorbidities are associated with negative effects on the course, outcome, and treatment response of bipolar disorder," explain Susan McElroy (Craig and Frances Lindner Center of HOPE, Mason, Ohio) and team. "Another comorbidity which has received far less systematic attention but which may also be important is that between bipolar disorder and eating disorders," they add. To investigate further, the researchers studied 875 outpatients (56% women) with bipolar I or II disorder who were aged an average of 41.1 years. Bipolar illness characteristics and comorbid Axis I disorders, including the eating disorders anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder, were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-P). The patients also underwent clinical examinations and were interviewed about demographic factors, family history of psychiatric illness, and historical illness variables, such as age of onset of mood symptoms, rapid cycling, suicide attempts, and course of illness. In total, 125 (14.3%) patients met criteria for at least one lifetime eating disorder, 104 (83.0%) of whom were women. The most common eating disorder was binge eating (n=77), followed by bulimia nervosa (n=42) and anorexia nervosa (n=27). Bipolar disorder patients with an eating disorder had a younger current mean age (38.8 vs 41.4 years), a younger mean age at bipolar illness onset (18.2 vs 21.3 years), a greater mean number of prior hypomania/mania episodes (18.9 vs 14.8), and a greater mean number of prior episodes of depression (21.1 vs 17.2) compared with those without an eating disorder. Bipolar patients with an eating disorder also had a higher mean body mass index (31.1 vs 27.2 kg/m2), and were more likely to have history of rapid cycling and suicide attempts, and a family history of depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism, and drug abuse than those without an eating disorder. McElroy and team conclude in the Journal of Affective Disorders: "Our findings are consistent with others suggesting that bipolar disorder may co-occur with eating disorders, and this relationship likely has clinical and theoretical significance." They add: "Further research examining the overlap of these disorders would therefore appear to be just as important as further research into their differences." Abstract 
 Combination treatment benefits patients with refractory bipolar disorder By Mark Cowen, MedWire News 07 September 2010 J Affect Disord 2010; 126: 8087 Results from a Spanish study suggest that psychotherapy combined with pharmacotherapy has greater short- and long-term benefits for patients with refractory bipolar disorder than pharmacotherapy alone. "Current pharmacological treatments fail to control the course of bipolar disorder in half of the cases," explain Ana González Isasi (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain) and team. They add: "Patients with a refractory bipolar disorder frequently have a poor prognosis; they usually present residual symptoms, rapid cycling, and suicide attempts, in spite of an appropriate treatment with mood stabilizers. Furthermore, even without presentation of rapid cycling, these patients may suffer frequent relapses and have severe difficulties in their social-occupational functioning." To investigate the short- and long-term benefits of combining psychotherapy (psycho-education and cognitive-behavioral therapy) with pharmacotherapy, the researchers enrolled 40 patients with refractory bipolar disorder who were receiving treatment with mood stabilizers. Of the participants, 20 were randomly assigned to an intervention group that received combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, while the remainder were assigned to a control group that continued to receive pharmacotherapy alone. Psychotherapy consisted of 20 weekly 1.5-hour sessions led by a clinical psychologist assisted by psychiatric nurses. There were no significant differences between the two groups at baseline regarding gender distribution, age, number of prior hospitalizations, number of recent hospitalizations, use of mood stabilizers, adherence, persistent affective symptoms (Beck's Depression Index score >7, Young Mania Rating Scale score >6), and/or severe difficulties in social-occupational functioning (Inadaptation Scale score >14). The researchers found that immediately after completion of the psychotherapy program (post-treatment evaluation), 45% of patients in the intervention group still had persistent affective symptoms and/or difficulties in social-occupational functioning. In contrast, 80% of controls met these criteria at this time. At the 6-month evaluation, 40% of patients in the intervention group still had persistent affective symptoms and/or difficulties in social-occupational functioning compared with 80% of controls, and 30% and 83%, respectively, were affected by these problems at the 12-month evaluation. All of these between-group differences were significant, the researchers note. They also found that, overall, patients in the intervention group were hospitalized less often than those in the control group, although intervention patients had been hospitalized more often than controls at the time of the post-treatment evaluation. Isasi and team conclude in the Journal of Affective Disorders: "Our results suggest that a combined treatment is effective in patients with refractory bipolar disorder. Further research lines could address the evaluation of each of the components of the psychological program (psycho-education and cognitive-behavioral therapy) or other psychological approaches (behavioral experiments or exposure techniques), as well as the possible additive effect of setting up a psycho-education program for relatives who live with the patients." Abstract 
 8 Ways to Help Your Bipolar Loved One Cope by Therese J. Borchard, Beyond Blue Friday August 20, 2010 Depression and bipolar disorder are family diseases. Everyone sharing a kitchen and a bathroom is affected. In fact, in his book, Understanding Depression, J. Raymond DePaulo Jr., M.D., writes that "depression ... has a much greater impact on marital life than rheumatoid arthritis or cardiac illness. One study found that only severe forms of cancer affected a family as adversely as depression or bipolar disorder." My manic depression could have easily wrecked my marriage and my relationships with my two children. Instead, we emerged as a tighter, stronger unit. How? Here are eight ways Eric helped me cope--tips for families on how, exactly, to hang in there with a loved one who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. 1. Educate yourself. I remember the afternoon of my first severe panic attack. I phoned Eric at work as my breath grew shallow and my heart pounded as if I were having a heart attack. I was sure I was dying. As soon as he walked through the door, he stared at me suspiciously. My limbs were in place, and I seemed to be functioning just fine. What was the problem? "You don't understand," I explained. "I thought I was dying! It was the most frightening experience I have ever had." What convinced my spouse that my bipolar disorder was an illness, not a weakness? Research. The reams of paper that I printed out and asked him to read. The psychiatric evaluations he witnessed. The group therapy and family sessions he attended. And the conversations with other spouses of persons with bipolar disorder. Education is always the starting point. Because until a spouse or daughter or friend of a manic-depressive understands the illness, it is impossible to say and do the right thing. Do your own research by going online to NAMI.org (National Alliance of Mental Illness) or to dbsalliance.org (Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance), or by doing a Google search for the words "bipolar disorder." 2. Learn how to talk to your loved one. Eric doesn't say much when I'm clutching tissue paper, crying my eyes out. And he's hesitant to speak when I'm manic (not that I would let him get in a word). When I don't want to get out of bed in the morning, he reminds me why I need to. And when I'm revved up, he's the voice of reason telling me why a spontaneous trip to New York isn't smart. Anna Bishop, wife of fellow blogger James Bishop (findingoptimism.com) has some wonderful advice for the loved one of a manic depressive on what to say and when: When James becomes ill he turns into a different person. I say goodbye to my husband, so to speak, and hello to bipolar James. In a depressive episode he becomes highly irritable and usually itches for a fight. Early on he will often make comments to bait me. "All I do is work, work, work, to support your lifestyle and your precious social group." You can imagine what a red rag to a bull that comment is. At this point I have 2 options: (1) Take the bait, have a messy fight and accelerate his downswing, or (2) Grit my teeth and say "it's the illness speaking". If I can do that then I have a much better chance of diffusing the situation. A comment like "You sound stressed about work - let's talk" has better results and sometimes can even stop the mood swing.3. Make some rules. You know all the fire drills in primary school you prayed would happen during the math pop quiz? All those times the school administrators rehearsed what, exactly, would happen in the case of an emergency? Families of bipolar persons need them as well: a plan of action for those times when the a bipolar person is sick. In order to design a such a strategy, the manic depressive and her loved one must compile a list of symptoms--like the smoke and burning smell of that make-believe fire in the third grade--and what action should follow them, like "call the doctor." Each family will have a different list of symptoms and a different model of recovery, because no two illnesses are exactly alike. Eric and I have agreed that I will call my doctor after two consecutive night's sleep under five hours, or after three days of crying spells. A friend of mine told me that he and his wife have agreed that she will see her psychiatrist if she hasn't gotten out of bed for three days. 4. Plan for emergencies. As part of the above plan of action, you should consider what should happen when the bipolar person is very ill. "When you are dealing with a disease that has the potential to become life-threatening, the last thing you want is an improvised response to an emergency situation," writes Francis Mark Mondimore, M.D. in his book Bipolar Disorder: A Guide for Patients and Families. Part of your plan should include a list of people who you can call for help. Of course, it is recommended that the bipolar person be working closely with a psychiatrist, and that he know how to get in touch with the psychiatrist after hours, and in case of emergencies. It's also a good idea to know which hospital the psychiatrist works with, or if the doctor will work with any hospital in the area. Ask friends, doctors, and family members for their recommendations about hospitals and mental-health practitioners. Also, the red tape of insurance issues is often too overwhelming to process at the time of the emergency, so get familiar with the details of your medical insurance coverage for psychiatric illnesses right now. Know the terms of hospital coverage, especially, and how much the patient is expected to pay out of pocket for various services. 5. Listen. "When people are talking," writes Rachel Naomi Remen, "there's no need to do anything but receive them. Just take them in. Listen to what they're saying. Care about it. Most times caring about it is even more important than understanding it." When I think back to the days when I was very ill, crying and shaking at the dinner table and at preschool functions with the kids, no response was as appreciated as when someone simply listened. Suggestions came off as condescending, even though I know they were meant to be helpful. Advice was annoying. Many times I just needed to be heard, to be validated. Don't hesitate to say nothing. Because silence often speaks the most loving message. 6. Go gentle. I can't count all the times I have tried Eric's patience with the reckless highs and debilitating lows of my bipolar disorder. When I get fired up and want to sign up for 60 new activities--not to mention losing my car keys, cell phone, and purse--it's difficult for him not to get annoyed. But because he places my exasperating behavior in the proper context of an illness, and sees them as mere symptoms of a disease--rather than careless and self-absorbed actions--he is better able to go gentle with me. Moreover, a little kindness and gentleness toward your loved one--especially at those times that you feel incapable of affection and care-- goes a long way to aid recovery. 7. Laugh together. Humor heals in so many ways. It combats fear, as it loosens anxiety's death grip on your heart and every other living organ. It comforts and relaxes. And recent studies indicate that humor also reduces pain and boosts a person's immune system. "Laughter dissolves tension, stress, anxiety, irritation, anger, grief, and depression," says Chuck Gallozzi of personal-development.com. "Like crying, laughter lowers inhibitions, allowing the release of pent-up emotions. After a hearty bout of laughter, you will experience a sense of well-being. Simply put, he who laughs, lasts. After all, if you can laugh at it, you can live with it. Remember, a person without a sense of humor is like a car without shock absorbers." Humor also aids communication, and if there is one thing besides education that is absolutely essential for a healthy relationship with a bipolar loved one it's good communication. 8. Get support for yourself. Care-giving is draining. Even when you are protecting yourself with the armor of regular sleep, healthy meals, and essential time-outs from your sick loved one, caring for a person still takes a toll on your physical and mental health. "It can be exhausting to live with a hypomanic person and frustrating to deal with a seriously depressed person day after day," says Dr. Mondimore. "The changes and unpredictability of the moods of someone with bipolar disorder intrude into home life and can be the source of severe stress in relationships, straining them to breaking point." That's why you need support as much as your loved one. You need to talk to people who have lived with a manic-depressive, and be validated by their experiences. Spouses and family members of bipolar persons should consider therapy for themselves, as a way of processing all the stress. You may also benefit from checking out support programs for spouses and loved ones of the mentally ill, like www.NAMI.org (National Alliance for Mental Illness) that are available today. 
 I was just wondering, well ive been told i have Bipolar but i sence they are still not 100% sure, Ive also got Avoident, When im feeling REALLY awesome'lly happy i will come online and talk ( type ) to everyone online and get so excited and type loads and i'll want to buy stuff and go back to all my classes and have all these goals for the future, but my psych said id also be Talking ( not typing ) to everyone and not caring.. talking fast and not bothering what anyone thinks, I do want to sometimes.. but something inside me stops me.. like i want to swear sometimes, but if i do i will die! I think its something like that.. or part of the avoident, because inside im so happy i want to shout WOOHOOO, but this thing inside me wont let me out! but i just dont know if they have it right saying biploar, as i wont talk to anyone! I dont even think any of this makes sence! but if you know what i mean then thats good.. i cant explain good what im thinking! When i feel down which is most the time im really the opposite a differnt person almost. Im doing good right now though. I jsut dont think i'll ever truley know what is is i feel everything is conflicting with everything and my head is about to explode! 
 I've been reading quite a bit on bipolar, and the more I read, the more scared I get. I get scared about the future, reading about how symptoms get worse as you get older, and the body doesn't respond as well to medication....is this true? I'm scared I'm not going to make it. Most days I want to, but occassionally, I decide it's too much work with too little payoff. I feel really discouraged right now and scared about what the future looks like for someone who has bipolar. 
 Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder May Go Undiagnosed in Some Adults with Major Depression NIMH August 16, 2010 Nearly 40 percent of people with major depression may also have subthreshold hypomania, a form of mania that does not fully meet current diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder, according to a new NIMH-funded study. The study was published online ahead of print August 15, 2010, in the American Journal of Psychiatry. Background Mania is a symptom of bipolar disorder. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), it is generally defined as a discrete period of increased energy, activity, euphoria or irritability that leads to marked impairment in ones daily life. The DSM-IV states that a manic episode lasts for one week or more, and may sometimes require hospitalization. Hypomania is defined as a milder form of mania that lasts for four days at a time, but does not interfere with ones daily activities. The majority of people diagnosed with bipolar disorder experience repeated episodes of hypomania rather than mania. For this new study, Kathleen Merikangas, PhD., of NIMH, and colleagues aimed to characterize the full spectrum of mania by identifying hypomanic episodes that last less than four days among those diagnosed with major depression. They described this type of hypomania as subthreshold hypomania. Merikangas and colleagues used data from 5,692 respondents of the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), a nationally representative survey of American adults ages 18 and older. Results of the Study The researchers found that nearly 40 percent of those identified as having major depression also had symptoms of subthreshold hypomania. Compared to those with major depression alone, those with depression plus subthreshold hypomania tended to be younger at age of onset and to have had more coexisting health problems, more episodes of depression and more suicide attempts. They also found that among those with subthreshold hypomania, a family history of mania was just as common as it was among people with bipolar disorder. Significance According to the researchers, the findings indicate that many adults with major depression may in fact have mild but clinically significant symptoms of bipolar disorder. In addition, because many with subthreshold hypomania had a family history of mania, the researchers suggest that subthreshold hypomania may be predictive of future hypomania or mania. Previous research has indicated that young people with subthreshold hypomania symptoms are more likely to develop bipolar disorder over time, compared to those without subthreshold hypomania, said the authors. Whats Next The researchers suggest that depression and mania may be defined as dimensions, rather than as discrete diagnostic categories. Clinicians should be aware that patients who report repeated episodes of subthreshold hypomania may have a risk of developing mania, the researcher concluded.

 Am I Manic? Therese J. Borchard Thursday May 27, 2010 Most people envision mania as the woman who rings up $2000 on her master card, or the guy up all night composing music. But mania, and especially hypomania, need not be so obvious or extreme. If you suffer from a "soft" bipolar disorder (Bipolar Disorder II for one today) like I do, where the manic cycles are somewhat difficult to identify, you need friends and family by your side to help you recognize when you're heading into the danger zone.

 Impaired Awareness of Illness (Anosognosia): A Major Problem for Individuals with Bipolar Disorder Healthy Place March 13, 2010 Detailed description of anosognosia and how it impacts people with bipolar disorder when it comes to medication compliance. Impaired awareness of illness (anosognosia) is a major problem because it is the single largest reason why individuals with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia do not take their medications. It is caused by damage to specific parts of the brain, especially the right hemisphere. It affects approximately 50 percent of individuals with schizophrenia and 40 percent of individuals with bipolar disorder. When taking medications, awareness of illness improves in some patients. What is impaired awareness of illness? Impaired awareness of illness means that the person does not recognize that he/she is sick. The person believes that their delusions are real (e.g. the woman across the street really is being paid by the CIA to spy on him/her) and that their hallucinations are real (e.g. the voices really are instructions being sent by the President). Impaired awareness of illness is the same thing as lack of insight. The term used by neurologists for impaired awareness of illness is anosognosia, which comes from the Greek word for disease (nosos) and knowledge (gnosis). It literally means "to not know a disease." How big a problem is it? Many studies of individuals with schizophrenia report that approximately half of them have moderate or severe impairment in their awareness of illness. Studies of bipolar disorder suggest that approximately 40 percent of individuals with this disease also have impaired awareness of illness. This is especially true if the person with bipolar disorder also has delusions and/or hallucinations. Amador XF et. al. Awareness of illness in schizophrenia and schizoaffective and mood disorders. Archives of General Psychiatry 51:826-836, 1994.Fennig S et. al. Insight in first-admission psychotic patients. Schizophrenia Research 22:257-263, 1996.Is this a new problem? I've never heard of it before. Impaired awareness of illness in individuals with psychiatric disorders has been known for hundreds of years. In 1604 in his play, The Honest Whore, playwright Thomas Dekker has a character say: "That proves you mad because you know it not." Among neurologists unawareness of illness is well known since it also occurs in some individuals with strokes, brain tumors, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. The term anosognosia was first used by a French neurologist in 1914. However in psychiatry impaired awareness of illness has only become widely discussed since the late 1980s. Prigatono GP and Schacter DL. eds. Awareness of Deficit After Brain Injury. New York: Oxford University Press, 1991.Is impaired awareness of illness the same thing as denial of illness? No. Denial is a psychological mechanism which we all use, more or less. Impaired awareness of illness, on the other hand, has a biological basis and is caused by damage to the brain, especially the right brain hemisphere. The specific brain areas which appear to be most involved are the frontal lobe and part of the parietal lobe. Flashman LA. Specific frontal lobe subregions correlated with unawareness of illness in schizophrenia. Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience 13:255-257, 2001.Amador XF and David AS eds. Insight and Psychosis. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. Can a person be partially aware of their illness? Yes. Impaired awareness of illness is a relative, not an absolute problem. Some individuals may also fluctuate over time in their awareness, being more aware when they are in remission but losing the awareness when they relapse. Are there ways to improve a person's awareness of their illness? Studies suggest that approximately one-third of individuals with schizophrenia improve in awareness of their illness when they take antipsychotic medication. Studies also suggest that a larger percentage of individuals with bipolar disorder improve on medication. Jorgensen P. Recovery and insight in schizophrenia. Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica 92:436-440, 1995. Why is impaired awareness of illness important in bipolar disorder? Impaired awareness of illness is the single biggest reason why individuals with bipolar disorder do not take medication. They do not believe they are sick, so why should they? Without medication, the person's symptoms become worse. This often makes them more vulnerable to being victimized and committing suicide. It also often leads to rehospitalization, homelessness, being incarcerated in jail or prison, and violent acts against others because of the untreated symptoms. Lin IF. Insight and adherence to medication in chronic schizophrenia. Journal of Clinical Psychiatry 40:430-432, 1979.Lacro J et al. Prevalence and risk factors for medication nonadherence in patients with schizophrenia: A comprehensive review of recent literature. Journal of Clinical Psychiatry 63:892-909, 2002.McEvoy JP et. al. Insight and clinical outcome of schizophrenia patients. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disorder 177:48-51, 1989.Impaired awareness of illness is a strange thing. It is difficult to understand how a person who is sick would not know it. Impaired awareness of illness is very difficult for other people to comprehend. To other people, a person's psychiatric symptoms seem so obvious that its hard to believe the person is not aware he/she is ill. Oliver Sacks, in his book The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, noted this problem: It is not only difficult, it is impossible for patients with certain right-hemisphere syndromes to know their own problems...And it is singularly difficult, for even the most sensitive observer, to picture the inner state, the 'situation' of such patients, for this is almost unimaginably remote from anything he himself has ever known. 
 Things have been going well lately. Really well. The problem is, now I can't stop thinking that I'm going to crash. I have this intense need to bring it on to get it over with. I have really mixed feelings - I know what it feels like to crash, so it's not like it'll be a huge surprise. I don't want to crash, but I don't think there's anything I can do to prevent it, so I just want it to hurry up. The anxiety is starting to build, and I'm afraid it'll hit when I'm away for work in a couple weeks. I tend to be more suicidal when I'm away from home, so a crash away from home is never a good thing. Is there anything I can do to prevent this? Do I just go about my day and see if it'll bypass me? I don't know if I'm inducing it, or feeling it creeping up, but it's right around the corner...that much I know. 
 It's really amazing how much my mind has cleared. I feel like the slate has been cleaned off, and, to use a metaphor, like a clean install of an operating system on a pc. As a result, I feel like I am having an identity crisis, which I never did have as a teenager. The difference being, I have all these "adult" tools to deal with it. So, it should be easier to establish who "I" am. I think. My Top Seven differences between me on Seroquel.... and not.Seroquel-Sleep 6-8hr. No seroquel-2-3hrIncreased Ti, lower Fe/ especially Fi (MBTI stuff).Less obsessiveness/perfectionism. Leads to more peaceful relationships.Less anxiety.No guilt or feelings of worthlessness.Less overreaction.No hypomania/mixed episode. These are hard to deal with and difficult to extricate oneself.Still trying to trace back when the bipolar 2 kicked in. I suspect around the age of 13, then I was "normal" until I "broke" again at age 17, then again at 20. After this point it was depressed/hypomanic all the time except for very short breaks of less than 2 weeks. When I was a teenager, the medical profession still thought that depression didn't occur in children or teens. They were very wrong. 
 Staging a Bipolar Disorder Intervention By Candida Fink MD June 2, 2010 One of the symptoms of bipolar disorder is a lack of insight  an inability (not unwillingness) to notice a significant shift in ones own mood or behavior. This happens most often during acute mood episodes  manic or depressed  but can be part of the bigger picture of living with the illness. Family members agonize over how to help someone who doesnt want help, and they sometimes watch helplessly as the illness destroys their loved ones life. If the person is at risk of harming herself or someone else, the doctor may have to hospitalize her against her will. This, of course, is a confrontation that coerces the patient into treatment. But what about the individual whose symptoms are destructive but not acutely at risk of suicide or aggression? What about spending all the family money, committing serial infidelities, or not going to work for months? What is a family to do when the person cannot see the difficulties and cannot seek help themselves? Psychiatrists and psychologists have no clear cut solution or approach to dealing with situations such as these. Every case is different. Following are some suggestions on how to proceed. Get the Treatment Team Involved If your loved one with bipolar is already connected to a treatment team, contact the team leader (your loved ones psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker) or another mental health professional on the team and inform the person of the situation and of your concerns. The team will usually try to work with the family and other loved ones to re-engage the person into care. If your loved ones healthcare providers say they cannot speak with you, that may be true, but they can listen and take action on the information and insight you provide. Contact a Mental Health Professional Contact a mental health professional (a psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker) on your own to obtain guidance. You have nothing to lose by getting more information from professionals. In addition, you may need counseling yourself to deal with the trauma these situations often cause. Seek the Assistance of a Local Support Group Contact a local chapter of NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness or DBSA: Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance. These are great resources to learn how other families have navigated this journey and to get information about the mental healthcare system in your area. Through local support groups, you may also discover other potential resources, such as employer mental health programs or community agencies that may be able to step in. Adjust Your Own Attitude and Expectations Your loved one is doing the best he can  what he thinks he needs to be doing to be okay. Lack of insight and poor judgment are part of their illness. Thinking and decision making are impaired  especially during acute episodes. Trying to get someone to just change his mind and listen to reason when the mind is being held hostage by the mood disorder doesnt work very well or at all. Entering the conversation with the idea that the person can simply change his mind when he really cant merely leads to frustration, distress, and resentment. The person with bipolar does not have good control over his emotional responses, so fairly or not, it is incumbent upon loved ones and caregivers to regulate their own responses carefully. Triggering an angry or hopeless response in someone will not be productive and may make things worse. Preserve Your Own Health and Well Being Sadly, sometimes loved ones can only watch and remain available to mobilize help or support as soon as the person with bipolar disorder has even the slightest change of heart. You may need to make decisions about your own health and well being based on untreated bipolar symptoms. Be clear and firm about the steps you will need to take to preserve your health and well being if your loved one does not agree to treatment, but do this in as non-confrontational a manner as possible. Presenting consequences in confrontational and/or angry terms  essentially cornering the person you are trying to help  will be no more effective than presenting your terms in a more conciliatory manner. Anyone who feels cornered will not be able to make the best decisions, so dont expect your loved one with bipolar to be different in this regard. Caution: If you decide to stage a formal intervention of some sort to try to force or coerce someone into care, always involve a mental health professional. If your loved one tends to become angry or overwhelmed, a confrontational intervention can become dangerous and do more harm than good. 
 I saw my p/doc 3 weeks ago and was telling him about being stressed out. But basically, he said said that its more than just stressed out. So I went up on the lithium like I am supposed to...but I don't think anything is changing. I think it helps me some with my sleep, like it just makes me tired. I have this constant brain storm going on in my head, sometimes creative toher times very very negative. I am oversensitive and get depressed over stuff or flip out get in people's face or both. The other day I went to the gym but had to leave after walking one lap around the track because there was so much going on in there and it was freaking me out. I wasn't that bothered by the people just the activity. One day I was at home freaking out really bad and I decided to quit my job. I changed my mind a few days later and my boss took me back. Then I was wondering if I should do that because I was freaking out at work and about to bail. Everything went smoothly so I could hang in there. The last few days have been better as in less negative but I feel like I am on speed darting around never taking a break all day (6hrs). I have been sleeping relatively ok like 7 hours on the higher lithium level. Here's weird part: I keep seeing these faces everywhere and many of them look agonized and grotesque. They are in things like the carpets, trees, food...etc whatever. I'm not seeing things that are not there mostly just like looking at clouds and seeing stuiff in the clouds. Only a few of the faces looked real or moved but it was in my peripherial or in the dark. I saw a lady for a second in my back yard but when I looked away she dissapeared. That's not really hallucinating is it? They don't really bother me that much. I called my doctor's office a week ago and told this nurse there what was going on (minus the faces) and she didn't take me seriously, it seemed like she didn't feel like talking to me. It stressed me out and I just gave up. She said she would talk to my doctor but nobody ever called me back. I dunno what to do...the last few days haven't been as bad it seems so i never did call again. I dunno what to do, I don't want to have to quit my job because I freak out. This is the first job I jave had in 2 years. I don't want to call them because I feel like I am just being a whiny pain in the ass because today wasn't so bad. I dunno what to do and if I should tell them about the faces. 
 Migraine prevalent and problematic in bipolar disorder By Andrew Czyzewski, Medwire News 01 July 2010 Bipolar Disord 2010; 12:397403 A quarter of patients with bipolar disorder experience migraines, and those who do have an increased rate of suicidal behavior, anxiety disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder, study results show. Furthermore, analysis of a separate cohort of migraine patients showed a prevalence of bipolar disorder of 6.35%, which compares with around 1.00% in the general population. "While the association between psychiatric disorders and migraine may or may not be a causal one, a greater understanding of these specific relations may contribute to our understanding of the underlying etiologies of both conditions," Martin Alda (Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada) and colleagues comment in the journal Bipolar Disorders. Emerging evidence from empirical and conceptual studies suggests an association between migraine and affective disorders. For example, a genome-wide linkage study of comorbid bipolar disorder and migraine recently reported an overlapping susceptibility for both disorders. Furthermore, alterations in sodium and calcium channels are thought to underlie the pathophysiology of both bipolar disorder and migraine. In the current study the researchers recruited 204 participants with bipolar I disorder, 92 with bipolar II disorder, and 27 with bipolar disorder not otherwise specified or schizoaffective disorder. Migraine history was assessed by means of a structured questionnaire. In all 24.5% of the sample had comorbid migraine, with bipolar II disorder patients showing a significantly higher prevalence, at 34.8%, than bipolar I disorder patients, at 19.1%. Bipolar disorder patients with comorbid migraine had significantly higher rates of suicidal behavior, social phobia, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder than those without migraine. For example, 40% of bipolar disorder patients with migraine reported a history of suicide attempts compared with just 27% in bipolar disorder patients without migraine. In a secondary analysis, Alda and team also assessed 102 migraine patients from a specialty migraine clinic. They found that 73.5% had a lifetime psychiatric diagnosis of which 4.9% was bipolar I disorder and 7.8% was bipolar II disorder. Discussing their findings, Alda et al say that bipolar disorder patients with comorbid migraine "may indeed have a different profile in terms of the clinical course of the disorder and treatment response." Abstract 
 I'm absolutely exhausted today and I think it's just because I overdid it the last couple of days...working way too many hours. But...I have alot to do, and it seems like if I'm not hypomanic I can't get anything done. I'm sitting here trying to find some energy and, well, the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. In other words, I know what I need to do, I want to get it done, but I'm just fried. I'm having trouble finding balance - being able to do things at a steady space instead of getting everything done only when I'm hypomanic. Will this even itself out in time? 
 I'm off my meds again. I'm having such a hard time with so much stuff, and it always starts the same...I forget for a day or two, and then just don't go back to them because I felt fine for that day or two so I figure I must be ok. I know that's so wrong...logically. I think right now I'm having a really hard time trusting them. I know that sounds weird, but when I look at them, I look at them as an extension of the person who prescribed them, among others, and don't see the value in them. I know people who have bipolar tend to go off meds...it's a big problem, and while my one doctor is questioning that diagnosis, I'm not for a second. I know I have bipolar. I know I need them. Why can't I shove them down my throat and just be done with it? I have to find a way to get back on them stat. I'm away at the end of July and CANNOT crash while I'm at the other end of the country with no support or resources. I'm in Vegas in August and want to enjoy that trip. I cannot be hospitalized before, during, or after either of these trips. I don't want to become another statistic. I don't want to be in a place where I feel like suicide is an option again. I've fought so hard, for so long, that I want to succeed at this. I hate that I struggle so much with them. I was doing well - six and a half months of taking them...and now this. It really sucks. But I'm going to find a way to start back on them...I'll force myself...I have to. I don't want to be a statistc that could have been prevented just by taking them. I suppose I don't have to like it...I just have to learn to trust them, right? Maybe that's the secret for me...trust that they will help me. 
 Bipolar Disorder Fundamentals by Elisha Goldstein, Ph.D. Jun 29th 2010 In considering bipolar disorder, it's important to understand a few fundamental things to pay attention to, symptoms, triggers, and the wisdom of a tracking sheet. Let's take a look at the ABC's of this right now: A. Symptom Education - The first thing we want to do is be aware of your symptoms. There are 3 types of symptoms that pertain to Bipolar Disorder depending on whether the mood is depressed, manic or mixed. With depressed symptoms, you may notice a lack of interest on pleasure in things, a restlessness, sleep issues, fatigue, change in appetite, and even thoughts of suicide.With manic symptoms you may notice more extreme irritability or perhaps feeling excessively high or euphoric. Your mind may be racing far more than usual or you might notice needing less sleep to function. In this mood it's possible to engage in irresponsible behaviors of spending sprees, risky sexual behavior, or an increase in any drug or alcohol use. Most of all, there is often thoughts of denying that anything is wrong (partly because it often, but not always, feels good).With mixed symptoms there is more agitation, inability to sleep, pressured crying, and even psychosis.B. Trigger Education - You also want to make sure you understand the triggers to these symptoms. If you are diagnosed with bipolar disorder than there are a number of potential triggers that would be good to be aware of so you can manage better. You'll want to be aware of getting good sleep, engaging in stress reduction practices, notice if the change of seasons effect you, be aware that it's easy to skip medication during manic times, and that a regular exercise practice is wonderful for creating balance.C. Tracking - It is often a great idea to create a list of these symptoms and mark off when you experience them over the course of a couple weeks. There are really very few mental health professionals who are adept at diagnosing bipolar disorder and so having this checklist will greatly aid in you getting a more accurate diagnosis. If any of this is sounding familiar with you and there is distress in your life, I'd recommend starting the tracking sheet and making an appointment with a mental health professional. At the end of the day, you always have choices and we are active participants in our health and well-being.

 Anger Management Tips by Jerry Kennard Wednesday, June 16, 2010 "Any tips on controlling anger?" asks Jen. "I've tried exercising to release the energy, journaling for the feelings, but nothing has helped all that much." Anger is a perfectly normal feature of the human condition and by its very nature we tend to feel justified in expressing anger at times of frustration, stress or fear. Anger is one of the most expressive signs of discomfort. Its effect is to vent negative emotions but, as everyone knows, it also causes the person on the receiving end to feel unsettled and upset. Most people prefer to avoid situations that result in confrontation. For this reason it may lead to unreasonable levels of compliance on the part of the recipient in their attempts to placate or smooth over situations that might otherwise result in an outburst. This may work for a time but intolerance tends to be a hungry beast which quickly finds new things to feed on. Anger is also a common feature of mania. Any challenge to plans being hatched or projects being undertaken can be met with a sharp tongue or a torrent of abuse. The vehicle for this is likely to be the intolerance that sometimes accompanies grandiose thought processes associated with mania. People with bipolar often comment on their absolute certainty and confidence during periods of mania. Creativity is a well known outcome of mania but it can come at something of a cost. During a time of mania everyday events can appear incredibly slow and mundane. Minor errors, or the speed at which you are served in a shop, can easily and rapidly go off the hair-pulling scale. The sometimes indiscriminate nature of anger is one of the most obvious signs of illness. Not everyone flies into a rage at every opportunity, but the barbed and acidic comments that may be leveled at a partner can become toxic over time and serve to undermine even the most tolerant of people. When Jen asks about tips for controlling anger it seems clear she's already been looking into the issue and has tried exercise and journals. I hope she hasn't decided to throw in the towel as these two things can be really quite useful and it shows that Jen is taking charge of her own situation. They are however only a couple of tools in the box and so Jen might need a few more ideas to help cope with her anger emotions. There are no end of tips that might be suggested so I'm going to select a few and hope that people reading this might contribute their own ideas. Let's start with the lead up to anger. It might be useful for Jen to revisit the events and situations that help trigger her feelings of anger. Are they certain people, financial arrangements, household chores, etc. It's impossible to erase everything that causes irritations but it may be possible to consider ways of avoiding or dealing with some of these issues so they don't escalate. A major source of anger is other people. The tip here is to work on methods that defuse potentially difficult situations before they develop. Instead of reacting, try leaving the room. Make yourself pause before responding. The fact that you can remember to pause suggests that you are in control of your emotions, not the other way around. In social situations avoid alcohol. So, you've left the room and you're still fuming, now what? Your angry side is urging you to go back and let rip - but as you've come this far - so let's think through a few more positive options. Take a couple of deep breaths. Try to consider whether the situation you've just walked away from is really so terrible. Gaining perspective is all a part of gaining mastery over your environment. So let's assume your actions have effectively defused a potentially angry confrontation. That's excellent, but let's not pretend you haven't been affected. You maybe need a way to express your anger. Jen has been using a journal and this is a well researched and effective method to express emotions. It doesn't necessarily for work for everyone however, and sometimes you need a shoulder to cry on or a friend you can trust to talk things out. In this post I've focused on a certain level or intensity of anger that is within the grasp of the individual to control. Clearly, if anger leads to thoughts of suicide, self-harm or harm to others, it is time to seek out professional help. 
 Intrusive memories increased in bipolar mood states By Lucy Piper, MedWire News 18 June 2010 Behav Res Ther 2010; 48: 698703 Patients with bipolar disorder often experience intrusive memories of the past that become more distressing during depressive episodes, UK study findings show. The results also showed that bipolar depression was associated with seeing vivid images focussed on death and suicide. In contrast, intrusive memories were rare in hypomanic states, and these episodes were more associated with vivid, enjoyable images of future events. Behaviors and emotions in different bipolar states may be amplified by characteristic intrusive memories and images, suggesting novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention, say Chris Brewin, from University College London, and colleagues. The researchers studied the presence of memory and image intrusions in 29 euthymic patients with bipolar disorder. Intrusive memories were defined as visual images of a particular event or episode from the past that were recalled spontaneously and repeatedly, while intrusive images were scenes that came to mind repeatedly but that did not correspond directly to an event from the past and could be an imaginary situation. The participants were asked to report on intrusive memories and images from the previous week when they were euthymic and from their most recent episode of depression and hypomania. In all, 17 (59%), 22 (76%), and four (14%) participants reported experiencing intrusive memories during euthymia, depression, and hypomania, respectively. For intrusive images, none were reported during euthymia, and 13 (45%) and 19 (66%) patients reported experiencing them during depression and hypomania, respectively. Follow-up tests indicated that there was no difference in the frequency of intrusive memories between euthymia and depressed states, but they occurred significantly more during these times than during hypomania. Intrusive images were equally prevalent during depression and hypomania, and were significantly more common during these episodes than during euthymia. The characteristics of intrusive cognitions differed according to mood states. During euthymia and depression they appeared to encapsulate past-focused negative experiences, which were more distressing and interfered more with daily activities during depression. Depression was also associated with vivid and distressing future-focused images that typically involved death or suicide. In contrast, intrusive images in hypomania rarely featured past-focused negative experience; instead, they tended to be vivid positive future-oriented events involving goal-oriented events that were interpersonal in nature. Brewin and team suggest in the journal Behavior Research and Therapy that treatments that have shown promise for reducing intrusive memories in patients with unipolar depression may also be effective for bipolar disorder patients. The two possibilities they cite are: imagery rescripting to create an alternative representation that will compete effectively with the intruding image or memory to prevent the amplification of an unwanted mood state; and more general, meta-cognitive strategies such as detached mindfulness in response to intruding memories and images. Abstract 
 Understanding the Switch Process in Bipolar Disorder By Hannah Dunbar Wednesday, June 9, 2010 Note: Hannah Dunbar is a summer research student from Oral Roberts University. Today she will be summarizing some of the key issues in the neurobiology of the switch process in bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is a somewhat unique mental disorder in that the onset of a mood swing can be quite dramatic--a patient with bipolar disorder can be fine one day and manic the next. It is important to try to understand the pathophysiology behind this rapid switch mechanism. Introduction: Dr. Giacomo Salvadore, M.D. from the NIMH along with colleagues from NIMH, Johnson & Johnson and Roche Pharmaceuticals recently published an excellent summary of the switch process in bipolar disorder. No uniform definition exists for switching seen in bipolar patients, so Dr. Salvadore and colleagues defined switching, as the sudden transition from a mood episode to another episode of the opposite polarity with an intervening period of no more than 1 month. Further understanding of the mechanism of the switching process, will likely prove vital in understanding the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. Dr. Salavodore and colleagues outlined the clinical predictors of switching, individual neurotransmitter systems and possible biological mechanisms. Sleep deprivation and switch: Sleep deprivation has also been proposed as a final common pathway leading to onset of mania, and can be triggered by many environmental stimuli, psychological, interpersonal, or pharmacological factors . Sleep deprivation produces an acute antidepressant response in as many as 80% of subjects with bipolar depression, and 60% of patients with unipolar depression. Spontaneous switch rates have also been correlated with sleep deprivation, with switch rates ranging from 10% to 30% in patients with BD. This phenomenon makes it important for patients with bipolar disorder to get regular sleep hours. They should avoid medications that produce insomnia (i.e pseudoephedrine, other stimulants) and be cautious when traveling across time zones. Psychological stress (i.e. death of a loved one or loss of job) may produce temporary insomnia resulting in a manic or depressive switch. Medical illnesses that cause insomnia (i.e. influenza) should be monitored for risk of mania induction. Role of circadian rhythms: Mania switches were also found to be correlated with circadian rhythm consistent with finding sleep deprivation as detrimental to mood stability in bipolar disorder. Increased nocturnal motor activity and decreased REM sleep in particular have been noted prior to a manic switch. Salvadore and colleagues noted interactions between sleep reduction and a sleep-sensitive circadian phase interval could promote switches from depression. One confounding clinical issue is whether circadian rhythm disruptions proceed or follow the onset of mania. It is possible all the changes in sleep and biological clock function are secondary to the primary mood disturbance. Antidepressants and switch: Antidepressant drugs have been found to induce switching in 10% to 70% of patients. Clinicians and patients should know that treating bipolar depression with antidepressants alone is not good practice due to this high switch rate. Important switch rate found in certain clinical trials of antidepressants may provide understanding of the neurobiology of the switch process by analyzing switch rates for antidepressants that target different specific neurotransmitter systems. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been most closely associated with a high risk of switching. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appear to have a lower risk for switching than TCAs. New antidepressants with both serotonergic and noradrenergic effects may be more likely to induce a switch than SSRIs. Data from several genetic studies investigating polymorphisms involved in the homeostasis of the serotonergic system, suggested it as having a negligible role in the switch process in bipolar disorder, with one exception. Mundo and colleagues found that short allele polymorphism of the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) was overrepresented in the patients who developed a switch after receiving SSRIs. However these correlations were not confirmed in subsequent studies. Dopaminergic agonists (psychostimulants) and switch: Several dopaminergic selective drugs, such as psychostimulants have long been associated with high rates of switching and have been empirically tested in preclinical studies. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of switching with use of cocaine, methamphetamine and ecstasy. Additionally, dopaminergic drugs commonly used for Parkinson's disease may also induce mania. Summary: Patients and clinicians should be alert to potential triggers for mood disorders in bipolar disorder. Sleep and circadian rhythm problems appear to be a common trigger. Disruption of a variety of neurotransmitter systems may also contribute to the switch phenomenon. Further research will be needed to extend our knowledge of the switch process in bipolar disorder.

 Kay Redfield Jamison: A profile in courage by Jacqueline L. Salmon, bp Magazine Winter 2009 kay%20redfield%20jamison.jpg The small woman in the black sweater sitting near the podium at the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA) annual conference in Norfolk, Virginia, was intent on her notes, preparing for her keynote address to the crowded auditorium. One by one, her admirers appeared. They lined up to ask her about medications and doctors, or to vent their frustrations about a medical system that often seems to little understand their illness. And one by one, Kay Redfield Jamison, PhD, listened patiently and answered their questions. With her blond hair, upturned nose, and girlish cotton skirt and sandals, Jamison looks much younger than her 62 years. She raises her eyebrows when told that she had been expected to be more subdued. “I’m not a quiet person,” she says with a laugh. Lively and sharp-witted with almost a bird-like quality to her, Jamison sat for a brief interview with bp Magazine at the DBSA meeting in September 2008. It’s tough to get Jamison alone at such a gathering. She is continually bombarded with admirers; she listens to their stories, nodding sympathetically to tales that must seem woefully familiar to her by now. After a few minutes, she slips away from one conversation, only to be wrapped up in another. At a reception the evening before her address to the DBSA conference, Jamison carefully slid her chair out from against a wall with a practiced gesture so she wouldn’t be trapped if she needed to move away from questioners. The public attention Jamison faces is constant—she received 30,000 letters following the publication of her bestselling 1995 memoir, An Unquiet Mind, a raw and honest story of her own battles with bipolar. Indeed, the author of five books and more than 100 scientific articles about bipolar disorder has become the public face of the illness because of the book’s impact, and also from her appearances on popular television programs like The Oprah Winfrey Show and Larry King Live. Those suffering from bipolar illness certainly see her as one of them. “Her book was very inspiring,” says Susan Millikan of Concord, New Hampshire, who attended the DBSA meeting in Norfolk, marveling at “all that she went through, and she came out from it.” Recent years have brought significant challenges to Jamison. Her mother, Dell, with whom she was very close, died in 2007. Her husband, Richard Wyatt, chief of neuropsychiatry at the National Institute of Mental Health and “the major support” in her life, died in 2002. But Jamison and her friends say she has rallied from these losses. Moreover, the lithium that she has been taking for more than three decades continues to curb her illness. Despite a “rough patch” last summer, Jamison tells bp Magazine that she is feeling well. “I’ve been very, very fortunate,” she says. “How she manages is an inspiration,” says Myrna Weissman, PhD, professor of epidemiology and psychiatry at Columbia University and chief of the Department in Clinical-Genetic Epidemiology at New York State Psychiatric Institute, who has known Jamison for years. “She has great intelligence, great spirit, and a wonderful family, and her personal qualities attract many friends who love and support her when and if she needs it.” During the bp interview, Jamison illustrates her points with rapid gestures, arguing, for example, that “manic-depression” is a more appropriate term for the illness than “bipolar,” which she calls offensive because she believes it minimizes the illness. “The term ‘manic depression,’” she insists, “is the most scientifically accurate, most historically descriptive [term]. “When we say bipolar, it kind of implies there is mania over here,” Jamison adds, moving one hand in one direction, “and depression over here”—she sweeps her other hand in the other direction. “That they are on opposite poles. [But] the ancients made the argument years ago that, in fact, mania was just a severe form of depression. … [the term] bipolar is way too tidy.” Whatever the illness is called, Jamison is hopeful that its stigma will fade with the strides that have been made in treatment. “Ultimately, destigmatization comes about through treatment and research,” she states. “If you look at the destigmatization of epilepsy and cancer, it was tied to treatment. AIDS became much less stigmatized when it was no longer believed it was always related to death. Cancer began to be treatable … epilepsy the same way when treatments began to be available. Now we have treatments for depression and, increasingly, they exist for bipolar.” Jamison’s own resistance to treatment is a major theme of An Unquiet Mind. In 1974, a colleague she had been dating diagnosed her as manic-depressive. The diagnosis came shortly after she joined the UCLA faculty as an assistant professor of psychiatry. At the time, Jamison was in the middle of a major manic episode. She worked tremendous hours and did not sleep; she couldn’t follow the path of her own thoughts. She engaged in profligate overspending, for example, scooping up 20 books published by Penguin because she thought it would be nice if the penguins would form a colony. She bought expensive jewelry, provocative clothing, and a dozen snakebite kits because she had information direct from God that an infestation of rattlesnakes was imminent. When Jamison was prescribed lithium, it had only recently been approved for use in mania. The standard medical practice then was to maintain patients at considerably higher blood levels of lithium than is prescribed nowadays. As a result, Jamison had terrible side effects from the drug—severe nausea and vomiting, and slurred speech that at times made her appear drunk and threw off her coordination. Mentally, she had impaired concentration and memory and an almost complete breakdown in her ability to read—devastating to one whose life revolved around ideas and research. In order to understand anything, Jamison had to read the same line repeatedly and to take copious notes. For an entire decade, she didn’t read a serious book of fiction or nonfiction. Even worse than the side effects, however, was the self-denial, she recounts in An Unquiet Mind. Somehow, Jamison thought she was an exception to the research that shows that the illness not only comes back—but that it comes back more severely and more frequently if left untreated. Like other manic-depressives, Jamison was loath to give up the intense highs. Life seemed less intoxicating, less interesting when she was “normal,” she recalls in her book. Despite the fact she knew the risks, she went on and off lithium for years. Jamison says part of her reluctance to stay on lithium was her family background. “I was always brought up to be independent. I was brought up in the military—none of these things augers well for taking anything that resembles a crutch, or in any way acknowledges that you can’t just sail through,” she comments during the interview with bp Magazine. “It just wasn’t done in my family. It’s easier now, but it’s still hard for people.” Between the manias, Jamison had crippling depressions: At the age of 28, she tried to commit suicide by taking a massive overdose of lithium. She was saved when she picked up the ringing phone. Her brother, Dean Jamison (recently retired professor in the anthropology, history and social medicine department at the University of California, San Francisco), was calling from Paris to check on her. Jamison used that experience in writing Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide. She says she decided to write a book about suicide after being shocked by the number of people who came up to her after her book readings for An Unquiet Mind to tell her about their own suicide attempts or the suicide of loved ones—particularly young people. “There is a huge relationship between suicide and being under the age of 30, but that’s exactly the age group that is least likely to be compliant in taking medication,” Jamison points out. It was only after the sudden death of her lover, a 44-year-old British psychiatrist, when Jamison was 32, that she settled down to taking lithium regularly and then, several years later, was able to lower the dose and the side effects faded. Jamison has said she is grateful that lithium continues to work for her. Indeed, with greater mood stability, her creativity and productivity increased exponentially—as did her capacity for happiness. Fearing that disclosure would damage her academic and hard-won professional career, Jamison kept her illness secret from even her closest associates. She did inform her bosses, however, and received nothing but encouragement from them, she related to the packed auditorium at the DBSA meeting in Norfolk. Her big break professionally came when Frederick K. Goodwin, MD, research professor of psychiatry at George Washington University—who was one of the few who knew of her illness—asked her to coauthor the textbook Manic-Depressive Illness, first published in 1990. Goodwin says he requested Jamison as his coauthor because he knew she could understand the illness in a way he never could and therefore would add a deeper dimension to the book. The pair recently updated this textbook, and it was re-issued in 2007. Only after the publication of Manic-Depressive Illness and Touched With Fire, her 1993 book about the link between creativity and manic depression, did Jamison decide to write a book about her own illness. She had grown weary of hiding her secret and was tired of “the hypocrisy and tired of acting as though I had nothing to hide.” Colleagues say Jamison was shrewd to wait to make a public revelation until after she had established her professional credentials with Manic-Depressive Illness. “She wasn’t well-known, and the book gave her a kind of a scholarly anchor,” says Goodwin. “She was smart in terms of taking care of herself [first],” adds Kenneth Duckworth, MD, medical director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. Written for a general audience, An Unquiet Mind caused a sensation in her own field, as well as among the public, catapulting Jamison into her now familiar role as a well-known figure and authority on bipolar. The honors came thick and fast—she was named one of the Best Doctors in the United States, and was chosen by Time magazine as a “Hero of Medicine.” In 2001, she won a MacArthur Foundation “genius” grant. Today, a major figure at conferences and public events, Jamison urges those with bipolar who approach her to stay on their medicine, although she points out that resistance to treatment is a factor with other illnesses and medicine as well. “It’s not unique to psychiatric patients and it’s certainly not unique to bipolar,” Jamison tells bp Magazine. “You can’t get people to stay on a 10-day course of antibiotics. … So why [some individuals] think that people should stay on medication indefinitely, with very serious side effects that are stigmatizing, cost money—very often that they don’t have—is beyond me.” These days, Jamison works mostly out of her home in Washington, DC, and travels one day a week to teach at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, where she is professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. She also travels regularly to coastal Scotland, where she is honorary professor of English and neurophysiology at the wind-swept University of St. Andrews. Here she found a source of peace and creativity after spending a year there while an undergraduate at UCLA. As always, Jamison uses her personal experiences to fuel her work. She is currently writing a new book—a sequel to An Unquiet Mind called Nothing Was The Same, which is due out in the spring. She tells bp that it will focus on the differences and similarities between grief and depression, as well as her recovery from her husband’s death. Jamison says she wants to speak out for those suffering from bipolar who—because of a lack of information, poor medical advice, stigma, or fear of personal and professional reprisals—do not seek treatment at all. “I think pharmaceutical companies have sort of made it a much more benign-sounding illness than it is,” she tells bp Magazine. “It remains a very severe illness.” Meanwhile, officials of groups advocating for the rights of the mentally ill say they are grateful for Jamison’s support of their organizations and her visibility. “Mental illness is a club that nobody wants to belong to,” says Duckworth of NAMI. “And when you find attractive, compelling, amazing people who are in the club—who are successful and likeable and brilliant—it makes it easier to contemplate joining. So every time Mike Wallace, Jane Pauley, or Kay Jamison says, ‘You know, I’m in this club, too,’ that’s very powerful information because a lot of people spend a very long time fighting being in the club.” In her DBSA speech in Virginia, Jamison gave a powerful defense of the illness and what it can offer those who suffer from it. “To suffer is to have learned,” she told the rapt crowd, pointing out that creative geniuses like Anne Sexton, Robert Lowell, Virginia Woolf, and Edgar Allan Poe (“never really chipper even on a good day”) used their suffering for their work. All of us should learn from the turmoil and pain in our lives, Jamison told her audience. Manic-depressive illness, she reminds, “is not a gentle or easy disease.” “I believe that curiosity, wonder, and passion are defining qualities of imaginative minds and great teachers,” she continued, “that restlessness and discontent are vital things; and that intense experience and suffering instruct us in ways that less intense emotions can never do. … It is important to value intellect and discipline, of course, but it is also important to recognize the power of irrationality, enthusiasm, and vast energy.” For her fans, who gave her a standing ovation, Jamison continues to speak for them.

 Fasten Your Seatbelts! The Rollercoaster Ride of Manic Depression by Therese J. Borchard, Beyond Blue Thursday May 27, 2010 Thank you to all the Beyond Blue readers who asked me for an update on my health. In my post, Grateful and Depressed? You Can Be Both, I explained that I have been in a depressive cycle for about nine months. Able to function. Most people probably couldn't tell, assuming my smile was genuine. But looming over every event, moment, situation was that longing to be on the other side of life (i.e., death), desperate for a relief of some kind for the chronic pain. Although I had lots of good days--even some weeks--I mostly woke up with that familiar nausea and dread you feel when you've fallen into the black abyss. Dr. Smith has been inching up my Zoloft. I started at 50 milligrams (which I was taking with 100 mg of Nortriptyline and 1050 mg of Lithium). I didn't notice any change in my depression until two weeks ago, when I started taking 175 mg of Zoloft. I clearly marked the morning in my mood journal when I woke up without any thoughts of death, and was actually excited to start the day. It feels so foreign, not to have to constantly fight the morbid thoughts. I guess I had grown so accustomed to the depression--applying all the coping skills I have learned over the years--that I figured it was a permanent disposition. You do that when it lasts more than six weeks. You assume the black hole is your home and start buying furniture for it. Moreover, with me, I always fear hypomania when I start to feel good. Because the lands of "wellness" and "hypomania" share a small strip of real estate that is forever being contested. As soon as some homes go up, the other says it's their property and tears them down. Fuzzy terrain ... determining what is level and what is at a slight incline. That's why Dr. Smith inched up the Zoloft by 12.5 mg. I am hypersensitive to increased levels of SSRIs. In the past, increasing the dose by 25 mg has triggered a hypomania. Now I do love being hypomanic. Not only can I complete today's and tomorrow's to-do list done in an hour, but I want sex! I can leave my below-sea-level self-esteem in the ocean because I actually have self-confidence! I believe in my own capabilities and when someone questions that, I tell him to go somewhere warm and don't think twice. Ah yes. It's a great way to be! But what goes up must come down. Unfortunately. And the crashes I've experienced after a hypomania are brutal. You definitely want to avoid them. This, however, is the message I want to relay to all of you who are fighting chronic death thoughts and waking up with nausea and dread: depression doesn't last forever. Having camped out in the black hole for three seasons straight, I was beginning to think that I would never ever escape. But I did. And so will you 
 Am I Manic? by Therese J. Borchard, Beyond Blue Thursday May 27, 2010 Most people envision mania as the woman who rings up $2000 on her master card, or the guy up all night composing music. But mania, and especially hypomania, need not be so obvious or extreme. If you suffer from a "soft" bipolar disorder (Bipolar Disorder II for one today) like I do, where the manic cycles are somewhat difficult to identify, you need friends and family by your side to help you recognize when you're heading into the danger zone.

 Avoiding the Helpfulness Trap By Joe Kraynak on Helping Someone with Bipolar May 25, 2010 When a loved one is cycling into mania, she may become more energized than usualmore driven to get everything done all at once. If youre a people pleaser by nature, its easy to get swept up into the vortex and even contribute to it by being too helpful (in the wrong ways). If possible, its better to slow down and take a more rational approach. Otherwise, you and your loved one are likely to run around like chickens with your heads cut off, increasing everyones stress level. As we write in Bipolar Disorder for Dummies, bipolar mania tends to feed itself. Mania increases stress, which fuels the mania, which further increases stress and deepens the mania. It can be a vicious cycle. One way to help break the cycle is to try to stop or at least slow down its momentum. Instead of offering to help your loved one with bipolar execute all his plans and projects right here right now by running errands, making phone calls, etc., consider helping him draw up a plan of attack that provides plenty of time to get everything done. This can add the structure and focus necessary to alleviate some of the anxiety over the need to get everything done at once. Of course, its also necessary during these early stages of mania (the hypomanic times) to encourage your loved one to remain in close contact with his psychiatrist. A medication adjustment (possibly only a temporary adjustment) may be needed to prevent they hypomania from slipping into a full-blown manic episode. 
 It's been over three weeks since I last crashed, and I've made some really good progress in stabilizing my moods. The problem now is that I feel like I don't know how to function outside of crash mode - I feel like I need to do something to bring on a crash so I feel "normal" (my normal) again. I get the lunacy of that...but I just feel so far out of my comfort zone, and like things aren't predictable. Before, I knew I was going to crash, I knew how to handle it, I knew when to expect it, etc. Now, it's like staring at a blank slate, not knowing what's lurking around the corner. I don't truly want to crash - it's horrible and feeling suicidal is definitely not fun, but I feel like if I can bring a crash on, then I can just move on. Argh...this is a big hump, and it's inducing some anxiety for sure. 
 Is Bipolar Disorder Overdiagnosed in Adults? By Candida Fink MD May 11, 2010 There has been a lot of discussion about the over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder in kids, but what about in adults? In the wake of increased bipolar awareness and vigilance, are doctors mistaking other disorders or even excessive irritability and anger as bipolar disorder? If the doctor has a hammer, does everything start to look like a nail? Researchers in Rhode Island have looked at this specific question and found evidence of a pattern of over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder in adults. In a study published in 2008, Zimmerman and others reported that out of a group of 700 patients who had previously received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, fewer than half met the criteria when given a more comprehensive psychiatric evaluation. In 2010, the same researchers published additional data about the 82 people in the study who had been given a prior diagnosis of bipolar but did not meet criteria for the diagnosis under more careful scrutiny. The most common diagnosis in that group was borderline personality disorder. There was a high rate of co-occurrence with higher rates of conditions such as major depression, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), impulse control disorders, and eating disorders, but these were often folded into the borderline diagnosis. The core diagnostic confusion in both adults and children, it seems to me, is due to the brewing notion that mood reactivity or dysregulation, characterized by chronic irritability, anger, and explosive behavior, may be some variation on the more well defined, discrete mood episodes (depression or manic or mixed) seen in classical bipolar disorder. Many different types of mental illness can cause chronic irritability and problems with anger. The question seems to be whether more of these illnesses should come under the bipolar label. The label is important because it guides treatment. However, based on the diagnostic criteria that we currently have in the DSM IV, unless a pattern of sustained episodes of hypomania, mania, or mixed states accompanies the depression, then it is not bipolar disorder. Is there scientific evidence for this idea of a spectrum of mood regulation problems that includes bipolar disorder at one end and irritability and explosive rages at the other? The answer is a resounding “We don’t know.” But until we have more specific data to say otherwise, we rely on the diagnostic structures that are in place. We won’t have more objective answers to these questions until genetic research and studies of actual brain structure and function help us understand the true neurological story of these conditions. These will lead us to more standardized ways to classify and treat bipolar disorder and its potential variations. In the meantime, we must be as scrupulous and detailed as possible in making these diagnoses and be humble about our abilities to accurately distinguish between chronic irritability with dysregulated mood and the cycles of bipolar disorder. We need to listen to our patients and ourselves as our starting point and not get stuck in an inflexible way of thinking or diagnosing our patients, since we are far from having a truly scientific vision that will guide us in purely objective ways. 
 I'm wondering if anyone here who has Bipolar or something similar indicates that on a Medic Alert-type bracelet? Because of the amount of medication I'm taking, I'm wondering if it's something worth considering. Thoughts?? 
 The Seduction of Hypomania By Russ Federman, PhD, ABPP, Psychology Today Mon, Apr 5 2010 For those with bipolar disorder life would be a lot easier if hypomania (mild manic symptoms) were more like a stomach ache. You'd begin to hurt or feel nauseous and the experience would signal that something is wrong. You might take an antacid, you might refrain from eating until your pain subsides, or if you do eat, you'll go for something bland and soothing. The point is your stomach ache signals that something "not good" is occurring with your digestion. But the experience of hypomania is more complicated. First, it's important to recognize that the majority of people with bipolar disorder spend about 75% of their time in the depressed end of the bipolar spectrum (see previous blog dated 2/7/10 to understand hypomania in the context of the broader bipolar spectrum). And even if hypomania occurs while you're experiencing normal midrange mood, it comes along and seductively beckons with the promise of pleasure. Imagine you've been feeling down for a while. The cold, gray, dreary months of November through March haven't offered much to support positive mood. Then along comes springtime with more daylight hours, a trend towards warming, bright wonderful sunshine and an entire natural environment that seems to be "waking up" from its winter dormancy. Before you know it, you too feel the same sense of invigorating aliveness. You're waking up earlier in the morning and your energy is readily available - no more desire to pull the blankets over your head and return to the soothing cocoon of sleep. Your thoughts are moving faster, you're connected to your creativity and you're experiencing the desire to open up and blossom, just like everything else around you. You breeze through your day with a fair amount of energy and when evening comes along you don't really want to wind down. There is so much more still to do and sleep feels like interference. The problem is, this is no stomach ache! There's nothing that intuitively feels bad about the early aspects of hypomania; in fact your experience is just the opposite. Hypomania comes along and says "Hey, let's go play!" Why would you not say, "Sure, I'm in!" And then it's a slippery slope from there, only your trajectory is upward (at least initially). What creates double trouble is when the elevated energy and accompanying behaviors aren't inhibited and when your need for sleep continues to decline, hypomania can spawn further intensification. In other words, the pleasurable impulses which feel like heightened productivity or innocuous play can easily progress towards something more dangerous and turbulent. Gentle springtime turns into a summer tornado. Some with bipolar disorder are able to utilize healthy adaptation where appropriate measures are taken to keep from being swept up in the storm, but usually we see this in those who have lived with their disorder for several many years. They've become keenly attuned to the more subtle nuances of hypomanic mood. When elevated mood arrives a mild warning alarm sounds instead of the more natural response of setting restraint aside and going with the flow. This healthy inhibition or even the recognition that a medication adjustment may become necessary requires excellent self-observing skills plus an appreciation of the potential negative consequences of hypomania. Unfortunately, it's difficult to be successful with this when you're relatively new to the disorder because there's not much in your experience that teaches this lesson. However, the more you come to know what your hypomania feels like, the better you'll become at identifying its influence and taking appropriate corrective actions. The good news is that there is usually a positive progression of adaptive learning in those living with bipolar disorder. What I've just laid out may be one of the most difficult challenges of having bipolar disorder. If you're bipolar, you can't necessarily trust the natural ebb and flow of mood and emotion. Thinking, self-observing and applying good judgment must become the transformative mantra of the bipolar young adult. And once you get it that just because your experience "feels good" it doesn't always mean "it's good for you," you're more than halfway towards figuring out how to remain stable.

 "There" as in..."better". I can't believe how different my life is now from six months ago. I'm able to get through the day without constant thoughts of suicide. I'm in school and enjoying it. I think I'm getting close to figuring out the right combo of meds. I feel so much better. I don't wake up in complete despair before the day has even begun. I don't go to bed at night hoping I won't wake up the next day. When I think back to six months ago, I was really, really resistant to alot of stuff, including meds. Now I'm seeing how different they can make me feel, and I'm ok with them. I want to feel good, hopeful, and happy all the time. Or most of the time anyway. I don't know if I'll crash tomorrow or next week or next month or next year...but for now, I'm doing ok, and life is good. I've turned a corner I never thought possible. 
 Polar Expedition for Bipolar Disorder by James, FindingOptimism.com April 14, 2010 In what can be described as a massive play on words, a small team of adventurers is setting out for the North Pole today, with the goal of raising funds for research into bipolar disorder. The team of 4 are currently on the island of Spitsbergen in Norway. They are spending two days of preparations, testing skis, packing sleds with food and gear, and outfitting their polar clothing, before flying by Antonov-74 aircraft to the Ice Station Borneo. (Has anyone else read “Ice Station” by Matthew Reilly? Ouch!) Actually Borneo is a Russian scientific base, erected in April each year on the the moving ice flows in the heart of the Arctic Ocean. On the 16th they will fly by Mi-8 helicopter to around 50km of the North Pole depending on current drift rate of the floating ice. From there they will spend 4-5 days skiing and sled hauling to the Pole, dragging themselves through the incredible icescapes of the the Arctic Ocean, with iconic features like pressure ridges, rubble, and leads of open water. At this time of year daylight is enjoyed 24-hours a day, a blessing for those with SAD! Although I’m glad they’re not going in May or June. The objective of the expedition is very worthy – to raise medical research funds and increase awareness about Bipolar Disorder. If you want to get on board, with financial support or otherwise, then it’s not too late. To read more visit the BiPolar Expedition website. 
 I'm desperate. I'm 58 and the meds keep the mania tamped down but the depression just won't let go. Thoughts of suicide are never far away. At night, when I'm exhausted, the idea is inviting. I'm trying to put up a good fight, which is in itself exhausting. I've decided to try taking morning walks to see if that might help. I start tomorrow. I don't know what I'll do if that doesn't work. My Dr. is trying but can't find the right mix of meds. Meanwhile, I am trying to learn how to accept the suffering as part of my present experience and move on. I keep telling myself to grow up and move forward. Has anyone been able to to this? 
 Bipolar disorder-OCD may be separate disease entity By Andrew Czyzewski, MedWire News 06 April 2010 Acta Neuropsychiatrica 2010: 22: 81–86 Patients with bipolar disorder and comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) present with more depressive episodes and are at a greater risk for treatment-emergent mania than their peers with bipolar disorder alone, research shows. As the comorbid patients also had a greater burden of anxiety and impulse control disorders the findings raise the possibility that this group represents a distinct disease entity. A recent analysis of the US Epidemiological Catchment Area Study data set found that lifetime rates of OCD in patients with bipolar disorder and major depression were 21% and 12.2%, respectively. “Although OCD-bipolar disorder comorbidity is now considered highly prevalent, very few controlled studies have examined the impact of comorbid OCD on the course and treatment of bipolar disorder,” Beny Lafer (University of São Paulo School of Medicine, Brazil) and colleagues comment in the journal Acta Neuropsychiatrica. For the present study the researchers recruited 30 clinically stable female outpatients with bipolar disorder, divided into two groups: bipolar disorder-OCD, consisting of 15 patients; and bipolar disorder only, also 15 patients. The groups were matched for age, ethnicity, education, and socioeconomic status. Following structured clinical interview with the DSM-IV, Lafer and team found that the bipolar disorder-OCD patients presented with a greater number of previous depressive episodes, more chronic episodes, and more residual symptoms after an episode, than the bipolar disorder only patients. Of the bipolar disorder-OCD patients, 86% had a history of treatment-emergent mania, compared with only 40% of the bipolar disorder only patients. In addition patients with bipolar disorder-OCD showed a higher prevalence of several psychiatric disorders compared with the bipolar disorder only patients, including any anxiety disorder (93.3 vs 53.3%); impulse control disorders (60% vs 13.3%); eating disorders (33.3 vs 0%); and tic disorders (33.3 vs 0%). “Although the data available are insufficient to allow us to define OCD-bipolar disorder comorbidity as a distinct entity, future research examining the familial-genetic and neurobiological aspects of this comorbidity will further the understanding of its exact nature,” Lafer and colleagues conclude Source: Acta Neuropsychiatrica, Volume 22, Issue 2, Pages 81 - 86 
 I was reading an article the other day on possible treatments for bipolar, which had the usual stuff about living a healthy lifestyle and taking Omega 3s and stuff. It then went on to talk about "dark therapy"...apparently staying in total darkness from about 7pm onwards, til morning, helps with circadian rhythms and depression. Is there any truth in this whatsoever? It sounds kind of hokey, but I suppose anything is possible. 
 Does Daylight Savings Time Upset Your Bipolar Balance? By Joe Kraynak March 17, 2010 My wife, who happens to have bipolar disorder, hates daylight savings time. Whether were springing forward, as we did this past Sunday, or falling back, it usually upsets her circadian rhythm just enough to trigger a chain reaction toward mania. Simply put, it throws her sleep pattern out of whack. While shes waiting for her circadian clock to reset, she usually ups her dose of melatonin and uses other sleep aids to knock herself out. She does a pretty good job of getting herself back on track, but it usually takes a week or two. Does setting your clock ahead or back upset your bipolar balance? If so, what do you do, if anything, to deal with it? 
 Five Things a Loved One Should Know About Bipolar Disorder: An Interview with Bruce Cohen, M.D., Ph.D. Therese J. Borchard Thursday March 11, 2010 Today I have the pleasure of interviewing Bruce Cohen, M.D., Ph.D, who is Director of the Harvard University McLean Psychiatric Hospital and Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. He is also the coauthor, with Chelsea Lowe, of the recently released book, Living with Someone Who's Living With Bipolar Disorder: A Practical Guide for Family, Friends, and Coworkers. Cohen lives in the Boston area. Question: I have always maintained that the best thing a person can do to support a bipolar loved one is get educated. But if you could offer folks a crash course, what are the five most important things you think a loved one should know about bipolar disorder? Dr. Cohen: Getting educated is good advice. Here are five important things everyone dealing with bipolar disorder should know: Bipolar disorder is an illness, with risk determined by genes and environment, like other medical illnesses. All medical illnesses affect mood, thinking and behavior, but there is always much more to the person than the illness. Bipolar disorder usually responds well to a combination of appropriate medication and targeted psychosocial therapies. Untreated or inadequately treated bipolar disorder can lead to many personal, career and life difficulties or even death. There is great strength and insight available in relationships, and problems that arise due to bipolar disorder, as well as evaluation of symptoms and treatments, are best handled together with your loved one. Talk with one another about bipolar disorder, privately, and go together to some doctor's appointments. An increased risk for bipolar disorder is lifelong, so it is wise to evaluate whether new concerns or difficulties experienced by someone who has had an episode of bipolar disorder are due to a recurrence of illness. In addition to professional treatment, many other lifestyle factors help, including: Support from family, friends and community; regular exercise, a good diet, and healthy sleep; and planning ahead to reduce stress. Question: Suppose a mentally ill loved one or friend doesn't want to get help, then what do you do? Dr. Cohen: Don't give up. At appropriate times, kindly and patiently talk with your loved one or friend about what you are seeing and why it is worrying you and remind them that getting an evaluation doesn't mean deciding on treatment. If your loved one or friend is in immediate danger from illness, don't be afraid to call for help from professionals, including the police. Question: Can you offer any guidance to folks regarding how they should approach so many choices with medication? For example, I found that the older drugs worked better for me, but many of the psychiatrists I saw only wanted to work with the newer ones. Do you have any insight with regards to how to get the best treatment? Dr. Cohen: Each person responds differently to medications, and it is important to find an expert who knows the options and will spend the time to work with you to find the right personalized treatment. An appropriate expert in bipolar disorder will know how to use both old and new drugs. If you are not satisfied with your treatment or comfortable with your doctor, seek a consultation or find another doctor 
 Loving Someone with Bipolar by Kathryn at Finding Optimism 4 March 2010 I knew very little about bipolar disorder when my son was diagnosed. My knowledge was limited to the assumption that there were tremendous, manic highsfollowed by deep moments of despair. I dont know how I came upon this preconceived notionbut Id never realized that depression could manifest itself in the form of annoyance and intense irritability. Extreme, prolonged, intense irritability. Yikes. Id written off Ts seething annoyance as everything from fatigue to hormonesand I still believe that a lack of sleep is a recipe for disaster. Or at minimum, it sets the stage for one hell of an argument. Ive learned over time that arguments with T are frequently dramatic, regularly intense and oftentimes draining. I used to panic at the depth of his angerId have this sense that our relationship was on the brink of devastation and Id fear that wed never be the same again. Ive since realized that like a summer thunderstorm, his anger is powerfulbut it blows over quickly. I also recognize that most of the time, my unconditional love makes me the perfect verbal punching bag for his frustration and mood swings. And yet. This is the same guy whos wickedly creative, with a wry sense of humor and the ability to deliver a joke with remarkable comedic timing. Hes charming, sensitive and will spend an inordinate amount of time helping a friend work through his problems, without any expectations or agenda. He cares deeplyabout everything. That intensity seems to be at the crux of his personality. There is no middle road with The moves at warp speed and lives his life with unbridled passion. You cant help but to get caught up in his enthusiasmto find yourself being swept up in the wave of emotions that make up a typical day in his life. This spectrum of characteristics makes T one complicated guy. Being in a relationship with him can be exhaustingand exhilarating all at the same time. He challenges you to love him for who he isand he has high expectations for himself and those around him. If I said I didnt have some concerns for his future, Id be lying. T can be unrealistically impulsiveand hes very much a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants kinda guy. Im not sure how that will translate into adulthood. I hope that with age, he may become a bit more practicaland a bit less reckless. But I hope he can maintain the qualities that make him the unique and extraordinary person Ive grown to love. As Id expect, there may not be a middle of the roadfor its all or nothing in the world, according to my amazing, complex boy. 
 Behavioral addictions linked to bipolar disorder By Lucy Piper 05 March 2010 18th European Congress of Psychiatry; Munich, Germany; 27 February2 March 2010 Patients with bipolar disorder are at increased risk for behavioral addictions, researchers have found. They reported at the 18th European Congress of Psychiatry in Munich, Germany, that these behavioral addictions appear to be linked to higher levels of impulsivity and character immaturity. M Di Nicola and colleagues from Catholic University Medical School in Rome, Italy, assessed behavioral addictions in 158 outpatients with bipolar disorder and 200 mentally healthy individuals. The main behavioral addictions assessed were pathologic gambling, compulsive shopping, sexual, internet, work, and physical exercise addictions. The researchers also administered the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) to see whether impulsivity and personality dimensions were associated with behavioral addictions in the patients. They found that 33% of bipolar disorder patients had at least one behavioral addiction, compared with just 13% of controls. The most common behavioral addictions, for which bipolar disorder patients scored significantly highly, were pathologic gambling, compulsive buying, and sexual and work addictions. Bipolar disorder patients with behavioral addictions tended to have lower levels of impulsivity than those without such addictions, while levels of the personality dimensions self-directness and cooperativeness were significantly higher. Di Nicola concluded: To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the prevalence of behavioral addictions in bipolar disorder showing a significant association of these disorders. 
 Unstable alcohol consumption linked to hypomania vulnerability By Lucy Piper, MedWire News 25 February 2010 Compr Psychiatry 2010; 51: 171176 Unstable alcohol consumption and binge drinking may be a marker of increased risk for hypomania, say researchers. They note that a generally increased consumption of alcohol was not associated with an increased risk for hypomania, however. Therefore, individuals at risk for hypomania might not necessarily drink more over a given period of time but show greater fluctuations in their drinking, explain Thomas Myer and Larissa Wolkenstein, from the University of Tübingen in Germany. This supports the idea that instability in different areas of behavior is characteristic of vulnerability to hypomania, they write in the journal Comprehensive Psychiatry. In an interview with 120 male students who had completed the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS), the researchers administered the FORM 90 to assess daily drinking in the 90 days prior to the interview. The participants also completed the Composite Diagnostic Interview to derive psychiatric diagnoses. Regression analyses of the data showed that, as expected, men with alcohol-related disorders drank significantly more alcohol than other men, and more frequently. When they looked at individual fluctuations in the amount of alcohol consumed, the researchers found that only men at risk for hypomania showed intra-individual fluctuations in alcohol consumption beyond the clinical diagnosis of abuse or dependency. Vulnerability for hypomania was also significantly associated with the amount of alcohol drank on each drinking day, whereas it was not associated with the number of abstinent days. This means that people scoring high on the HPS did not drink more often than did those low in risk, but when they started drinking alcohol, they drank more, say Myer and Wolkenstein. They conclude: Our results suggest that risk for hypomania is associated with a specific pattern of alcohol consumption characterized by a more variable drinking pattern and binge drinking. This association was not explained by the presence of an alcohol-related or affective disorder, so that it is unlikely just to be a symptom of them. The researchers say that this specific drinking pattern highlights instability as a core factor in vulnerability for bipolar disorder. They recommend further research into the motivational and affective processes associated with drinking alcohol and bipolar disorder to determine how mood and drinking are related. Abstract 
 Bipolar I and Its Smaller Sibling: Distinctions between I and II by Russ Federman, Ph.D. February 18, 2010 The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association is the manual guiding all psychiatric diagnosis in the United States and around the world. When DSM III transitioned to DSM IV in 1994, manic depression became bipolar disorder and the disorder became further defined into category I and category II. To meet criteria for Bipolar I an individual must have had a major depressive episode plus manic symptoms which have lasted one week, or any duration if severe enough to require hospitalization. Most readers are familiar with acute symptoms of depression: very low energy, low self-worth, low motivation, suicidal thoughts, etc. But what about mania? Mania represents a set of distinct symptoms many of which often occur together. These are: elevated, expansive or irritable mood, inflated self-esteem, increased physical energy, decreased need for sleep, racing ideas, rapid speech, distractibility, intensification of goal directed behavior and excessive involvement in pleasurable activity that has high potential for negative consequences (spending sprees, sexual indiscretions, etc.). Within the wide range of behaviors just listed some aren't that unusual and in fact may be experienced by anyone from time to time. But what truly places behavior in the realm of "mania" is the following description from DSM IV: "The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in occupational functioning or in social activities or relationships with others or to necessitate hospitalization... (Am. Psychiatric Assoc., 1994)." Essentially, as a function of mental activity that is so accelerated and/or agitated the individual no longer has the capacity to exercise good judgment, plan effectively and withstand impulsive action. The individual in the midst of mania is truly out of control. The smaller sibling of Bipolar I disorder is Bipolar II. The list of symptoms for II are the same as I, though they need be present for only 4 days instead of a week. But in contrast to Bipolar I, "the episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization (Am. Psychiatric Assoc., 1994)." The symptoms are referred to as "hypomanic" or below manic. What's important to recognize is that these are not distinctly different entities. Instead they represent two different ranges of intensity on the continuum of mood. With greater acuity and accompanying dysfunction we see more serious mental illness. With milder symptoms we still see mood variability but the individual's overall functioning usually remains intact. Generally speaking the milder symptoms of Bipolar II provide a better prognosis for longer-term stability. If the bipolar roller coaster provides a milder ride during the first several years after the diagnosis is made then the longer-term ride may indeed turn out to be smoother. Conversely if there are steep highs and lows within the first several years of the disorder, then the longer-term prognosis is not good. The ride may never smooth out; or if it does, it may not remain that way for long. So is it a safe assumption that those with Bipolar II can be more relaxed with their treatment and their continued efforts to maintain stability? Unfortunately, no. You see sometimes Bipolar II can be a precursor of Bipolar I with hypomania representing an early phase of what will eventually become Bipolar I. Let's consider an analogy from the earth sciences: sometimes an active volcano will vent smoke and ash without an accompanying volcanic eruption. In fact, the venting may actually lessen the likelihood of an eruption because underground pressure is being released. But, there are also times when venting can herald the approach of a full eruption. It's more of an indication that a big blow is brewing. Same with bipolar. During the early years of the disorder, there's no way of easily discerning Bipolar II symptoms which don't escalate from those that will progress to Bipolar I. However, if over the course of the next 10 years one's hypomania has not transitioned to full mania, then we could more safely conclude that a full eruption is unlikely. Bottom line: Individuals with Bipolar II should do everything in their power to protect against a more substantial eruption. Putting an active volcano back to sleep is no small undertaking.

 My girlfriend has bipolar,i have been dating her for 8 months but only seeing her at weekends.I had a friend when i was younger who had bipolar that died,thats my only experience of the illness. I love this woman dearly but i`m getting very tired,to me she hides in a fantasy world,she doesn`t take her meds as she says they make her a zombie,they are Prozac. She is into the whole new age thing which is fine,but it is hard for me.She talks of chatting to galactic beings,she constantly goes on about ascention,multi dimensions,atlantis,laws of attraction ect ect,some of these things have some value in psychology,but for the main i believe it is not the real world,this is where i am struggling. There is being spiritual and there is hiding from life.Can anyone help me,i don`t want to give up on her,but i`m finding that i`m getting frustrated and tired.How can i cope? 
 Guys, I am totally at my wits end and bear with me because this might be a little lengthy but if any of you have any feedback for me I would really be grateful. I am Bi-polar which manifests typically with racing thoughts and hypomania without the depression. I have had an extremely difficult time being able to sleep over the past four years and I have tried everything under the sun and the only thing that we found that ended up (usually) being able to help me sleep was Thorazine. I did not like being on it and I was originally on 500mg at night but got down to 200 which wouldnt work and 300 usually does the trick but lately (Over the past couple months) I have been having more trouble sleeping and I also saw a neuro psychologist who is also a sleep specialist and he ran an EEG which came back as being abnormal, and I have been having what I call 'micro-seizures' which coincide with my increased sleep difficulty, but I dont know if I am just being hypomanic or my brain isnt working right. Doesnt Bi-polar generally manifest in the teens and early twenties? Would it be normal to see a spike of symptoms in my early thirties? What do you guys think? HELP!!! 
 Bipolar Disorder and Physical Intimacy By Joe Kraynak, Bipolar Beat Blog February 5, 2010 A recent visitor to our Bipolar Blog wrote: I have a question, I was diagnosed BP1 in July, I am struggling with the severe manic episodes involving self damage, screaming, it is pretty bad, the police were here last night, but thanks to God, they did not take me. My boyfriend is loving and supportive and a good person is taking care of me when I come down. But the physically intimate part of our relationship is gone. He always has an excuse. This only makes me feel more and more lonely and displaced. He refuses to make the connection of normalcy for me. To me it proves he cannot handle BP. Anyone else have this problem, can you overcome it and how??? Thanks for your thoughts! ~ Lori B.Loris comment struck a chord with me. Ive been in her boyfriends shoes. During my wifes manic episodes in the past, I often felt too overwhelmed and upset by what was going on to feel a strong urge for physical intimacy. I felt constantly on the defensive. Many people describe it as having to walk on eggshells. But Lori B.s comment reminded me of the potential therapeutic aspect of physical intimacy and the brutal nature of bipolar. During the very moments when two people in a relationship need physical intimacy the most, mania can drive them apart. Knowledge and understanding may be the best defense. Realizing its bipolar at work and not your loved ones willful choice to make life difficult may help avoid some of the blame and bitterness that can drive partners further apart. In the meantime, I think maintaining a connection of normalcy can play a valuable role in the emotional and psychological well being of both partners. Withdrawing ones emotions or avoiding physical intimacy, while its an understandable reaction, rarely does any good and may function as another stressor for one or both partners. During one of our worst episodes, a very wise marriage counselor sent us home with strict instructions not to discuss any of the issues we were addressing in therapy. Our orders were to go home and enjoy one anothers company between sessions. I think she knew that as soon as the medications took effect, wed be okay as long as we didnt self-destruct before then. Best advice from a marriage counselor we ever received. I realize this topic is very broad. Ive touched only on the manic part depression brings up another side of the discussion as does medication that can adversely affect ones sex drive, performance, or both. Maybe well touch on these topics in future posts. 
 Question to all who have suffered and do suffer hypomanias, slight or otherwise. "do you experience any physical change in your body?" while hypomanic. I am one who professes to be cured of my bipolar, lol. Have not swung moods of a drastic sort for almost 3 years. Tinges, and right now I am having a tinge, of hypomania. Well my symptoms have become physical, least some of them. Top of my list is sleep disorder, which I am sure any bipolar can relate to. I have solved that problem with a prescription for Lorazepam 1mg. taken as required. I hate prescrips, but sometimes there is a need. My body needs its rest. Hardening and rapid growth of my fingernails. Now isn't this a weird one? I am sure their growth triples when i am feeling at all hypomanic. Swelling of my ankles and feet. I take a water pill, well actually a very high dosage of water pills, all the time, but i find it is totally ineffective when i am in the throes of mania. ....and at the moment, this is all that springs to mind. Anyone else who is experiencing some physical symptoms while manic, I would be interested to know. 
 Anxiety disorders can impair bipolar outcome Sept. 1, 2004 Psychiatry Matters Multiple comorbid anxiety disorders are fairly common in patients with bipolar disorder and can lead to a poor outcome, say Canadian researchers who found that the type, rather than the number, of anxiety disorders may be a key factor. "We found that an increasing number of diagnosed anxiety disorders did not predict worse outcomes for our participants. In contrast, it appeared that presence of certain anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and social phobia specifically, were more likely to be associated with negative outcomes on a variety of illness measures," explain Khrista Boylan (St Joseph's Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario) and colleagues For their study, the researchers used structured clinical interviews to determine the rates of GAD, panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder in 138 patients with bipolar disorder. The impact of one or more comorbid anxiety disorders on mood symptoms and general functioning was then evaluated over a 3-year period. Over half (55.8%) of the participants had an anxiety disorder, and close to one third (31.9%) had multiple anxiety disorders. The results showed that patients with comorbid anxiety disorders had an earlier age at onset of illness, had more depressive symptoms, spent a significantly greater proportion of the year ill, and tended to have lower Global Assessment of Functioning scores than bipolar patients without an anxiety disorder. There was also the tendency for anxiety disorders to be associated with a rapid cycling course of bipolar illness. The researchers report in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry that, with regard to negative outcomes, the number of anxiety disorders was found to be less important than the type, with GAD and social phobia having the most negative impact. "It is obviously important clinically to screen for and treat anxiety disorders in patients with bipolar disorder," Boylan and team conclude. "Future studies will need to focus on optimal pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches to treating these comorbid conditions as there are few data describing the best management of any anxiety disorder in a patient with bipolar illness." J Clin Psychiatry 2004; 65: 1106-1113 
 A freind of mine recently revealed to me on the phone that he has BPD, though he insists the 'D' part of that be dropped. He doesn't think of himself as having a 'disorder'. The problem I have with his revelation is that he's self-diagnosing. Is it considered 'ok' for someone to determine for themselves and in absence of any clinical workup or medical doctors input, just decide they are Bi-Polar and also be right? I guess I have some angst about him doing this, because I think it takes a trained professional, who understands these things from an academic and experiential perpsective, to make a diagnosis about an individual, not themselves. When I asked if maybe sometime down the road he'd get a doctors opinion he said,"What for?! I've read all the symptoms on the BPD site and I fit them. Why go pay someone 150 bucks for what I've figured out on my own for free?" I said,"Well, you're not just Bi-Polar, you're cheap too." j/k-ing, I didn't really say that to him. His medicine is not prescribed. He smokes pot and says that it helps his depression. He doesn't 'wake and bake' or hit the stuff heavy, he says just enough to keep the depression at bay and that it works for him and he feels better using a natural plant than something synthetic that often has to go through a lot of troubleshooting before it's gotten right. I don't pass judgement on people who smoke weed and if he says it helps, so be it. But I had another freind who was BPD and when she smoked pot, it did help her depression - up to a point. Because if she didn't have any the next day - WHOOMP! Down she went. I wish there were some way I could convince my friend that it would be better to get his own diagnosis confirmed by someone who's ACTUALLY trained and educated to do that! lol 
 What’s the Difference Between Depression and Manic Depression? By John M. Grohol, Psy.D. October 1, 2009 Sometimes people are confused about the differences between clinical depression and manic depression. And it’s no wonder — they both have the word “depression” in their names. That’s one of the reason’s manic depression’s clinical name changed to “bipolar disorder” many years ago, to more clearly distinguish it from regular depression. The difference is really quite simple, though. Manic depression — or bipolar disorder — includes clinical depression as a part of its diagnosis. You can’t have bipolar disorder without also having had an episode of clinical depression. That’s why the two disorders shared similar names for many years, because they both include the component of clinical depression. Such a depressive episode is characterized by the common signs and symptoms of depression: Feeling sad and unhappy for an uninterrupted period of at least 2 weeksCrying for no reasonFeeling worthlessHaving very little energyLosing interest in pleasurable activities Because both depression and bipolar disorder share this commonality, somewhere between 10 to 25 percent of people with bipolar disorder are first mistakenly diagnosed with only depression. It’s only when the professional learns more about the person and their history do they later discover episodes of either mania or hypomania. Mania Distinguishes Manic Depression from Depression Mania is the distinguishing symptom of bipolar disorder and what differentiates it from clinical depression. A person with bipolar disorder has experienced one or more manic episodes (or a lesser form of mania known as hypomania). What’s a manic episode? Feeling overly happy, excited or confidentFeeling extremely irritable, aggressive and “wired”Having uncontrollable racing thoughts or speechThinking of yourself as overly important, gifted or specialMaking poor judgments, such as with money, relationships or gamblingEngaging in risky behavior or taking more risks than you ordinarily would A person with is experiencing the lesser form of mania — hypomania — may only experience a few of these symptoms, or their symptoms are far less severe and life-impairing. A person with clinical depression experiences none of these symptoms. Depression isn’t the only disorder that is confused with bipolar disorder. Especially in children and teens, sometimes other disorders — such as attention deficit disorder (ADHD) — may be misdiagnosed, when the teen may instead be suffering from a form of bipolar disorder. That’s because children and teens with bipolar disorder may display hyperactive behavior — a common symptom of ADHD. Teens with bipolar disorder are especially more likely to engage in antisocial or risky behaviors, such as those involving sex, alcohol, or drugs. People who are diagnosed with the more severe form of bipolar disorder are said to have Type I Bipolar Disorder. Those diagnosed with the less severe form — those who have hypomanic instead of full blown manic episodes — are said to have Type II. Learn more about the different types of bipolar disorder here. Bipolar disorder, like all mental disorders, is treatable through a combination of psychotherapy and medications. You can learn more about the treatment options available for bipolar disorder here. 
 Signs of Bipolar Disorder in Teens and Young Adults by Goura Fotadar November 2, 2007 Recently, we've covered stories on bipolar disorder in youth. With the rise in the number of teens diagnosed, it's important to know what signs to look for. But as the story which recently appeared in The San Diego Union-Tribune points out, knowing the signs may not be enough. The problem is that many parents notice abnormal behavior in their children but chalk it up to an "adolescent or teenage phase" that will pass. And though this may be the case for most teens, for the best possible prognosis, those suffering from mental illness should be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. The story gives the examples of two teens who were diagnosed only after one became suicidal and the other was hospitalized because of a psychiatric breakdown. The second teen wished she had been diagnosed sooner, stating, "...parents should really try to get to know their child. Ask how they feel about themsel(ves) and the world. Ask them about their hopes and dreams... Nobody asked me, but if they would have, I'd have told them I wanted to live on the planet Pluto with nobody around me." "Although some children have vague symptoms at age 10 to 12, the signs of bipolar disorder, severe depression and schizophrenia usually draw attention and peak at 17 to 22, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Mental health experts believe that this unfortunate timing is triggered by changes in the brain. However, it also may be exacerbated by stress."Some signs to watch out for (if you notice any of these for extended periods of time, ask your child about them): "Increased isolation and social withdrawal. Children may lock themselves in their rooms and not spend as much time as they used to with friends and family.""Severe overreaction to a situation, such as sobbing over one bad grade or screaming at someone who took a desired seat.""Extreme indifference and lack of motivation.""Severe anxiety or fearfulness.""Deteriorating grades or job performance. This change will be noticeable, because the majority of children who have mental disorders are very bright and good students.""Sleeping too little or too much.""Excessive drinking or drug use." This is often something that parents notice but don't correlate with mental illness. It's important to stress that though not all children abusing drugs are suffering from mental illness, drug abuse is a risk factor and sometimes the result of suffering from mental illness. As mentioned in the story, drugs are often a method of self-medication for the mentally ill.

 Types of Bipolar Disorder Bipolar Chick Blog Sunday, March 15th, 2009 The bipolar classifications in this post are loosely paraphrased from the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) published by the American Psychiatric Association, research by the National Institute of Mental Health, and interviews with leading bipolar experts. Bipolar I This is the most severe type of bipolar disorder and the classic type. A diagnosis of Bipolar I requires at least one full-blown manic episode some time during a per-sons life that doctors cannot attribute to another cause, such as a medication or substance abuse. The manic episode must last at least one week, or be serious enough to require hospitalization or cause functional impairment in some aspect of a persons life (marriage, career, finances, etc.). Interestingly, a major depressive episode is not required to be diagnosed with this form of bipolar disorder, but it is almost always present and usually even much more common than the manic episodes. Bipolar II Most experts agree that there are versions of bipolar disorder that dont produce full mania, yet respond very well to mood-stabilizing medications. People whose symptoms fit this category are often diagnosed with Bipolar II, sometimes called soft bipolar. According to Dr. Ghaemi, the primary difference between Bipolar I and Bipolar II is that the manic symptoms of the latter are not severe enough to cause functional impairment. With Bipolar II, the sufferer wont become so grandiose that he or she loses his job, says Dr. Ghaemi. They will be much more active than normal, but they wont have problems due to those activities. To be diagnosed with Bipolar II, a person must experience at least one major depressive episode that doctors cant attribute to another cause and at least one episode of hypomania during his or her lifetime. People with Bipolar II never experience a full-blown manic episode. If they do, their diagnosis would likely be upgraded to Bipolar I. Again, usually there are many more depressive than hypomanic episodes. Cyclothymic Disorder Sometimes called bipolar lite, this diagnosis requires multiple depressive and hypomanic episodes not extreme enough to warrant a diagnosis of Bipolar I or II. In some cases, depression and mania occur simultaneously, resulting in a state of chronic irritability. A persons symptoms must last for at least two years with no more than two months of stable mood during that time. Some people with Cyclothymic disorder go on to develop a full-blown mixed or depressive episode, which usually leads doctors to upgrade their diagnosis to Bipolar I or II. Usually these symptoms are so mild that persons with this condition do not seek treatment. This variety can be seen as the personality manifestation of bipolar disorder in some people. If symptoms are severe enough to cause problems, then Cyclothymia usually is not the diagnosis, but rather type I or type II Bipolar Disorder. Bipolar NOS (Not Otherwise Specified) This form of bipolar requires manic or depressive episodes that doctors cant categorize as unipolar depression. The episodes also cant fit into any of the other bipolar categories. The Bipolar NOS label often applies in the following circumstances: Rapid mood fluctuations intense enough to qualify as manic, hypomanic, or depressive, but that dont meet the duration requirements for a Bipolar I, Bipolar II, or Cyclothymic disorder diagnosisHypomania without depressionMania or Cyclothymic disorder that occurs simultaneously with schizophrenia, psychotic disorder NOS, or delusional disorder (a disorder characterized by psychoses, hallucinations, and delusional thinking)Chronic depression or dysthymia (long-term, low-level depression) accompanied by hypomanic episodes. Dr. Ghaemi suggests that this category also be used for persons with recurrent severe depression (but no clear hypomania) who also experience manic or hypomanic periods only with antidepressant use, or who have family members diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Rapid-Cycling Rapid-cycling isnt a separate type of bipolar disorder; it is a descriptor of the course of bp. It is more common in women than in men. To qualify as rapid-cycling, a person must experience four or more episodes (depression, mania, hypomania, or mixed state) in a year. The episodes must be full-blown and, in the case of mania or mixed state, last at least one week or result in hospitalization. A depression must last at least two weeks and a persons hypomania must last at least four days. This term does NOT mean that ones moods fluctuate on a day by day, or hour by hour basis. Such short-term mood shifts are common in mania and mixed episodes, and are not themselves diagnostic of anything. Major Depressive Episode To have a major depressive episode, a person must have five or more of the following symptoms that last for at least two weeks: Depressed mood-feeling hopeless, sad, discouraged, or emptyMarkedly diminished interest in activities previously considered pleasurable, including sexA decrease or increase in appetite that lasts for two weeksSleeping too much or too littleMoving uncharacteristically slowly, both in mind and bodyFatigueFeelings of worthlessness, excessive guilt, or inappropriate guiltUncharacteristic indecisiveness or diminished ability to think clearly or concentrate on a given taskRecurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Any of the following can disqualify the episode from reaching major depression status: Something terrible happened before a person became depressed, such as the death of a loved one, a divorce, or a job loss. (In other words, the person has a good reason to feel depressed.)A person is dealing with substance abuse, such as heavy drinking.The depression is a component of a mixed episode. Manic Episode A manic episode isnt official unless it lasts for at least one week or requires hospitalization. The episode also must be characterized by an abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. In order to qualify as a bona fide manic episode, the mania must be severe enough to cause harm to some aspect of a persons life, such as their interpersonal relationships, job, or physical functioning. The mania also must not be substance-induced. Three of the following symptoms must also be present during the week; four if a persons mood is irritable rather than euphoric. Euphoric mood, feeling high, or excessively optimisticInflated self-importance or grandiosityExtreme irritability, exhibiting behavior that is aggressive, provocative, or intrusiveDecreased need for sleep (feeling well-rested after just a few hours of sleep)Extremely talkative and sociable, pressure to keep talkingIncreased activityRacing thoughtsInability to concentrateEasily distracted by insignificant external stimuliSignificant increase in goal-directed activity or significant speeding up of thoughts and physical movement (such as planning to remodel the kitchen in less than a week, or moving on a whim to Nashville to become a country singer)Excessive involvement in risky, potentially self-destructive activities, including sexual indiscretions, gambling, unrestrained shopping sprees, and investments in pyramid schemesImpaired judgment, i.e., no perception that the mood and behaviors are abnormal. Dr. Ghaemi notes that about 25 percent of patients with manic episodes have classic impulsive sexual or spending behaviors. Thus, the absence of those behaviors does not rule out bipolar disorder. Further, only about 25 percent of patients with manic episodes have euphoric mood; the majority have depressed or irritable mood. Thus, the absence of euphoria also does not rule out mania. Hypomanic Episode Hypomania is a less-intense mania that doesnt last as long as a full-blown mania and doesnt cause significant problems with interpersonal relationships or ones job. Hypomania may feel good to the person who experiences it and may even be associated with good functioning and enhanced productivity. A persons mood must be elevated above his or her normal state and display characteristics that others believe are slightly out of character for the person. The episode must last at least four days. Hypomania presents in two forms-euphoric and dysphoric-and can last for a few hours or several weeks. According to Jim Phelps, MD, an Oregon-based psychiatrist and author of Why Am I Still Depressed? Recognizing and Managing the Ups and Downs of Bipolar II and Soft Bipolar Disorder, euphoric hypomania feels good and is sometimes productive, but dysphoric hypomania produces irritability, impulsiveness, uncontrollable temper, and impaired judgment. The hypomania frequently alternates with episodes of depression; it almost always accompanies mood instability. Mixed Manic Episode Mixed states are found in Bipolar I, Bipolar II, and Bipolar spectrum disorders. They are more common in women and are often associated with thyroid abnormalities, lack of response to lithium (the standard treatment for Bipolar I disorder), and antidepressant-induced worsening of symptoms. To qualify, an episode must simultaneously meet the requirements stipulated for a major depressive episode and a manic episode. A persons symptoms must occur nearly every day for a week straight. Diagnosis of mixed states is most likely to be made after a patient fails to respond to outpatient treatment, or becomes worse on antidepressant medications and is subsequently admitted to the hospital for closer observation. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is common, leading to delays in effective treatment and a higher risk of suicide. Thus, any depressed patient should be carefully assessed for manic symptoms too: they could be suffering from a mixed episode in disguise. Psychosis This can accompany depression or mania, but is not required to receive a bipolar diagnosis. Psychosis is marked by delusional thinking, paranoia, and visual or auditory hallucinations. It can accompany either an extremely high or extremely low mood episode. The extremes of depression and, more often, mania can shock the mind to such a degree that it begins to experience self-destructive or grandiose beliefs, becomes obsessed with fears that have no basis in reality, or sees or hears things that are not real. Although psychosis sounds dramatic and easily identifiable, it can be subtle and blended with enough reality to make psychotic seem more like unusually perceptive. It can include: A person thinks he or she has special powers.They hear voices that other people cant.They believe that people can read their mind.They think that the television or radio is sending them special messages.They believe people are following them or trying to harm them when theyre not.They believe that they can accomplish things that they cant.They believe they are someone they are not-like God or a famous person in history. Suicide Some people with bipolar disorder become suicidal. Risk for suicide appears to be higher earlier in the course of the illness. Therefore, recognizing bipolar disorder early and learning how best to manage it may decrease the risk of death by suicide. Signs and symptoms that may accompany suicidal feelings include: Talking about feeling suicidal or wanting to dieFeeling hopeless, believing that nothing will ever change or get betterFeeling helpless, believing that nothing one does makes any differenceFeeling like a burden to family and friendsAbusing alcohol or drugsPutting affairs in order (such as organizing finances or giving away possessions to prepare for ones death)Writing a suicide notePutting oneself in harms way, or in situations where there is a danger of being killed. Suicide risk is highest with mixed episodes, followed by major depressive episodes, but suicide is relatively uncommon in pure manic episodes. Lithium has been shown to prevent suicide based on relatively strong evidence, according to Dr. Ghaemi, a major benefit that has not been consistently shown for any other psychotropic medication (in particular antidepressants). 
 Smoking Tied to Suicide Risk in Bipolar Disorder November 11, 2009 NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - People with bipolar disorder who smoke appear to have a heightened risk of suicidal behavior -- possibly because they are generally prone to impulsive acts, a new study suggests. Bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression, is marked by dramatic swings in mood -- ranging from episodes of debilitating depression to periods of euphoric recklessness. Previous studies have found that bipolar patients who smoke have a higher suicide risk than their non-smoking counterparts, but the reasons have not been clear. The new findings suggest that high levels of impulsivity -- one of the symptoms of bipolar disorder -- may draw some patients to both smoking and suicidal behavior. Dr. Michael J. Ostacher and colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston found that among 116 bipolar patients they followed, current smokers generally scored higher on a standard measure of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Moreover, smokers were more likely to make a suicide attempt over the next nine months, the researchers report in the journal Bipolar Disorders. Five of the 31 smokers in the study (16 percent) attempted suicide during the study period. By comparison, only 3 of 85 non-smokers (3.5 percent) attempted suicide during the study. The researchers also used a standard questionnaire to gauge patients' impulsiveness -- such as how often they speak or act without thinking and how well they plan for the future. When those scores were factored in, the link between smoking and suicidal behavior diminished. The implication, according to Ostacher's team, is that high levels of impulsivity partly explain why smokers were at greater risk. From a practical standpoint, the researchers write, the findings add more evidence that smoking can be considered a "clinical marker" of higher suicide risk in bipolar patients. Smoking, in and of itself, may not be a strong predictor of patients' suicide odds, but doctors can still consider it as part of a comprehensive patient assessment, the researchers suggest. It is unknown, they note, whether helping bipolar patients quit smoking would have any effect on their risk of suicidal behavior.

 The jury is still out on this topic for me. After 2 full years of lamictal(mood stabilizer) treatment,,,,and somewhat regular appointments with a psychiatrist (bit of cognitive therapy), and no mood swings whatsoever, I suggested to my doc that I discontinue the medication. He agreed I could try it, so we put me through a weaning process. By April of 2009 i was drug fee. Since that time I have suffered the occasional blue period,,,,and just recently i seem to be having a few symptoms of hypomania. My sleep seems a bit disrupted and i have more energy, accomplishing much more. I certainly am talking more, anxious to be very helpful to anyone who needs it. Its all good I figure, as long as i don't go overboard with my beer consumption, I have decided I will not worry about it. I have concluded that my brain problems have stemmed from a severe consussion that I received in an auto accident in 1983. Having been caused from a physical reason, maybe I have healed. Maybe my brain has learned how to balance itself out. Over the years of having this illness i have adopted many strategies to help cope. There was indeed "method" to my madness I am hoping these little hypomania symptoms i am experiencing will just tie in nicely with the Christmas season and give me the little extra boost of energy and good feeling needed to help me celebrate a nice holiday this year. I hope i have this right, and my form of bipolar, for the most part, has been healed. Mare 
 -- Life as a Bipolar Definition of Bipolar Disorder Bilpolar disorder: A mood disorder sometimes called manic-depressive illness or manic-depression that characteristically involves cycles of depression and elation or mania. Sometimes the mood switches from high to low and back again are dramatic and rapid, but more often they are gradual and slow, and intervals of normal mood may occur between the high (manic) and low (depressive) phases of the condition. The symptoms of both depressive and manic cycles may be severe and often lead to impaired functioning. A pretty basic definition I discovered on the internet, Net Medicine site, not sure of the credentials behind it, but most definitions you read are similar, this one catching the basic gist of things to a tee. Now to the average Joe this means a whole lot of nothing, maybe to someone writing a psychology paper, doctor, or some other medical professional...but the most interested party is the sufferer, myself, who has read and reread this, until it was ingrained on my brain...shaking my head wondering what and why is this happening to me? Someone stop this rollercoaster, I wanna get off. Life with a mental disorder is one of the most misunderstood events a person could have to deal with. Lack of medical knowledge about the brain, our bodies central computer system, with all its intricate little neurons and synapses, that are back firing when messages are launched, causing havoc that no one can identify nevermind understand. The overall behavior patterns that result range from ohhhhh really distressing to friggin disasterous. Bipolar disorder...was my diagnoses, as well as Borderline, but thats a whole nuther issue, was back in 2000 I think. Time has kinda melded together for me, a symptom of my hell so they say, and it is easier, soooo much easier for your mind to accept that it is part of your condition, as well as the rest of your irractic behavior. But that doesn't make things any easier, figuring out why you are doing the things you do, doesn't make it any easier at all. All you can do is hope and pray that it will end, did i say end? No, sorry it doesn't end, control is the word i should be using...controlled enough so you can function with some sort of semblance to your life. I write this story for all bipolar sufferers, exposing my off the map behavior, my grief, my pain...to better help you understand some of this wretched disease, to try to inform you and your families, your friends, lovers and mates, that you really aren't looney, that the real person you have always been is tucked away inside, screaming to get out. I write this story for my own personal therapy, thinking i can better come to terms with some of results that have occurred in my life because of bipolar, and maybe, just maybe, if i document them, see them in print, then set them on fire to watch them burn, well maybe they will be gone from my mind forever****sigh, i wish that could be true. If in trying to describe what went on in my brain and is still going on to some degree, can help a teensy weensy bit in some bipolar's life, then it has all been worth it, and "my" therapy may be part of yours. I'm not quite sure where to begin, and i do tend to ramble, this i don't know if i can blame on bipolar or not, i may have always been a rambler. You see, that is indeed one of the most distressing parts of the disorder... you totally lose track of who you are or were, so determining the here and the now, indeed becomes confusing. As far as i can remember, my first panic attack was my beginning. A bipolar panic attack, is kind of a separate entity from the manias and depressions, but another affliction of this disease for some, ahhhhh probably most at one point anyhow. It comes with a whole package of physical side affects. Sweating palms, heart thumping in your chest, thoughts jumbling in your head, rapid speech, so rapid the simple process of expressing thoughts becomes an unreachable task. To sum it up, I thought I was having a heart attack or something else life threatening. I can remember washing dishes at the kitchen sink, 1999 or maybe 2000, and this episode of all the above mentioned symptoms struck me with a force. Seeking help, I went out to the garage to beg my husband's assistance. Yes, at one point in my life i was married, and had quite a normal life, three bedroom home, two sons and a cat, never was a dog person. I was totally lost on how to explain what I was feeling. We had words earlier, anger that i am sure was mood disorder related, but heck, I didn't know that, my disorder had been creeping in for some time, i guess. Now my husband was not a man to understand emotion, especially emotion that had gone astray. Lack of communication was a constant issue in our marriage, my disease might have been part to blame. I was in tears of course, and I get a bit hyper when emotionally overwrought. My husband becomes more distant. I was probably starting to lose my temper and shout at him by this time. I was really scared and he couldn't understand. He could offer nothing to help me through this crisis. Closeness had also become a thing of our past, another bipolar effect? Damn who knew. Overall my marriage had already been deteriorating, bipolar may have been the tip of the iceberg. Anyhow it was Sunday and my own doc, a wonderful man wasn't available. At this point, I just wanted someone to take me out to the pasture and shoot me like an old horse, put me out of my misery...the unknown creates such fear. My husband had offered me a run to the emergency, but the idea of sitting there for hours and getting no where, was not at all appealing to me. But I knew I needed someone's help. My husband convinced me that a call to the local crisis center was our last option. I thought their services were for suicidal people....and I certainly wasn't that, but i agreed to a call. Soooo, husband contacted someone for me and we began to chat. Being crisis, their first question was "are you suicidal" of which i confidently could answer NO, i was not...i was very, very scared. After chatting to Kathy for 15 or 20 minutes, i became calmer and I was able to regain control of my mind and body. She made a date to come by and see me within the next couple of days, to offer me whatever services and a wisp of understanding into what the heck may be happening to me. The date came and went, and Kathy was a really nice gal, but i was still totally in the dark as to what was going on in my brain. What and why is this happening to me? ...and this is the million dollar question. After consult with my family doctor and him replying "this is not my field Mary-Anne, I will have to refer you to a psychiatrist" . I respected that, I trust this man with my life. He had an inkling of what was happening and he knew my situation required drugs he was not capable of prescribing. This man has seen me thru thick and thin. OK cool,,,,I was gonna go to the horse's mouth right? Only trouble is, I live in Thunder Bay, northern Ontario...where psychiatrists are not a dime a dozen...the wait list was 6 - 9 months long. Sheesh...I had to hang on. Was me and my computer til then...research, read, websites, worry, fret and wonder. I did find out that mental disorders are primarily genetic and if you have a family history of nucking futs, chances are you may also be. I queried my mom, the staunch Brit she was, immediately denied loonies in her family. Now my dad's side, big bunch of drunken Frenchmen, who knows what may have been cooking there. i couldn't ask, he had died years ealier. Mom assured me that this could not have been a genetic thing. Physical trauma was also a contributing factor and ahaah, I had suffered a severe concussion back in 1983, automobile accident, that to this day, I believe was the root of my new evil. I am thinking the reason it didn't surface for such a long time, was because my life was busy...it was full. I had returned to work after my accident, I had married and moved to an old farmhouse in the country ( i mean old...outhouse and all). We had dreams of building our dream house, by cash of course. Gave birth to two premature sons, another big trauma. One was only 3.5 pounds at birth, the second was 6.6, i did improve somewhat on my gestation. Survived a marital separation, reunion, move to town, re-education and return to work. The whole time recovering from a brain injury that believe you me, took at least 10 years of my life. A lot of miserable and painful years. Yes, my life was busy and the lives of my husband and children was contingent to me being in control. I was needed and needed badly. There was no time for me to be weak. Don't get me wrong, I am sure I did not live mood disorder free, was prescribed anti-depressants a few time by my gp, both of us thinking I was still recovering adverse affects from my brain injury....but ke sera,sera...what will be will be. Where the heck this friggin disease came from, was not my most important focal point...diagnosing and getting help for it, was. And the answer is...hey, what was the question? Tick tock tick tock...weeks pass by, months pass by and one day I hear from my doc. He wants to know if I will consent to be part of a new satellite doctoring scheme. If the shrink happened to be in town, he was from Hamilton, Ontario, on the day of your appointment you would see him face to face, other wise my diagnoses would be done by TV...how novel. As luck would have it...I got to meet this doc face to face. I must admit I was not entirely impressed with this guy, but hell beggars can't be choosers, right? He was kind of a weasel in the looks department, strike one, and he kept trying to dig up skeletons from my past. Claiming my disorder was happening because I came from a pretty poor family and my father was a drunk. i assured him that I had come to terms with my past and they were not at all the reason for my mood swinging from euphoric to very down without any rhyme nor reason whatsoever. You see from the research I had done, I knew exactly what i was going through. I had all the symptoms to a tee. I didn't need a medical degree to see this. I needed his diagnoses and a prescription to balance out the ping ponging chemicals in my brain. Well after an hour or so of laying things on the line with this Doc, i walked out of the psych ward of the local hospital...my prescription for lithium, a mood stabilizer, and luvox, an anti-depressant, in hand. And life goes on...in a perfect world, maybe... Now I have the drugs that I need and believe truly that I am going to be fine...I can't remember if that were my case or not. Maybe i was fine for a while...we probably had to fiddle with the doseage, several times, you see finding the right drug cocktail mix is crucial to proper brain function of anyone with mood disorder. I have a medicine cabinet full of castoffs, drugs that just didn't work for me or the side affects were just too extreme. You really start to feel like a medical guinea pig, it gets kind of depressing, sheeesh my down side is peeking in. My doc did tell me to expect some side affects and to decide whether these side affects outweighed the benefit the drug had on my brain, in other words, put up with them. Side effects for me always ranged from sleep disorders, dry mouth, upset bowel function, poor memory and eventually a feeling of total disassociation with my body, almost as though I were looking in on myself. Not too plleasant but hey, my mood wasn't swinging right? So things rolled on for a while and like I say no mood swings...but, but, I felt dead. I had no desire for anything besides survival. My family thought I was fine. I was functioning, doing what was required of me. Getting up in the mornings, going through the motions, work was manageable, life moved forward, but things for me were just too meaningless. I missed the euphoria of my manias. That being one of the biggest dangers to a bipolar. So like all naughty bipolars and kinda against the advice of my doctor, my gp, I had no therapist to help me deal. I gave up the drugs for a while, cripes they we making me a zombie. My doc had warned me I would be thrust in to a manic phase and asked me if my family were prepared for that. I agreed to return to the drugs if things got to out of control. So I discontinued the meds and surprise, surprise, I was almost immediately thrown into the euphoric state of mania... Let me try to describe mania to you... I am out on an errand, driving down Memorial Avenue and this super big smile breaks across my face. I feel wonderful, I love the world and all that comes with it. No warning, just happens, like I am a chosen one...wow, it is such a grand feeling of elation. The door has opened, I enter mania. I have got thoughts racing through my head, music stirs within my soul deeper than ever, just can't get enough. I become more talkative, far more, and in my opinion much more brilliant. I can dicuss anything from occupying toddlers to current world politics, one in the same to me. Quite a variety, depending on my company. "Company" human contact, that is something you need, like desperately need, urgently crave and deeply desire. Gawd, You can't possibly do without it, or you will indeed perish. Now that is where my trouble came in. I wasn't getting the company I needed at home, although I stressed the importance of it to my family and to bear with me...but they just didn't get it. I guess they tried, and I can't fault them. This was not something easy for myself to understand, nevermind them. With mental disorders, as the cliche goes,,,you really have to be there. I wasn't getting my social needs satisfied at home....so I started to go out. i asked my husband to accompany me many times at first, and him being a homebody had no desire. I really don't understand how our marriage survived as long as it did. On my own again. Soooo, I soon got very tired of his rejection, I went out myself. And what better place to go to socialize than your local bar. People, laughter, dancing...just what the doctor ordered, in my mind. Now another big symptom of bipolar is alcohol consumption. Not a problem actually, I became very good at it. Your body is so wired, tis kind of like a cocaine buzz...yes i will admit it, I have tried cocaine twice in my life...and you know i kind of did enjoy it. but i knew it was not a path I wished to travel. Anyhow bipolars can consume staggering amounts of beer before they become drunk...and of course you have no recollection of being drunk. You are at a bar...who cares if you are drunk, you fit right in. You see, I was having fun and my actions weren't hurting anyone,,,were they? i was feeding my mania exactly what it needed. My outings got more frequent and i would stay out later and later...sneaking in quietly sometimes as the sun was rising. Hey, did I mention promiscuity is a symptom of mania. i am too ashamed and embarassed even to admit where that took me. Even if my marriage was on the rocks I was still married. I was compromising morals and values that I held high. Can't say i was entirely proud of my behavior but it was something I just had to do...hey try to wrap your mind around that one...all bipolars could I bet, its the self medicating process. Anyone else would assume it was an addiction...which of sorts it was....but they would be thinking you were a plain old alcoholic. Alcoholism not being an addiction held in high esteem, they would be shaking their heads thinking "come on eh, get your act together" It was something i was hearing from those close to me over and over. One of the saddest moments in my life was when my 21 year old son, thru his tears, was begging me to stop drinking, stop killing myself and I just couldn't do it. Bipolar was ruining my mind, this disease was taking over my life. The alcohol was necessary at this time, I thought. Damn, it was my answer to lessening the pain of my illness...i am ill, can't anybody understand that? Yep, I had the wonderful excuse that my alcohol addiction was due to my bipolar, what the heck i was nuts anyhow, right? and I badly needed an excuse to justify the mess I was making of my life. You see mr. booze was indeed my self medicator. When i was feeling anxious, not quite a panic attack, but close to it, the more I drank. Alcohol being a depressant, it would calm me. Good old alcohol it made me feel better.. cigarettes helped too, they have that glorious calming effect when you smoke one, but it isn't long after you butted it out your body is looking for more of the same. i would sit in front of the computer and drink a dozen beer and smoke a pack of smokes. And I thought it was the least of my worries. After realizing i couldn't carry on being a gad-about, drinking beer and partying up around town, I once again turned to the computer. The internet became my be all, end all. I didn't have to leave my home, didn't have to face the inconvenience of picking up my car in the mornings and I was getting tired of the whole scene anyhow. I had figured out that these people didn't care about me, I was just another bar fly...i needed to be cared for. Romantically loved, something my marriage lacked badly. Hey do you know about the wonders of meeting people on line? They say in todays modern world one in eight relationships begin in cyberland. Thats where my next bipolar addiction took me. A whole new world at my finger tips. And in the mean time... This story takes place over a good eight year span and like I have said bipolars and time and memory are a total mess. When you add in the factor of age it is hopeless. List lady I have become. I carry a notebook with me at most times, unless i forget it, haha and anything my mind deemed important, i would write it down. It works pretty good and to this day, I resort to it somethimes. One of the coping strategies I have been forced to develop to deal with this illness. I had been back to the doc several times, put on new drugs..saw new therapists and psyciatrists, but this is Thunder Bay and seemed as soon as I found a therapist i could relate to, they packed up and moved their practice on me. Bigger and better things for them, leaving me in a lurch. Once again, Thunder Bay, really nice city if you don't need health care services. Somehow we make due. All i really had was hope in new drugs and I hated taking the drugs and having that as my only hope. Lithium eventually messed my liver, I was sure the beer I was drinking didn't help either. Was hospitalized for severe edema and my liver was diagnosed as having had suffered somewhat, but not enuff to cause me alarm. My bipolar was my main concern. You see i felt that if i could deal with this, mylife and my health would all fall into place. And maybe rightly so. Depakote was another mood stabilizer they had me try...this one gave me ovarian cysts. Which for three years I had monitored by ultrasound at 3 and 6 month intervals. All you ladies know what an internal ultrasound involves and to top it off my tech was a guy I went to high school with. I was given Ativan for my anxiety attacks, an addictive drug...but I only took as required when beer couldn't calm me. and a multitude of anti-depressants. Because I was having so much trouble finding a stabilizer drug, my mood was still swinging. Up and down, round and round...it was such a tiresome ordeal. This ride from hell, will it ever end. I just want my life back. Puuuuuhleeeease, won't somebody allow me that? Depression was the down side of things...it sucks big time Its hard for me to even go here, has me in tears when I think about the lonely days and nites I spent, by myself thinking that the world, my family, all who had put up with my moods...would be so much better off without me to worry about, wouldn't they? I am lucky, these funks, as I called them, only made me feel slightly suicidal. For some i am told coping is very, very difficult. I had my sons to think about, my wonderful, beautiful boys. They are my world...of all that I have done with my life, yes, they are my greatest contribution to this world of ours. They make me proud and I smile every time I think of them. I tried so hard to keep them informed of what I was going through and they in turn tried so hard to understand. But it was a no win situation. But honestly, they kept me going. Them and my job...i was so lucky i was able to do my job, otherwise I would have had no reason to get out of bed in the mornings...and I probably wouldn't have. When I was depressed I seemed semi normal...my sons believed they had their mom back. I functioned to the best of my abilities, kinda. They had no idea of the pain i was feeling inside, the lonliness and despair. Just how hard it was for me to crawl out of bed in the mornings and why? Was it worth facing another day? Why do I have to do this anyhow. Very hard to be you, very confusing and very undesireable. I lost all contact with people. I hated it when the phone rang, scared to answer, it might be for me. i would have to talk to somebody, no way, I couldn't do that and hell, I sure didn't want to try. Talk about your self confindence taking a vacation, mine had deserted the scene. My only escape became reading, you can get totally lost in that, don't yah know. One year my depression lasted nine months...and i was taking my drugs, doing what i was medically advised...was this what my life had amounted to. That nine month period, I must have read over 200 novels and funny thing is, i don't remember doing a whole lot more that year. Even my internet cronies were put on the back burner. You see I only need contact when I felt good,,,when i was down, being with people, I didn't need, cripes I could hardly even tolerate. This was not how I wanted my life to be. i give kudos to a chat room I found on the net in 2002. "Mixed Nuts " its called. Appropriate eh? A room for people with mood disorders, a room where people collect to chat. They come for a bit, some become quite regular. Guess I am considered an old timer there. All who come have some form or another of mental illness. Coming to have questions answered and to receive support from people who have been there and know and understand what its all about. More so than any doctors, psyciatrists, therapist I have seen thoughout this illness, these people have helped me immeasurably, they have become my friends. People from all over the world and every walk of life. Letting me know, that I am not alone. They have helped alot in my ability to carry on. Yes, depression truly sucks. And to sum things up...in a nutshell I dream about a normal life...but it has gotten to a point where I haven't a clue what that means. I feel kinda like me these days, I am level, not swinging moods. I am happy...am I me? the person i stuggled for so long to get back too? Life has come so far and so much has changed...maybe I am me. Whatever, life as a bipolar is an errrrr interesting experience i can honestly admit. It is lonely, it is sorrowful, it is desperate, but it can also be up-lifting, if you can relate to that at all. I am damn mad i am bipolar, but i am very happy, i think I have conquered it. I have found a drug that works for me. Bipolar no longer rules my life! and hopefully will not, for evermore. Mary-Anne 
 For those of you who read my threads/posts, you know that I am on new medication and trying to incorporate positive changes into my life. It would have been 2 weeks this Thurs. that I felt normal. I F/U 'd today and I don't know why. I got my E.I. today - my sister took me this morning to get a few things and also to my appt. at THEO BC, which is an agency that helps people with disabilities obtain and keep employment. Everything was really good - too good - I felt very energized and jittery, and I don't know why. The guy I saw was really nice, my sister was great - I even stopped into a store I had applied at for a job to see the manager and spoke to her for a few minutes before my appt at THEO. So my confidence is up, my mood is up. At my appt. at Theo, I started to "tear up". I felt very UP and GOOD so I don't know what brought on the tears. He was very nice and understanding and even though I had tears, I still joked with him. I am so fu......d. After the appt. my sister took me home and we had coffee and she left. So what did I do? I took Tina for a walk to the liquor store and got a big bottle of wine - not because of a craving, just because I wanted it. (I have not had any alcohol in about 6 weeks and I am a self-diagnosed binge drinker.) I wanted to change my mood and test myself. Trust me - the 16.00 I spent on the wine is much needed for food and bus fare, but I dismissed that. I came home and called my nephew just to tell him how much I enjoyed his 2 yr. old daughter who I played with all day yesterday (and she loves Auntie K) I had 1 glass of wine when I did that and that made me cry even more and I don't know why. Why do I do this to myself. What the f### is wrong with me? Why did I cry? Why was I so UP. I should have used the energy for housework. Please send you comments. I guess I'm not getting better. You guys have been more help to me than anyone else, but I'm drinking now, so I don't want to answer too much. In case I do, well - it will be interesting if you can read it. Thanx 
 The Link Between Bipolar Disorder and Anger by Buck Black, LCSW Oct 19th 2009 Anger is always the symptom of a problem. A persons beliefs, use of alcohol and other drugs, or a combination of past emotional hurts may be at the root of anger. However, some people have anger that is based in imbalances in brain chemistry, instead of emotions or drugs introduced into the body. For those who have anger stemming from bipolar disorder, it can range from mild to wild. Often, there is no particular trigger that sets off anger. Rather, the person may simply wake up feeling angry. In other instances, the person may be sensitive to particular actions that invoke anger for the majority of people. There are some cases where a person will significantly over-react in a very angry manner to an event that the majority of people will only find as an irritation or inconvenience. A person with bipolar disorder has a condition that is linked to chemical imbalances in the brain. The symptoms are comprised of going through cycles of depression and mania (too much energy, poor decision making, and/or racing thoughts). A significant portion of people with bipolar disorder also have moderate to high levels of anger. It is accepted that most people with bipolar disorder need medication to help correct chemical imbalances in the brain. Therapy is often very helpful because thoughts, environment, and social/family support are all very important factors in controlling bipolar symptoms. Making an appointment with a psychiatrist, nurse practitioner, or primary care physician who has training in mental health is another avenue to pursue. In most cases, a person with bipolar disorder will have the most success when participating in therapy and taking medication. There are various types of therapy and medications that have been shown to reduce bipolar disorder symptoms. Keep in mind that each person will respond to therapy and medications in different ways. A prescription that helps one person with bipolar disorder does not necessarily help the next. This also holds true for therapy. Anger management can be very beneficial for some. However, there is often the need for CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), which has a focus on changing negative or angry thoughts to positive thoughts, as well as changing behaviors that promote anger. Therapy is also useful to help the client identify strengths and members of their support system. Focusing on these strengths and supports allows the client to have additional means of coping with anger and other symptoms of bipolar disorder. Remember that self-care needs to be a priority. This means keeping all of your therapy and doctor appointments, taking all medications as prescribed, and also being an active participant in therapy sessions. Outside of your doctors and therapists offices, it is important to make sure that you are getting out of the house and taking part in some kind of activity, whether it be interacting with family, going to social events, exercising, or participating in a hobby you enjoy. There are great community resources in most areas, such as free support groups at Mental Health America. Buck Black offers psychotherapy for anger issues through his practice in the Lafayette Indiana area (Lafayette Indiana Therapist | Buck Black, MSW, LCSW | 765-807-6778) via phone, email, and office visits. He also provides anger and stress management for truckers via phone, webcam, and email at www.TruckerTherapy.com. 
 I'm starting to wonder if I'm bi polar or not. Right now I'm on an anti depressant, but it seems to me that my moods are still really up and down. Sometimes I'll go a week of being on cloud 9 and I'll be really productive and over achieve, and other weeks I still work hard and get all my house responsibilities done, but I feel like I have to motivate myself so much more to do it. I find often that I'll start my day being really happy, and the smallest thing can set me off and I'll end up being SO over emotional, sometimes angry. Other days I wake up totally irritable and then suddenly I change within a few hours and then crash again a few hours later. Some weeks I feel fine and healthy and other weeks I feel run down and have almost constant headaches and pains. I would say that more often than not I'm depressed, even though I'm on a strong anti depressant. I also take dex which is probably why I can fit so much into a single day. The down side of the dex is it lasts too long in my body and I end up not being able to sleep until 3 or 4am, sometimes I end up pulling an all nighter, and I find I won't even feel tired for another 2 -3 days at which point I just crash... very frustrating.... Any suggestions?!?! 
 I have spent 30 minutes, last week, with a psychiatrist who says I sound like I have a personality disorder (NOS = not a specific determined type), but not Biploar II. he says this is based on listening to my personal history (he said he would have his team evaluate me further and have me join therapy, group and individual, for my personality disorder). he said that he doesn't think I have Bipolar II based on my story, but also because when people are in hypomania, they need less sleep (I always need lots of sleep). Is is always the case? 
 So I have two questions. The psychiatrist at the hospital said I am most likely bipolar, my outpatient psychiatrist says that I am not, and that I just have depression. What I experience, however, does follow along the lines of bipolar, as typically I swing every 48 hours, almost like clockwork, and the mania side of things is rather pleasant, but I tend to push myself to do to much and become overwhelmed, become irritable, overconfident, and tend to talk a mile a minute. The depressive stage I become extremely sleepy, have pessimistic views, irritability, tend to isolate.... you know, you just want to crawl back under the covers and just 'not exist in this world' for the day. I often try to incite a 'manic' state as it helps me get things done, by drinking lots and lots of caffine, but that never works, heart pumps fast, that's about it, still feel like napping lol. Now the second questions is, is it bad for someone with bipolar disorder to take only antidepressants? I say this because my episodes of mania are more so hypomania, and I've never acted on compulsive feelings during this state (as I am still self-aware), thus I figure, keep the mania, lose the depression. Not totally informed on how bipolar works so just wondering. 
 AN ACCOUNT OF MY BIPOLAR DISORDER A 65 YEAR CONTEXT: October 1943 To December 2008 BY RON PRICE George Town Tasmania Australia (71 Pages: Font 1427,000 words) 1. Preamble and Introduction: 1.1 This is a longitudinal, retrospective account going back to my conception in October 1943. I make reference to a genetic predisposition to bipolar disorder(BPD) due to a family history of affective disorder in a first-degree relative, my mother(1904-1978). She had BPD, although her disability was never given that medical diagnosis. About half of all patients with BPD have one parent who also has a mood disorder. There is, therefore, a clinical significance in my mothers mood disorder in the diagnosis of my own BPD. The high heritability of BPD has been well documented through familial incidence, twin, and adoption studies. There is an unquestionable justification for the inclusion of my family in my understanding of BPD. No specific gene has yet been identified as the one "bipolar gene." It appears likely that BPD is caused by the presence of multiple genes conferring susceptibility to BPD when combined with psychosocial stressors. I make this point as an opening remark and pass on to my story. ----------I WILL POST INSTALMENT #2 IF THIS ONE ENGAGES SOME READERS HERE--------------- 
 Children of Bipolar Patients by Dr Charles Raison September 17, 2009 Many bipolar patients must face the terrifying prospect that their illness may be passed along to their children! A recent Q&A post from CNN Health.net caught our attention: Question: "My boyfriend and I discussing getting engaged and having children one day. He said he's scared to have kids. His biological grandmother and his father both have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He has no symptoms of it, but some of his siblings do. He is terrified that his children could inherit this disorder! My family has no history of it at all. Since neither of us have it, should we be worried?"Expert (Dr Charles Raison) answers: The answer -- as best as we know from many studies over the years -- is that you should be worried but not terrified. Although we have very little definitive knowledge about which genes cause bipolar disorder (i.e., manic depression) or how they might do it, there is no doubt that the disease runs in families. Moreover, a person's risk of coming down with bipolar disorder is directly proportional to how many relatives have it and how close they are genetically to the individual. Consider the situation with twins. If you are an identical twin and your twin has bipolar disorder you have a 50 percent chance of having or getting it yourself. If you are a non-identical twin the risk falls to around 10 percent in most studies. If both your parents have bipolar disorder you have a 50 percent chance of getting it say some studies. If only one parent has it, your odds fall to around 10 percent. What I find really amazing is that if you have a parent or a sibling with bipolar disorder you are about twice as likely to have regular old depression as you are to come down with bipolar disorder. This last piece of data points to something important. The genes that set a person up for getting bipolar disorder are only somewhat specific for bipolar disorder per se. What really runs in families is a tendency toward mood disorders in general, as well as a number of other conditions, such as anxiety and risk of substance abuse. But there is a piece of good news. A number of studies suggest that family members without the full disease tend to be more creative and/or intelligent than average, run-of-the-mill folks, which may be part of the reason why the genes for bipolar disorder are still with us. Some of the greatest poets of the past 200 years have had bipolar disorder, as have many artists, scientists and political leaders. If you are interested in this check out a great book called Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament by Kay Redfield Jamison, Ph.D. So what is the take-home message for your situation? The fact that neither you nor your potential fiancé have bipolar disorder does indeed offer promise that your children would be at less risk for developing the condition. It is also good that you have no affected individuals in your family. In terms of your husband, his age is also very relevant to what his risk might be of developing the disease. Most people first show definitive symptoms in their 20s and often have a history of mood swings, irritability and depression dating back to childhood. If your boyfriend is a little older and/or has been steady as a rock thus far, his risks of developing the illness (and therefore having a stronger genetic loading that might get passed down to children) is pretty low. If your boyfriend is a good man and you love him, I wouldn't let what you've described to me stand in the way of marrying or having children. But I would keep half an eye on any future children and intervene early if they show signs of psychiatric abnormality. 
 Well I went today to see the psychiatrist...it didn't take very long at all. He just asked me some questions...not all that many and that was it. He asked me if I had endless energy sometimes and I said yeah and he asked me if I ever felt "high" I when I had all that energy. I was like yes and I feel like I have electricity running through me. He said "you seem very sped up to me right now" I told him I was also depressed and he said "but would you say you're more sped up right now?" I said yeah. He said I have classic bipolar disorder...and said I was manic. He said something like if your so high you feel all charged up like that, that's not normal. He asked me if I felt like my thoughts were racing and I said yeah, I try to read something and I can't even get through the first sentence because...and he said before I finished "the words just don't register?" Then he said he could tell my thoughts were racing because of the way I talk! He really knows what he is doing, what can I say. So I'm going to try Lithium first and see if that works because there's a program here where certain meds are $4/month if you're uninsured. The first one he recommended wasn't included in that and is pretty expensive. I'm very in dept right now so, that's jut seems more logical. I never thought of feeling "high" as something abnormal unless I also feel sad (paradox). I always thought of most of my problems as separate things...not one big thing like that! But then, I'm really just glad I know because it explains A LOT! It less overwhelming to look at all of this as one problem rather than a bunch of problems. CL 
 Hi, I was wondering if anyone could give me a good amount of scenarios and examples of how someone who has bipolar disorder typically acts. *I guess it would depend on the level of bipolar the person is suffering from though. *I've always wondered if my mother is seriously ill, but nothing was ever done to find out when I was still living at home and it was a huge struggle to live with her, I was psychologically and emotionally abused by her throughout childhood. *If my dad had tried to take her to see a psychiatrist she would have completely lost out, but she did that every day anyway. *I know there's something wrong and I am determined to get to the bottom of it. *Because whatever it is, it didn't start with her - I found a letter from my uncle to her explaining how he believes their family was screwed up while they were children - and my mother supposedly disagreed, but she's very messed up now. *The closest disorder that resembles her symptoms, from my surfing the web and looking at mental disorders, is bipolar. *Does anyone here have a family member, particularly one of their parents who suffered from this illnes while they were growing up? *Or is someone living under the roof of a parent struggling with this now? *I have got to find out what the problem is, because I'm so afraid of this cycle continuing in my family and I want to put an end to it. *I don't want anyone else to suffer the way I did. * If you know anything about the typical symptoms in those suffering from bipolar disorder, please let me know, thanks. 
 I suppose this is a question for the non-bipolar people. I'm tracking my moods daily and on the program I use there is an option for "mixed moods". I guess I always thought that mixed moods were perfectly normal. Do non-bipolar people not "suffer" from mixed moods, or mood fluctuations during the day?

 8 Myths About Bipolar Disorder By Kathleen Doheny, WebMD Bipolar disorder is on the rise, yet myths persist. Experts separate the facts from the fiction. Because of increased awareness and diagnosis, more people than ever before have a basic understanding of bipolar disorder, the condition formally known as manic depression. Yet myths persist about this mental disorder that causes mood shifts from depression to mania and affects a person's energy and ability to function. WebMD asked five bipolar disorder experts to help unravel what's myth and what's fact. Read on for the eight common myths about bipolar they often hear from patients and the public. Bipolar Myth No. 1: Bipolar disorder is a rare condition. Not so, according to statistics and research. In a given year, bipolar disorder affects about 5.7 million American adults, or about 2.6% of the U.S. population 18 and older, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Estimates for children and teens vary widely, partly because there is debate about the criteria for diagnosis, say Thomas E. Smith, MD, a research scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. But the Child and Adolescent Bipolar Foundation estimates that at least three quarters of a million American children and teens may suffer from bipolar disorder, although many are not diagnosed. A recent study by researchers from Columbia University and elsewhere showed the diagnosis of bipolar disorder is up dramatically in children and teens and is also on the rise in adults. When the researchers looked at the number of office visits with a bipolar disorder diagnosis in 1994-1995 and 2002-2003 in the U.S., they found that the number of office-based visits increased 40-fold for children and nearly doubled for adults from the first time period to the second. Bipolar Myth No. 2: Bipolar disorder is just another name for mood swings. Not so. The mood swings associated with bipolar disorder are very different than those of people without the condition, says Matthew Rudorfer, MD, associate director of treatment research in the division of services and intervention research at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md. "The mood swings of bipolar [disorder] are more severe, longer lasting, and maybe most significant of all, they interfere with some important aspect of functioning, such as ability to work at one's job, or manage one's home, or be a successful student," he says. The mood swings of a person with bipolar disorder, experts agree, are far more severe than, say, a person without bipolar disorder being bummed out because rain spoiled the weekend plans or weight loss efforts aren't showing the desired results. Bipolar Myth No. 3: People with bipolar disorder shift back and forth from depression to mania very often. The Jekyll-Hyde personality, the type that can turn on a dime from sad to euphoric, is a myth about bipolar, says Gary Sachs, MD, director of the Bipolar Clinic and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. ''The average bipolar patient will be depressed more often [than manic]," he says. There are people with bipolar who will shift back and forth more quickly than others, Sachs says. But that's not the typical pattern, he says. "For the most part what is typical is to have an abnormal mood state colored by a predominance of high or low.'' What's an abnormal mood state? Something intense or unexpected in relation to a situation, such as giggling instead of crying when you find out your home will be foreclosed, Sachs says. Bipolar Myth No. 4: When they're in the manic phase, people with bipolar disorder are often very happy. True for some, experts tell WebMD, but not for others. And a person with bipolar disorder may enter the manic phase happy but not stay that way. "The hallmark of mania is a euphoric or elevated mood," Smith says. But, he says, "a significant number of people become edgy and irritable as the mania progresses." "Many people are actually frightened when they go into mania," says Sue Bergeson, CEO of the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance in Chicago, a patient-run mental health organization. "When you are moving into mania, you are losing control of your actions and thoughts," she says. Patients often complain they can't sleep, too. A person in a manic phase may go on spending sprees, use poor judgment, abuse drugs or alcohol, and have difficulty concentrating. Sexual drive can be increased and behavior can be "off" or out of character for what is normal for them. It's crucial, Smith says, to treat a manic phase (typically with mood-stabilizing drugs). If untreated, it can progress from an elevated mood to euphoria to extreme disorganization and other common signs of mania -- lack of sleep, increased energy, and disorganized behavior that interferes with relationships, he says. "I don't think people look forward to manic episodes," Smith says. "When you are not manic, you can look back and see how disruptive your life became." Smith advises bipolar disorder patients to know their early signs of a manic or depressive episode so they can get additional treatment promptly. Bipolar Myth No. 5: There is a bipolar test. Not true. In early 2008, an at-home bipolar test, sold over the Internet, made headlines. But the test only tells users whether their genetic makeup puts them at higher risk of having or getting bipolar disorder. The bipolar test evaluates saliva samples for two mutations in a gene called GRK3, associated with the disorder. But it can't tell users for sure. Today, a diagnosis of bipolar disorder depends on a doctor taking a careful patient history, asking about symptoms over time. A family history of the disorder increases a person's chances of getting it. Bipolar Myth No. 6: Bipolar disorder can't be diagnosed until age 18. Not true, says Sachs. But it is true that it's more difficult to diagnose it in some people than in others, because of varying patterns of the disorder. And typical childhood behavior -- such as having a tantrum and recovering quickly to go to a birthday party -- can also make it difficult to diagnose the condition in children. "There are clearly cases of children who have classic presentation in the early childhood years," he says. But if a child does not have a classic pattern, it's usually more difficult to make the diagnosis. Even so, the disorder may be present but not diagnosed until later, he says. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the median age of onset for bipolar disorder is 25 years old (half are older, half are younger). But Sachs says many adult patients report having symptoms before age 18, whether they were officially diagnosed or not. Bipolar Myth No. 7: People with bipolar disorder should not take antidepressants. Not true, says Smith, who explains where the myth originated. "There's a concern, and it's valid, that some people who are depressed and bipolar, if they take antidepressants ... could flip into a mania." The thinking, however skewed, is that the mood will be elevated too much and mania will result. Although the concern has some validity, Smith says, "that does not mean you should always avoid antidepressants." Sometimes, he says, people need the drugs, especially if the depression persists. In a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, Sachs and his colleagues randomly assigned 366 patients with bipolar disorder to a treatment of mood stabilizer drugs and placebo or to mood stabilizer drugs and an antidepressant, following them for up to 26 weeks. They found no differences in adverse effects, including a shift from depression to mania, between the two groups. Bipolar Myth No. 8: Aside from taking medication and engaging in psychotherapy or "talk therapy," a person with bipolar disorder has few options for controlling the condition. Not true. "Medication and therapy are important," says Ken Duckworth, MD, medical director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. But paying attention to lifestyle can help, too, he says. "Active" strategies, such as getting regular aerobic exercise, keeping a regular bedtime, eating a healthful diet, and paying attention to personal warning signs that a shift to depression or mania is coming can all help a person manage bipolar disorder, he tells WebMD. "If people know their warning signs, they can stave off disaster," Duckworth says. For instance: If a person with bipolar knows he starts to wake up at 4 a.m. when he is shifting to mania, he can pay attention to that pattern, Duckworth says, and promptly seek medical help.

 Having read some of the information on this.. I believe this is where I am at at the moment and also for the past week or more. I want to apologise for not posting much on other threads, I am finding it difficult to write, I cannot seem to connect my thoughts to my feelings, even writing this I am thinking "why". For the most part I feel totally flat, this "flatness" is getting to me in a big way now and that makes me think that this period\phase is changing to one of being depressed. I am a bit low and cannot seem to shake it off. I guess the point of this is to let you all know that I am reading and I do support each of ye just not able to express that support properly at this time. 
 How a Bipolar Patient Learned to Manage Mania by Laurel Lemke, as told to by Tania Haas April 22, 2008 Like many people with bipolar disorder, Laurel Lemke, 54, of Lakewood, Wash., cycled in and out of hospitals and tried various treatments before being diagnosed and treated with her disorder. Though she will likely never be "cured," her mental illness no longer is central to her life. Here is how she copes today If someone had told me when I was in my teens that one day I'd be a spokesperson for a mental health group, I wouldn't have believed them. Chances are, I wouldn't have understood them either. When I was 18, I was drowsy on antipsychotics and hospitalized for my first manic attack. But a lot has changed since then, and over the last 36 years I've learned how to manage my health. And, as a member of NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), I help other people understand mental illness for themselves and their loved ones. Mental illness made college hell Today I talk openly about my bipolar disorder, but for a long time I didn't tell anyone about it. First of all, I didn't really understand the illness, let alone want to share this big secret with people. Though, at times, it was hard to conceal. Whenever I was stressed or overtired or feeling enormous pressure, I was at risk of going through another manic episode. That's what happened when I started college at a reputable liberal arts women's school—which will remain nameless. The unfamiliar surroundings, the irregular class schedule, and the unlimited opportunity offered me too many choices. And it resulted in unmanageable stress. I couldn't sleep, I would forget to eat, and I would talk incredibly fast. I even thought I had ESP—when a song would come on the radio, I thought, "Hey, I predicted that song." I sensed something was wrong, but I didn't know what it was. So I visited the college's infirmary. During the first few visits, the college doctor focused on my insomnia. He gave me medication to sleep and sent me home. But when the sleep medication didn't work, and I was getting more hyper and my energy was peaking beyond control, the doctor sent me to a hospital. To my surprise, they had me stay in the hospital for six weeks. Imagine: I had just started college, a bright-eyed, ambitious student and then, three weeks later, I was a patient in a mental ward of a hospital. It was hard to understand, even harder to accept. Doctors couldn't agree on a diagnosis Back then there was very little medical consensus on bipolar disorder—and there was very little patient consultation on which treatment would be preferred. The medication I was given snowed me. I couldn't function. I was sleeping during the day, wide awake at night. It was horrible. My family was extremely supportive, but it was a very confusing time. My condition was not officially called bipolar at this time because I hadn't had enough episodes for a clear diagnosis. At the end of the six-week period, my energy levels stabilized, and I felt like myself. When I was ready for school, the college wouldn't accept me—something about me not being an ideal student. I went to a different college while my father appealed for my reentry. The following year I returned to my original college of choice, and I eventually graduated. Stigma about mental illness was very common then, and it remains a challenge now. I think the best way to combat this stigma is to talk about it, its symptoms, the genetic component, and also how lifestyle choices can influence your susceptibility to more manias. What triggers her manic episodes My next manic episode happened when I was 25. I have since had seven or eight episodes, and they usually happen when I undergo a major change: my mother's death, a new job, or a longer commute to work. Although I find it hard to remember my behavior during my manic stages, I know I have a bundle of symptoms: I tend to lose my sense of humor, I find it hard to follow directions, I can be unreasonably suspicious, and I cry easily. I am happy to say that my episodes have grown less frequent as I've aged and become more aware of my personal triggers. Bipolar can be different for different people and come on differently at different times in their lives. Today, I manage my bipolar condition by keeping a regular schedule. Routines. Without them, I'd be far less healthy. I try to exercise regularly, I don't drink alcohol anymore, and I eat "happy" foods like raw fruits and vegetables. But even with the most discipline, there's always a chance that I could slip back into a manic state. Sometimes my mental illness is in the foreground, sometimes it's in the background. Bipolar disorder ran in her family, but she didn't know it The genetic component of bipolar is something that I cannot control. And like many families, I didn't even know that mental illness was in my family until much later in life. A few years ago, a genealogist contacted me while he was researching my family for another individual. He told me that my great-grandmother had killed herself and that she likely suffered from some mental illness. This came as a complete shock to me, and I'm certain that my father (he passed away years ago) didn't know about this either. Knowing this information about a relative—although tragic—somehow helped me understand and accept my condition a little more. It also reminded me of the importance of managing my condition. My family didn't talk about my great-grandmother's illness, but they were the only ones who knew about my mental illness for a long time. The privacy was comforting, but it also limited my social support network. That changed when I was in my 30s. I started to branch out socially. I discovered that I loved ballroom dancing, and it became my favorite hobby. I traveled with a dancing tour group and we went as far as Australia. In addition to learning new steps, I made lasting friendships. And my closest friends know about my bipolar diagnosis. When I told them, more often than not, they would always respond by telling me they knew someone else in their family or network of friends who also had bipolar. 9 Ways to Control Bipolar Disorder Various strategies to keep bipolar disorder under control: Exercise daily. Moderate physical activity for 30 minutes a day can help control mood swings.Eat a balanced diet. Make sure you are getting all the nutrients you need. Eating meals at regular times will help establish a stress-reducing daily routine.Avoid traveling into other time zones. If you are planning to travel extensively, you may want to call your doctor before you leave. Traveling into other time zones can disrupt your medication schedule and trigger a manic episode.Take your meds. In all, 1 in 3 people will remain completely free of symptoms of bipolar disorder by taking mood-stabilizing medicine, such as carbamazepine or lithium, for life.Get the same number of hours of sleep every night. Changes in your sleep patterns can sometimes trigger a manic or depressive episode. Try your best to keep the same bedtime and rise time, varying them by no more than an hour.Avoid alcohol and illegal drugs. Even one drink can disrupt your sleep, change your mood, or interfere with your medicines, which can make symptoms worse or even trigger an episode.Reduce stress at work and at home. Try to keep regular hours at work so stress won’t trigger a manic or depressive episode. If stress at work or at home is a problem, counseling may help. It is important to schedule some recreation in your day, even if it is just for a short period. This should generally include social time.Limit caffeine and nicotine during manic episodes. Caffeine and nicotine can both act as stimulants, which can make symptoms worse. Plus, too much caffeine can change your sleeping habits.seek treatment as soon as you notice symptoms of a depressive or manic episode coming on. Getting treatment immediately will help you to proactively manage your symptoms and avoid disruptions to your life. Often you don't notice early signs or symptoms, so take the time to educate whoever is closest to you what signs and symptoms to look for. They can alert you when they see a change that suggests the beginning of a mood episode. Show them you welcome such feedback, and be sure to take it seriously if you get it. 
 Just a curious question. When someone with Bipolar is in a manic state, can they be more pre disposed to panic attacks or psychosis episodes? Do people with Bipolar often have panic attacks too or psychosis? This is just curiousity, cause I do not know a lot about Bipolar. Thanks 
 This article gives some very good tips on how to explain bipolar disorder to your friends or loved ones. How To Explain Bipolar Disorder to Others - Explaining Bipolar Disorder 
 Bipolar Mania: A Vicious Cycle By Joe Kraynak August 5, 2009 Bipolar mania can really foul up the family dynamic. One minute, your family is cruising along on autopilot, and the next minute you’re in a tailspin. It can begin innocently enough with a barely perceptible increase in irritability and criticism, and then quickly escalate into knock-down, drag-out conflicts, all of which contribute to worsening the mania. Recently, when I began feeling the ground shift under my family, I sketched out the cycle as I see it. Mania: Various factors can contribute to triggering a manic episode, and they can generally be broken down into two categories: biological and environmental. People with bipolar typically have a genetic vulnerability to bipolar, but then environmental factors, including stressors, trigger the expression of it – the mania or depression.Fear, Frustration, Anxiety: Loved ones, suspecting that another episode of mania is in the works, can begin to feel fear and anxiety over what’s happening and frustration over not being able to do anything to stop it. This is especially true if their attempts to help are rejected.Anger: Fear, anxiety, and frustration can express themselves as fear, anxiety, and frustration, but they can and do frequently find expression in anger.Conflict: Anger almost always leads to conflict, which feeds the mania the additional stress it needs to thrive. Mania is like an energy-eating monster. Blast it with TNT and even nuclear weapons, and the monster gobbles it up and grows bigger and stronger. As the vicious cycle continues, it intensifies. The mania becomes more severe; fear, anxiety, and frustration increase; anger intensifies; and conflict escalates. Something has to break the cycle, and it’s best to break it at each and every stage in the cycle: Treating the mania: Medication and various forms of therapy can help quell the mania.Dealing with fear, frustration, and anxiety: Loved ones could benefit by seeking counseling themselves to determine ways of managing their emotional responses to very stressful conditions. Learning about bipolar is a great start, but it’s not enough when you’re actually involved in confrontations.Alleviating the anger: Fear, anxiety, and frustration can express themselves as fear, anxiety, and frustration, but they can and do frequently find expression in anger. Again, loved ones could benefit by practicing techniques for dealing with emotions more effectively and productively.Disengaging from conflict: Anger almost always leads to conflict, which feeds the mania the additional stress it needs to thrive. Mania is like an energy-eating monster. Blast it with TNT and even nuclear weapons, and it only gets bigger and stronger. When you feel attacked, instincts tell you to fight back. Disengaging, however, is often the better choice. Whenever I find myself involved in the nasty family dynamics that often result from (and contribute to) mania, my first reaction is typically the “woe is me” response. I hate mania. I hate what it does to my loved one who’s experiencing it, what it does to me, and what it does to my family. Every single time, I have to remind myself that regardless how I feel, engaging in conflicts with loved ones doesn’t make anything better and often makes it worse. Unfortunately, when you’re trying to convince someone to get help who doesn’t think they need it, confrontation isn’t always avoidable. About Joe Kraynak: In 1999, my wife, Cecie, experienced her first major manic episode. She ended up in St. Vincent’s Stress Center, where she was diagnosed as having bipolar disorder. She has been hospitalized a total of three times – all for mania. She rarely experiences the debilitating depression that many people with bipolar disorder struggle with. We have two children together, both of whom are pretty much adults at this point. Over the past decade or so, we’ve struggled to coexist with this disease. At times, it seems to be a cruel puppet master pulling our strings to act out some demented drama on the stage we call our home. Most times, we manage to keep this beast chained up, through a combination of medicine and therapy, but occasionally it escapes and turns our home inside out. In 2005, I had the good fortune to co-author Bipolar Disorder For Dummies with Dr. Candida Fink. In the process, I learned a great deal about bipolar disorder and strategies for treating it, preventing major mood episodes, and dealing with the fallout when preventive measures are ineffective. Through this blog, I hope to share what I’ve learned about bipolar while I continue to discover even more. 
 Bipolar disorder often misdiagnosed, study reveals by Paul Bright, The Examiner July 3, 2009 A recent study released by the Journal of Psychiatry seems to suggest that bipolar disorder is being misdiagnosed at a regular rate. According to one study of 82 patients, many had been diagnosed without the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Once the SCID was actually applied, the results were compared to over 500 patients who had not been previously diagnosed. Most of the 82 patients actually had borderline personality disorder and not bipolar disorder. In an earlier study, 700 patients were interviewed. 150 said they had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but without the SCID. Once the SCID was applied to them, less than half qualified for a bipolar disorder diagnosis. Mark Zimmerman, the Psychiatrist who led the first study, believes that the misdiagnosis may have to do with a psychiatrist's preferred method of treatment. ""We hypothesize that in patients with mood instability, physicians are inclined to diagnose a potentially medication-responsive disorder such as bipolar disorder rather than a disorder such as borderline personality disorder that is less medication-responsive. 
 Classic, Intense Symptoms Not Always Present in People With Bipolar Disorder by6 Mark Frye, M.D., Psychiatry, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn. Medical Edge from Mayo Clinic July 24, 2009 DEAR MAYO CLINIC: Two years ago, I went through an extremely traumatic situation. Since then, I have had mood swings, but no severe lows. I'm taking medications for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, but they haven't helped. Could what I'm experiencing be bipolar disorder? Is there a definitive way for doctors to diagnose bipolar disorder? If that is what I have, is medication my only treatment option?ANSWER: Yes, it is possible that you have bipolar disorder. Your mood swings after a traumatic event and lack of response to medications are clues that your diagnosis may be incorrect. The classic symptoms of bipolar disorder, also called manic-depressive illness, are alternating emotional highs (mania) and lows (depression). In mania, people may feel overly happy, agitated, jumpy or irritable. They may need less sleep than normal, or make unusually risky decisions about money, work and relationships. Depression in bipolar disorder appears with typical depression symptoms, such as a loss of interest in normal activities, sadness, feelings of emptiness, difficulty concentrating and thoughts of suicide. Increasingly, research suggests that people with bipolar disorder don't always have the classic and intense symptoms. Symptoms can vary from severe to mild. Cyclothymia, the term for a mild form of bipolar disorder, includes mood swings, but the ups and downs are not as severe as those of full-blown bipolar disorder. Some patients have mixed state bipolar, where symptoms of mania and depression occur at the same time. For anyone with bipolar disorder, mood swings can occur every few days, every few weeks, or every few months. We now know that, early in the disease, bipolar mood swings can be linked to a major stress. Those stresses can be negative, like a death in the family or job loss, or positive, perhaps marriage or a promotion. Symptoms can include those you've described -- mild mood swings without severe depression. Because it's not a straightforward illness, bipolar disorder is often misdiagnosed. The most important diagnostic tool is an in-depth interview with a care provider to discuss health history and possible signs and symptoms of the illness. The clinician should cover family history, too. Bipolar disorder has a genetic component and often runs in families. Considerable research is under way on other diagnostic tools. But, so far, bipolar disease can't be diagnosed with a brain scan, a blood test or paper-and-pencil tests. That said, you might find it helpful to review a mood disorder screening questionnaire, available at Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance. While the questionnaire is not a diagnostic tool, your answers may help your provider determine a diagnosis. Medications are a critical part of bipolar disorder treatment. Several categories of medications are used, including mood stabilizers, anti-seizure medications, anti-psychotic medications, and at times, antidepressants. Sometimes, the first medication prescribed for a patient might not work. Several trials of different medications are not unusual prior to arriving at an appropriate drug treatment regimen. Outside support and psychotherapy, which could be individual, group or family therapy, are important elements of treatment and disease management. I recommend that you see a psychiatrist or other care provider to discuss your symptoms and to revisit your diagnosis and treatment plan. If you have depression and PTSD, perhaps different medications or doses would help. Everyone responds to medications differently. By the way, you can have both bipolar disorder and PTSD. If the correct diagnosis is bipolar disorder, it's important to seek appropriate treatment. Without treatment, the disease can progress, with more intense phases of mania and depression that can, at a minimum, interfere with daily activities, work and interpersonal relationships. -- Medical Edge from Mayo Clinic is an educational resource and doesn't replace regular medical care.

 Bipolar Disorder, Treating the Whole Person Allan Schwartz, LCSW, Ph.D. Jul 17th 2009 The impact of Bipolar Disorder can be so severe that it impacts people along four main dimensions of life: Body, Mind, Emotions and Social Life. Consequently, it impairs the a person's ability to work and maintain intimate relationships. People with this disorder experience a high rate of divorce. There is also a very high correlation between having the disorder and using alcohol and other drugs of abuse. At its worst, someone with Bipolar Disorder experiences hallucinations, delusions and suicidal ideation with the intent to end their lives. It is for these reasons that treatment of the whole person is the key to regulating the disorder and preventing relapse. In other words, treating symptoms with meditation is an important first step in the recover process. Then, psychotherapy in conjunction with medication becomes all important. Psycho education is also necessary to help the patient recognize triggers to relapse. Armed with medication, information and psychotherapy, patients learn how to avoid a relapse. Avoiding relapse includes remaining compliant with medications while staying away from drugs and alcohol. Stress, overwork and too little sleep are among the types of factors that trigger Bipolar symptoms. Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder Manic Symptoms: IrritabilitySleeping less without tiring.Experiencing a rush of energy.Uncontrolled spending.Feeling more self-confident than usual.Socializing/partying out of character.Talking fast and more than usual.Disjointed racing thoughts and ideas.Difficulty concentrating.Increased desire for sex.Uncharacteristic reckless behavior. Much of this happens because the individual is in a delusional state. Depression Symptoms: Prolonged sadness and crying.Significant change in appetite with eating more or less.Sleeping more than usual.Loss of pleasure in usual interests.Social withdrawal and isolation.Feelings of worthlessness.Suicidal thoughts.Irritability, anger, anxiety.Negativity and indifference.Loss of energy and increased tiredness. Here, too, delusions and hallucinations are possible. There can be variability of symptoms with some people rapid cycling between manic and depressive symptoms while others remain stuck at the depressive pole, and every other variation in between rapid cycling and unipolar depression. The depression pole of this disorder occurs 4 times more often than the mania. It is possible to have one episode of mania and, later, episodes of depression alone. It is estimated that some four percent of the population has Bipolar disorder. There are those who point out that diagnosis is so difficult and frequently incorrect that the percentages can range up to ten percent of the population. Diagnosis is very difficult with Bipolar disorder because it overlaps other conditions. For example, dysthymia or mild depression is often diagnosed instead of Bipolar disorder. Also, Bipolar often resembles Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It is estimated that it can take ten years before some people are correctly diagnosed and treated for this illness. In returning to the main theme of this article, it is quite important that the whole person be treated. There was a time when mental health experts believed that Bipolar patients could not benefit from psychotherapy. It is now known that this is not true. In actuality, psychotherapy is important, along with medication, to treat and control the awful symptoms that afflict people with Bipolar. There is a real human being, under the symptoms, who struggles with all the usual daily stresses of life. Among these are marriage, children, employment, finances and all the other pressures of life. Either psychodynamic or cognitive behavioral psychotherapy are very helpful for patients. The advantages of CBT are that it helps the patient learn to counter the types of thoughts that can lead to relapse. Many of these have to do with low self esteem, the wish to resume substance abuse and thoughts of hopelessness. In my experience it has been very interesting that some of the brightest and most creative people are afflicted with this disorder. However, counter to the romantic idea that being in a manic or depressive phase is what gives rise to creativity, it is only when a person's mood is stabilized that they have access to their full creativity and intellectual abilities. I recommend the autobiographical by Kay Redfield Jamison, An Unquiet Mind, for a graphic and accurate description of what it is like to cope with this mental disorder. 
 Can a person with bipolar have "normal" depression? I have been wondering if for instance, If I was in therapy and dealing with x issue and in so doing become depressed, how do I know if it is just the issue at hand that is making me feel this way or whether it is another mood episode? is there any distinction here? if so what is it and how does one know and what would be the bast way to handle it in that case. Maybe silly question\s but it won't go away. This is just one of the thoughts\question running through my mind of late, if anyone can help I would be glad to hear. 
 Gender influences age of bipolar onset 22 February 2005 Psychiatry Matters Researchers have found gender differences in the incidence and age at onset of mania and bipolar disorder, with men affected earlier than women. "Despite clear gender differences in the symptoms and course of bipolar affective disorder, studies investigating age at onset by gender have yielded inconsistent results," note Noel Kennedy, from the Institute of Psychiatry in London, UK, and colleagues. For their study, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, the team identified all cases of first-episode psychosis, mania, or hypomania in adults presenting to services in Camberwell, southeast London, between 1965 and 1999. This included 246 patients who met the criteria for DSM-IV bipolar I disorder, first manic episode, of whom 141 (57%) were female, while the remaining 105 (43%) were male. The average age at onset of mania was 32.9 years, with onset occurring earlier in men than in women, at an average age of 30 years versus 35 years. Indeed, almost half of the male patients experienced their first episode of mania by the age of 25 years, and 80% by the age of 35 years. In comparison, only one-third of the female patients had experienced mania by the age of 25 years, and just 64% by the age of 35 years. Similarly, the onset of bipolar disorder occurred in 56% of men by the age of 25 years and in 83% by the age of 35 years, compared with 37% and 68% of women, respectively. The researchers note that the incidence of first manic episode peaked in men for the 16 to 25-year age group, whereas for women the incidence was lower in this age group, it was higher throughout the rest of adult life in women than for men. Further analysis also revealed that childhood antisocial behavior was independently associated with earlier onset of mania and bipolar disorder. This led Kennedy et al to speculate that there may be a "subgroup of early-onset predominantly male bipolar disorder patients with behavioral difficulties." They explain: "Antisocial behavior in childhood could be a manifestation of neurodevelopmental abnormality or even of early-onset bipolar disorder." Am J Psychiatry 2005; 162: 257-262 
 I found this while searching for info on Dysphoric mania. Hope it is okay to post it here. Dysphoria - What is Dysphoria The dictionary definition of dysphoria is actually very straightforward - a state of feeling unwell or unhappy. However, that could describe anything from PMS to raging flu to crying because your goldfish died. Many medical dictionaries define dysphoria simply as anxiety. But these definitions just do not describe properly the way dysphoria applies to the moods associated with bipolar disorder cycles. Many use dysphoria to define types of manic episodes while others associate it with depressive episodes. The truth is, it is actually quite valid as a description for either mania OR depression. Dysphoric mania, as described in the Merck Manual, is "prominent depressive symptoms superimposed on manic psychosis." Symptoms include: cryingcurtailed sleepracing thoughtsgrandiositypsychomotor restlessnesssuicidal ideationpersecutory delusionsauditory hallucinationsindecisivenessconfusion In everyday English, the complex terms above for symptoms of mania with dysphoria include - trouble sleeping, racing thoughts, grandiosity, mental and/or physical agitation, thoughts of suicide, feeling persecuted for no reason, hearing things, and having trouble making decisions (along with others). Dysphoric depression, which many people think of as a mixed episode, consists of "intrusions of hypomanic symptoms or hyperthymic traits into a retarded major depressive episode" (Merck). Basically, this means that characteristics of hypomania or overactivity occur during a depression that in general has the patient sluggish or listless. Symptoms include: irritabilitypressured speech against a background of retardationextreme fatigueguilty ruminationsfree-floating anxietypanic attacksintractable insomniaincreased libidohistrionic appearance with expressions of depressive suffering Once again putting this into more common terms, the symptoms above for depression with dysphoria include: being easily angered, having pressured speech in spite of slowed thinking, being overtired, dwelling on guilt feelings, being anxious in general (for no specific reason), having serious difficulty in sleeping, having extra sex drive, and being melodramatic about feeling depressed. Important Note: When associated with either mania or depression, dysphoria is linked with a greatly increased risk for suicide and should always be brought to the attention of a medical professional By Kimberly Read & Marcia Purse, About.com 
 I had an eerie experience the other day when I was going back to edit some music I had written. Let me see if I can describe this without having to attach a link to a pdf file of the music. I'm trying to describe a visual effect that I created unnecessarily while getting excited over a certain section of the music. The music was building at certain spot, and in order to mark the exact tempo changes (metronome readings) for recording purposes, I had to input a number such as "66" (meaning 66 half notes per minute, in this case) or "72," (a little faster), "78" (faster still), and so forth. As I became excited, each time I had to put down the number for the metronome reading, I increased the font size in accordance with the acceleration of the piece. In other words, "66" might have been written in font size 12, then "72" in 14, etc. Finally, the very fastest, at the exact piece, was in boldface in 24 - you get it. When I went back and looked at it, I remembered doing this, but I couldn't remember why I did it. Of course, no one would ever want to publish anything that way. But what I don't recall is what prompted me to take the extra time and energy to do something that was so unnecessary. Did I think, at the time, that it was funny? It reminds me, in a disquieting way, of some of the things that happened when I was having the initial Manic Episode in 2004. I would say and do things that made no sense to others, although I thought they made sense - and looking back, I can't recall why I thought they made sense. 
 On every questionaire / screening survey I have taken at my Psychologist I scored high on all for likely having Bipolarity, Granted i have yet to see my Pdoc but I am thinking its fairly likely that at least at first I will be on something other then an antidepressant at least at the start of treatment. However I have a few questions knowing that everyone has some forum of Bipolarity on this forum could possibly answer. I get irritated very easily, generally when this happens I have slight paranoia and delusional thinking (cloudy thinking), I have never and most likely will not have a full blown manic episode, is all of this part of Bipolarity? or is it likely that I have something else going on here? or is it even possible that this is just plain old major depression? I am new, this is my first time posting so i hope I am following rules of the forum, my appointment with my psychiatrist is still about 3 weeks away, thanks for listening. JP 
 How does a person know the severity of an episode of depression when depressed? I see the terms low grade depression, minor episodes, major depression and the descriptions of them but yet I cannot decide how to determine "where on the depression scale" I am or could be at times. 
 Bipolar Disorder Q&A: Can someone have bipolar without depression? By Candida Fink MD June 12, 2009 Ari Asks I have a friend who has most symptoms of bipolar, but doesnt seem to have any obvious sign of depression. He has most other signs of bipolar. Hes had about four episodes of manic behavior in the last five months which had lasted three to four days. Could he be bipolar in your opinion  like rapid-cycling bipolar disorder without the obvious sign or suffering of depression? Dr. Fink Answers Without seeing your friend, I cannot offer a diagnosis, but I can answer the general question of whether a person can have bipolar disorder without depression. The answer is yes  a diagnosis of Bipolar I only requires at least one manic episode  the diagnosis does not require an episode of major depression. While Bipolar I most typically expresses itself with episodes of major depression and episodes of mania, only the mania is necessary to make the diagnosis. Alternatively, in making a diagnosis of Bipolar II disorder, a major depressive episode is necessary, and in Bipolar II the up periods can only be hypomania rather than full blown mania. Once there is full blown mania, the diagnosis changes to Bipolar I. That being said, episodic mania without episodic depression is unusual. Although manic episodes do point to the possibility of a Bipolar I diagnosis, other conditions must be ruled out first. For example, the mania cannot be drug-induced, attributed to another identifiable medical condition, or be attributed to a schizoaffective disorder. Your friend should see a qualified psychiatrist, preferably one who has experience diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. 
 Bipolar Mania  Different Perspectives By Candida Fink MD June 9, 2009 In Bipolar Disorder for Dummies, we talk a little about the differences in how bipolar mania is seen from the outside as opposed to how it is experienced from the inside. Inside, a person experiencing mania may feel I am amazing!Everything is wonderful!I can do anything and everything!I have all the answers! My ideas will revolutionize the world!Sleep is only for people who have nothing better to do!Everybody loves me! Outsiders may have a completely different perspective, saying or at least thinking Boy is he bombastic!What a jerk!You need to sleep you havent slept in three days!Do you need to criticize every single thing I say?!Im so tired of arguing with you.Stop spending so much money youll go bankrupt! With such opposing perspectives, is it any wonder why people who are experiencing bipolar mania dont get the help they need? From their perspective, they dont need help  maybe everyone else does, but they dont. Perhaps worse is the fact that those around them often see bipolar not as the illness it is but as a character flaw or behavioral disorder  something the person needs to just learn to control. 
 Spring Forward, Fall Back By Joe Kraynak, Bipolar Beat Blog May 26, 2009 I work at home. My wife (who has bipolar) works for the local school district. Several times during the year are difficult for us. It seems, for example, that when we spring forward for daylight savings time, we almost invariably spring into mania. We do okay over the summer. When she returns to work in the fall, sometimes we do okay, sometimes not. The Christmas break is also usually a bad time. In part, I blame this on seasonal shifts, changes in workload, and holiday stress, but I think some of it is also due to the fact that the household dynamics change. Accustomed to spending 8-10 hours a day working alone, when school lets out, I suddenly have someone around nearly 24/7. Whatever balance weve achieved as individuals or a couple is suddenly gone, and we have to work on establishing a new balance with a whole new set of rules. Do you and your partner have to deal with similar transitions? Do you feel they cause enough strain to fuel a mood episode? What do you do, if anything, to try to smooth the transition and reduce the stress? In 1999, my wife, Cecie, experienced her first major manic episode. She ended up in St. Vincents Stress Center, where she was diagnosed as having bipolar disorder. She has been hospitalized a total of three times  all for mania. She rarely experiences the debilitating depression that many people with bipolar disorder struggle with. We have two children together, both of whom are pretty much adults at this point. Over the past decade or so, weve struggled to coexist with this disease. At times, it seems to be a cruel puppet master pulling our strings to act out some demented drama on the stage we call our home. Most times, we manage to keep this beast chained up, through a combination of medicine and therapy, but occasionally it escapes and turns our home inside out. In 2005, I had the good fortune to co-author Bipolar Disorder For Dummies with Dr. Candida Fink. In the process, I learned a great deal about bipolar disorder and strategies for treating it, preventing major mood episodes, and dealing with the fallout when preventive measures are ineffective. Through this blog, I hope to share what Ive learned about bipolar while I continue to discover even more. 
 That is what my psychiatrist says ? He is not sure about his diagnosis just yet having seen me only three times. I wanted to ask people on this news group if they can give me their opinions because the medication that I receive will depend on the diagnosis. I am working with my family physician also but he is not sure himself. I understand that most of us are not doctors and cannot give medical advice but if someone can share their experiences maybe it will give me a better idea as to whats wrong with me. So here is my story I find my self easily get down on my moods and my mood stays down sometimes for several days at a time. People coughing in my direction easily puts me down. I have been told that my depression is bipolar and irritable depression. Rarely I have a good day mostly and easily the bad days are more frequent. I have tried many anti depressants in the past but none of them have any long term good effects meaning. Mood stabilizers are a different type of med which I have never taken. I am now taking 600 mg of Seroquel an antipsychotic med and at that high level becomes a mood stabilizer but I have yet to feel the effects of it. I have also been told that I am a paranoid or delusional also hence the Seroquel. Can anyone share if they also been diagnosed with a Bipolar Depression or with a Mood Disorder ? I believe that its more over Bipolar/Mood Disorder then anything else. 
 Breaking Down Bipolar Anger by John McManamy Thursday, April 30, 2009 I've commented extensively on anger. My website provides a broad overview article, and an oldie but goodie on the same site, Bipolar or Bichronic, deals with the frustrations of operating in different states of time than the rest of the world. Last year I did a YouTube video on managing anger, where I get in a fight with a koala (it was all his fault), plus a YouTube version of my bichronic piece, renamed The Bipolar Time Warp. This week Therese Borchard of Beyond Blue published my experience on what it was like being guided through a loving kindness meditation while wanting to apply a baseball bat to some idiot's head. But it was a deceptively simple question by Macigrae that appeared in the Ask feature on this site that really got me thinking. "Does being bipolar cause anger problems?" Macigrae asked. That was it. Nothing else. Call it a case of less is more. "Short answer," I replied, "yes." Then I added, "but then we need to break it down." I had never broken down anger before, but - trust me - my first-hand experience makes me an expert. Anger? I've got more words for anger than Eskimos have for snow. Let's begin: Surprisingly, anger is not listed as a symptom of bipolar, but the fine print to the DSM does acknowledge "irritable" mood for hypomania. The next edition to the DSM needs to upgrade "irritable" to "anger," and apply it to depression, mania, mixed states, as well as hypomania, then wrap it in a bow and call it "bipolar anger." (Trust me, I'll be absolutely livid if they don't.) So what are we looking for in "bipolar anger"? Hyped-up anger: This is what I would call my time warp anger, where one's brain is operating at a speed far faster than the rest of the world. You don't have time to wait. If there are five people standing in your way to get to the photocopy machine, you need to knock them down. Now. Simple. What's their problem? It's as if your entire life has been placed on hold. Tech support isn't getting back to you. The frustration builds. The slow simmer becomes a boil. Then all hell breaks loose. Agitated anger: You're up and down at the same time, what the experts call a "mixed state," where depression meets mania. If you're mostly depressed, this would be an agitated depression. If you're mostly hypomanic, this would be an irritable or dysphoric hypomania. If your mixed state involves full-blown mania, you are raging out of control. Think road rage. Your brain is hellishly churning over and you feel like you're crawling out of your skin. You literally want to wring your hands around the neck of the rest of the world, and heaven help the first person who happens to cross your path. Impulsive anger: You're revved up. You can't hold back your emotions. You're reacting impulsively. If you're feeling good, you may buy everyone a round of drinks. If someone gets under your skin, you may pour one of those drinks over the person's head. In this state of mind, your frontal lobes have effectively been taken off line. There is no modulating gray matter standing between your primitive limbic system and your next action. And there's your boss' wife, looking very sexy. (Oh, crap.) And there's your boss. What's a beautiful woman like her married to an idiot like him? (Start looking for another job.) Grumpy anger: You literally wake up on the wrong side of bed, or feel that way. Your brain hasn't booted up right, which makes getting through the day a challenge. Your neurons aren't engaged. If they're talking, they're communicating with great effort over huge chasms. It's as if someone poured molasses through the top of your head. At the same time, some disconnected wire somewhere inside your cranium is emitting random sparks. Sparks swimming in molasses. Your emotions are not exactly combustible, but your frustration is showing. This is definitely not the time for your loved one to come bouncing in the room in some new outfit, asking, "How do I look?" You badly want to respond with something buoyant like, "very very sex-x-xy," only to find yourself snarling, "your butt is hanging out." Anxiety-driven anger: You know the feeling. Your hot date hasn't shown up. The food is going to be gone by the time you reach the front of the buffet line. You are wondering if you are going to be paid. Most days, you can handle the situation, but not today. You're amped up. Your thoughts are racing, and you can't control them. Now you feel your world spinning out of control. Pity your poor date when he or she does show up. Or those innocents in front of you in the buffet line. Or the person who has your check in the mail. You are about to make someone's life very miserable. No doubt, you can add many more types of bipolar anger to this list. Also, you probably perceive quite a bit of overlap, as when anxiety meets agitated meets hyped-up. But I trust you get the gist of what I am driving at, namely: Awareness is our greatest ally in these and other situations. Full recognition of what is going on in your mind at any given time is the equivalent of having a reliable oil light on your control panel. When it goes on, you know you need to take preventive action fast, before your entire engine seizes up. If you're like me, you are probably very adept in certain situations and very inept in others. Please share your wisdom with us, as well as where you can use some sage advice. We are all learning. We all need to know. 
 Opening the door on hypersexuality NAMI April 2009 bp Magazine editors note: At every stage of preparing this important article, from interviewing sources to designing the layout, bp Magazine took the utmost care to address the topic candidlyto "open the door" on hypersexuality, as it were. At the same time, we steered away from unnecessarily graphic details, confident that we could tell the story without offending anyone's sensibilities. We hope you find our coverage balanced, tasteful, and helpful. Excerpt from the Spring 2009 issue of bp Magazine: A few years ago, a middle-aged woman from Vancouver, British Columbia, happened to read an article about bipolar disorder and hypersexuality, written by her very own psychiatrist. In all the years she'd been going to see him, she was shocked to realize, this doctor had never once asked if hypersexuality was one of her symptoms. "I wrote to him and said, 'This is me,'" the woman recalls. " 'You never told me about this part.'" Hypersexuality may be the last frontier in bipolar disorder. Even now, despite everything that has been learned about the illness, it's hard to put a finger on how big a problem it really is. The research is limited. Only seven studies have ever been published on the subject and their findings diverge: According to these studies, hypersexuality occurs in 25 to 80 percent of all patients with mania. After reviewing the literature, Manic-Depressive Illness (the 2007 text by Frederick K. Goodwin, MD, and Kay Redfield Jamison, PhD) settled on an average of 57 percent. And that hardly tells the story. For, despite its primal role in human behavior, sexuality remains one of the hardest, most sensitive subjects to dredge up in any but the most cursory details. Which explains why, while hypersexuality is listed as one of the primary symptoms of bipolar in the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition), many psychiatrists refer to it almost as an afterthought - if at all - when forming a diagnosis: Racing thoughts? Check.Insomnia? Check.Wild mood swings? Check.Unrestrained spending sprees? Check.Hypersexuality? Um... "Like, what do you mean?" demands Andy Behrman, who became a poster boy for bipolar disorder with the 2003 publication of his edgy, sexually frank, and popular book, Electroboy: A Memoir of Mania. "Am I having sex with strangers? Yes. Constantly masturbating? Yes. Can I get myself to a place where I'm fully satisfied sexually? No. As much as I want to shop, buy, and make money, that's as much as I want to have sex." Though hypersexuality may present itself as just one aspect in a constellation of problems, it is often the most destructive and challenging part of bipolar disordertroubling families of young children suffering from juvenile hypersexuality, ruining marriages, generating life-threatening health problems. "The one thing I regret is what I did to my husband," says Bev, a middle-aged woman from rural Quebec who was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago. "He was a good man and we would have had a good retirement together." Bev was diagnosed with bipolar in 2006, following years of unrelenting depression and anxiety. She had a strong family history of mental illness: Her mother died by suicide; her daughter is clinically depressed. But it wasn't until Bev reached her early 40s that her sexual impulses underwent a sudden change. She began "doing things I had never done before." It began with extramarital affairs, mostly with younger men: "It was as if my husband couldn't see what was going on. He finally asked me and I said 'no.' The second time he asked me I couldn't lie," Bev recalls. At least one study found that hypersexuality appears to play a larger role in women's lives than in men's. The 1980 study, led by Kay Redfield Jamison, PhD, a clinical psychologist generally regarded as one of the foremost experts on bipolar disorderand one of its most well-known sufferersreported that women with bipolar tend to be far more sexually provocative and seductive than their male counterparts. Further, Jamison found that twice as many women as men reported sexual intensity as "very much increased" during hypomania. The women in her study also rated sexual intensity as the most important and enjoyable part of mania. Despite such findings, personal sexuality is a subject often avoided on the psychiatrist's couch. Indeed, patients complain that their doctors rarely want to hear about it. Whatever insights they've arrived at have come by way of friends and fellow patients, they say...

 Spotting the Early Warning Signs of a Bipolar Mood Episode by Candida Fink MD April 14, 2009 You may be able to short-circuit a developing mood episode through early intervention, but to do so, you must first be able to identify the early warning signs. In this post, I point out some common early warning signs of an oncoming bipolar mood episode (depression, mania, or mixed) and ask you to share your early warning signs. One of the most challenging aspects of bipolar disorder is that those who have it often lack insight, meaning that in the midst of a major mood episode, their mood radar stops working. Consider teaming up with a loved one you trust to provide the objective insight you need. Remember: The earlier you intervene, the better chance you have of keeping a full-blown mood episode at bay. Bipolar Depression Major depression is usually easy to recognize. Youre exhausted. You feel a deep sense of despair. Perhaps you even feel achy. Youre dragging your body through this thing called Life. The early warning signs, however, can be difficult to detect: Loss of interest in activities you generally find pleasurableFatigue or decreased energyDoing any little thing feels unbearably difficultDiminished activity or social withdrawalSleeping too much or not able to sleepUnexplained aches and painsWeight loss or gain or decreased or increase appetiteUnexplained sadness that wont go awayFeelings of guilt, worthlessness, or indifferenceLowered self-esteem or heightened self-criticismA sense of hopelessness or despairIrritability, anxiety, or angerSlowed thinking, movement, or speech or inability to concentrateDisorganization or inability to make a decisionImpaired memoryIncreased focus on death or mortalitySuicidal thoughts or ideation  thinking about or planning how the suicide would be committed Bipolar Mania The early warning signs of mania are typically labeled hypomania and often result in feelings of euphoria and power  not exactly the sorts of things people typically seek treatment for. However, this is exactly the phase of a manic episode that requires early intervention. One of the most objective symptoms to monitor is sleep  needing less sleep is a huge red flag and often easier to see than the mood changes of mania. Routinely keeping track of how much sleep you are needing and getting can be valuable in tracking mood states  impending, existing, and receding. Common warning signs of an impending manic episode include the following: Increased energy or a sense of restlessnessDecreased need for sleepRapid, pressured speech (cant stop talking)Inappropriate/impulsive speech or behaviors  like being overly honest and openOverspending on shopping sprees, vacations, and so onTaking on many new tasks and projects  thinking of and entering into lots of schemes and grand ideasIncreased sexuality, possibly including inappropriate sexual behavior or promiscuityImpaired concentrationRacing thoughts, typically jumping from idea to idea (flight of ideas)Excitability or irritabilityAnger or hostilityInflated self-esteem  feeling like one is special or better than others  having special powers or insights (commonly referred to as grandiosity) When mania begins to escalate, loved ones can lose their insight, as well, especially if they feel threatened or hurt. Its important to keep in mind that this is the disorder saying or doing hurtful things and not the person who has bipolar. This can be extremely difficult, but do your best to get your loved one the medical help he or she needs. Notice that irritability and anger come up in both poles  these are common signs of both mania and depression. Because these feelings are so generic, they can be hard to use as a marker of a specific type of mood episode, but they are markers of brewing mood changes. Similarly, impaired concentration is often part of both depression and mania; the difference typically centers on the quality of the thinking  slowed and dulled in depression versus racing and feeling exceptionally clear in mania. Mixed Episode A mixed episode is the worst of both worlds. It includes symptoms of both depression and mania occurring every day for at least one week. If you notice the early warning signs for depression and mania alternating or co-existing over the course of a typical day, its usually a sign that a mixed-mood episode has arrived or is fast approaching. One minute you feel as though you can conquer the world, and the next you feel as though the weight of the world is crushing you  or you feel both sensations at the same time  a horribly disorienting and painful experience. Candida Fink, M.D. and Joe Kraynak, authors of the Bipolar Blog, are also authors of Bipolar Disorder for Dummies. 
 I`m hoping that someone may be able to help or advise me on what to do. I recently started dating a 33 year old woman, I'm also 33, things have moved at a very fast pace between us and we seem to really hit it off. This woman i have found to be really interesting and she stimulates me in mind, body and spirit. Okay this is the problem that i have,this woman has a history of Bipolar, self harming and bulimia. She has overcome the latter two but still has mild bipolar. When she was at her lowest point four years ago she was found by another woman who helped her. This woman was following a shamanic path called the Peruvian Medicine Wheel, so the woman whom I'm dating joined the group. My girlfriend has taken to this medicine wheel completely. It is now a massive part of her life and the woman who took her in is in my girlfriends own words "everything" to her.My girlfriend has been single for the entire time that she has been in this group, the leader woman has in the last year found a man to share her life with who has also joined the group. My girlfriend wanted to find a man to join her on her journey. So after dating her for a while and doing all the normal dating things like eating out, going to the movies, bowling, etc., etc., she then introduced me to the group. I participated in what was called a fire ceremony where i had to shake a rattle and chant. After the ceremony the leader woman said that she had seen a serpent that had looked at me and said "who is he?". This made me feel as if i was being questioned as to my intent,i went along with an open mind to experience something that i had never experienced before and was made to feel very much like an outsider. I felt that this leader woman saw me as a threat. The house of the leader was very unhygienic with mice running around the kitchen work surfaces. I wasn't comfortable in this environment, so things weren't looking good. I didn't want to tell my girlfriend that i didn't really like this leader woman and that i never wanted to be in her house again as i didn't want to upset my girlfriend, but of course i had to tell her. My girlfriend said she couldn't see how we could continue as the group are a massive part of her life, that she had told the leader what i had said to her, that the leader was very angry and didn't want anything to do with me... Things were looking really bleak. We broke up at that time. A few days later we saw each other again, we had a wonderful time together, then she called me a couple of days later to break up with me, saying that she noticed that i had tendencies for being jealous, possessive and short tempered. i agreed with her that i do have some of these tendencies, but in a volume that is probably quite normal in certain situations... Well maybe I'm a bit worse than the average. Anyway, she was calling it off again. I got angry and decided the only way to really end it was for me to be horrible, so i told her where to go, what i thought of the situation she was in and what she should do. I was rude and hurtful to her, something which i regretted doing almost as soon as i did it. A week passes and we get in contact again. Everything is great. We both think about each other all the time. We do the same things and think along the same lines. So we spend another weekend together. I take her out and treat her with kindness which makes me happy to see her happy. We talked a lot and decided to just go with the flow and that everything would work itself out in time. Today she contacts me saying that the leader is really off with her and that she feels torn. She keeps crying all the time because she doesn't know what to do. She knows I'll never be accepted in the group because of how i feel and what i have said. She wanted someone to walk the same path as her but realises that it wont happen. I keep trying to tell her that it`s okay to have different interests, that i don't want her to give anything up, that it'll be okay, that I'm still here for her and that we can be good together. I'm clueless as what to do, because she has a history of BPD. i don't want to be the cause of her misery, she has been in the comfort of this group for four years now and has kept her BPD in check... What can i do? Please help me if you can. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Jeff. 
 Folic acid may benefit bipolar disorder patients By Mark Cowen, Medwire News 03 April 2009 Acta Psychiatr Scand 2009; Advance online publication Bipolar disorder patients in an acute phase of mania may benefit from treatment with folic acid as an adjuvant to sodium valproate, research suggests. Adequate levels of folate are crucial for proper brain and body functioning, write Ashkan Behzadi (Iran University of Medical Science, Tehran) and colleagues in the journal Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica. They explain: Studies have reported that patients with mood disorders such as major depression and both phases of bipolar disorder have low plasma, serum or red blood cell folate concentrations, and a recent trial on mood disorders showed beneficial results from supplementing antidepressant medication with folic acid. However, the researchers add: To date there has been no study to determine the effect of folic acid in the mania phase of bipolar disorder. To investigate, the team recruited 88 clinically manic patients, aged an average of 35 years, with type I bipolar disorder. The participants were divided into two groups to receive either sodium valproate plus folic acid or sodium valproate alone for 3 weeks. The severity of mania was assessed using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), with higher scores indicating more severe mania symptoms, at the beginning of the study, and again at the end of the first, second and third weeks. At the start of the study, mean YMRS measurements were similar in both groups, at 34.0 in the folic acid group and 34.7 in the control group. However, mean scores fell to 26.7, 18.1, and 7.1 after the first, second, and third week of treatment in the folic acid group, compared with 27.3, 20.7, and 10.1, respectively, in the control group. There was a statistically significant difference in YMRS scores between the two groups after 3 weeks of treatment, says the team. Behzadi et al conclude: Based on our findings, folic acid seems to be an effective adjuvant supplement to sodium valproate in the treatment of the acute phase of mania in patients with bipolar disorder. However, they add that further research is needed to confirm their findings and to see whether the benefits are applicable both to patients with normal folate levels and to those with folate deficiency.

 From Bipolar Darkness, the Empathy to Be a Doctor By ELISSA ELY, M.D. March 17, 2009 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.  By 35, Dr. Alice W. Flaherty had led a life of traditional overaccomplishment: undergraduate and medical degrees from Harvard, a Ph.D. in neuroscience from M.I.T., research in movement disorders, articles in leading neurological journals. Then, in 1998, she delivered stillborn twin boys. In the grief that followed, she grew manic: poetic, metaphorical and long-winded. She wrote everywhere, up and down her arm, over and under any serviceable piece of paper. She also wrote more traditionally, producing neurology handbooks, autobiographical meditations and, in 2004, a best-selling book, The Midnight Disease: The Drive to Write, Writers Block and the Creative Brain (Houghton Mifflin). Her grief eventually subsided. Her newly uncovered bipolar disorder did not  to the benefit of her patients. Dr. Flaherty, now 45, is director of the movement disorders fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital and an assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School. But those technical descriptors do not begin to capture the way she uses the racing mind of her manic phases to drive her ideas into forceful, highly personal treatments. Doctors tend to see patients with an overtone of category, said the writer Rose Styron, whose husband, the late novelist William Styron, was a patient of Dr. Flahertys. Alice never did. She understood Bills depression and his movement problems. But she really understood his needs, appetites, moods, guilts, sadnesses and potential pleasures. These days, Dr. Flaherty is preoccupied with the neuroanatomy of empathy  especially the mirror neuron system in the insula, cingulate and inferior frontal parts of the brain, which become active when one person witnesses another experiencing emotion. The routes to her interest were interconnected and highly personal. What made me empathic was my depressions, she said recently. Peoples emotions were pounding me in the face. The mania is like wasps under the skin, like my heads going to explode with ideas. But the depressions help the doctor aspect of me. When Dr. Flaherty lost her first set of twins (she and her husband, a book editor, are now rearing healthy twin daughters), she experienced a natural yearning for empathy from her own doctor. But as a scientist she wondered, was she yearning for his empathy or an appearance of empathic actions? Years later, she consulted on a pilot for a television drama based on her life: doctor develops mania after personal catastrophe. Although the show never got off the ground, the experience became a roomful of mirrors and mirror neurons, for who better to teach empathy to a doctor than an actor? The actress playing me was trying to pick up my mannerisms. At the same time, she said, recalling professional lessons learned, I was trying to pick up hers, because she was much more convincing than I am  she had a little smile that was triumphant, but also just so happy for the patient. I was imitating her imitating me. The office in which Dr. Flaherty writes is one floor down from her movement disorders clinic at Massachusetts General  filled with fossils and masks, neurological instruments pinned to a corkboard, books by Darwin, Mann and Virginia Woolf, posters of seminars and art exhibits based on The Midnight Disease. Letters run up the back of her wrist. They are one consequence of hypergraphia, the overwhelming urge to write; she writes during manias and edits during depressions. (She keeps the illness under control with medication.) Dr. Jerrold F. Rosenbaum, chief of psychiatry at Mass General, says he used to get notes from Dr. Flaherty on napkins. I save everything she sends me, which I dont do with anyone else, he said. She has enhanced theories of the mind  enhanced in quantity, quality, volume and intensity. The wrist notes could be on any of a dozen topics. They may be more thoughts on empathic pain, or about research she is conducting on the side about light boxes and creativity in Harvard undergraduates. Maybe they are about the informal consultation she made several years ago to an Off Broadway adaptation of A Dolls House, directed by Lee Breuer, a former colleague of hers at the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard, where they were both fellows in 2005. When weeping during a scene, the actress who played Nora was alarmed upon noticing that the mascara ran from her left eye more quickly than from her right. Dr. Flaherty reassured her that the neurology was normal: the right brain, which controls the opposite side of the body, also controls negative emotions. Therefore, one side seems, and is, sadder than the other. This will go in Dr. Flahertys next book, which will be about the neurobiology of illness behaviors ranging from hysteria to stoicism, and, of course, empathy. In the movement disorders clinic, she follows about 130 patients  the stable ones annually, the still suffering every few weeks. She specializes in deep brain stimulation; electrodes are implanted in the brain to treat Parkinsons disease, tremors, dystonias and depressions. Within this specialty, she has developed a subspecialty appropriate to someone still struggling with her own moods. People can become manic or depressed as a side effect of deep brain stimulation, said Dr. Anne B. Young, director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease at Mass General. Alice is a master at managing this. Dr. Flahertys explanation was simple. Neurology and psychiatry should be treating the same organ, she said. At a recent clinic day, she managed to look professional in ski pants and a Spandex top, without a white coat. The patient who arrived was far more elegantly dressed. For years, the woman suffered intractable depression. Brain stimulators were implanted in both frontal lobes, near an area called the anterior cingulate cortex. So far the treatment, augmented with medications, has been more successful than drugs alone or electroconvulsive therapy. On this day, though, she was not feeling hopeful. Theres a parasite eating my brain, she said. Im dull, dumb, mindless. Dr. Flaherty leaned forward. The one thing I can say is, I believe you, she said. I believe you used to be smarter, and your brain worked better. It took you eight years to feel your brain was intact, didnt it? the patient asked with longing. For me, Dr. Flaherty replied, it wasnt memory, but getting my brain to feel right. The psychiatrists said, You should get used to this as your new normal, but I never did. It was always alienating when people said, Oh, thats just bipolar illness talking. No, hello  thats me. The woman held a programmer, a device that looked like an electronic toll tag, to each side of her chest. Stimulators still on, everything looks good, Dr. Flaherty said. She made notes in the chart before changing the parameters  volts, microseconds per pulse, hertz  that are the map of this world. Feel any tingling? Experimentally, she turned both batteries off. Did you turn them back on? the patient asked anxiously. Afterward, Dr. Flaherty reflected on the anxiety. Its no fun feeling your thoughts are being controlled by an electrode, and someone else is holding the clicker, she said. I love the sensation of giving people their own clickers. I say, Here, you can have your own, Ill teach you how to use it, and within this safe range you can adjust it yourself.  It was an example of physician empathy, but also of identification. For Dr. Flaherty, each day holds reminders of her dual citizenship. Recently, she was interviewing someone with a rare brain lesion when her cellphone rang. She was needed for another interview across town in front of a class of Harvard Medical psychiatry students. She was the patient. 
 Living with Bipolar Disorder: How to Keep Your Finances Under Control During a Manic Episode By Robbie B 9/16/2007 Millions of Americans are living with bipolar disorder, a mental illness characterized by extreme mood swings and sometimes-erratic behavior. Medications are extremely effective in treating bipolar disorder, but no matter how good a particular medicine is, a person with bipolar disorder may still experience episodes of mania and depression at times. Manic episodes often start out with feelings of being happy and ultra-productive, however, it doesnt take much time for more negative symptoms to appear, such as a compulsion to have sex or spend money. Indeed, many people with bipolar disorder have seen their financial lives ruined due to poor decisions made during manic episodes. Luckily, there are some steps you can take to help keep your finances from getting out of control during a bipolar episode of mania. The first thing to realize is that your bipolar disorder is making you feel like you need to spend excessive amounts of money, so it may take some hard work and self-discipline to keep your wallet in check. As soon as you start to feel a manic episode coming on, you should be prepared to go into damage control mode. Youll want to set a weekly spending limit for yourselfit should be enough money so you wont feel deprived, but not so much that you cant pay your bills. Once youve set an amount, go to the bank and withdrawal that amount of cash, then take your credit cards out of your wallet and leave them at home. By only spending cash, youll be able to keep tabs on your spending more easily, and youll make sure that you dont make any extravagant impulse purchases that you really cant afford. If you find that you cant stick to your weekly budget, it may be an appropriate time to hand some of the control of your finances to a family member or close friend, at least until your mania starts to subside. Pick someone that is familiar with bipolar disorder and your particular illness history, and explain to them that you need help to keep your finances in order until you are feeling more like yourself. This person can hold your credit cards and checkbook, and can help you evaluate any major purchasing decisions that involve spending large amounts of money. Make up your mind that you are doing this for your own future good, and try to trust your friends judgment when it comes to spending money during your manic episode. Finally, try to avoid situations that encourage impulse spending. During a manic episode, you shouldnt go to the mall just for fun or surf shopping websites just to look around. If you have something you need, go to the store with just enough money to buy it, and dont spend time browsing or window shopping. If youre still feeling compelled to spend lots of money after a week or two, you should ask your psychiatrist if it might be time to adjust your bipolar medication. The symptoms of mania, like the compulsion to shop, are one of the most difficult aspects of bipolar disorder to deal with. Luckily, by using a little commonsense and following this advice, you should be able to navigate the choppy waters of bipolar disorder without spending every last penny you have. 
 New Treatment Approach Needed For Management Of Depression With Bipolar Disorder ScienceDaily Feb. 11, 2009 In a study published in The American Journal of Psychiatry, a team of researchers led by Mayo Clinic psychiatrist Mark Frye, M.D., attempted to identify what factors make some people with bipolar depression more likely to experience treatment-emergent mania (TEM). Bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, is a mental illness characterized by severe mood instability that can be serious and disabling. The deep mood swings from high (mania) to low (depression) may last for weeks or months, causing great disturbances in the lives of the person who has the illness, along with family and friends. Drugs known as mood stabilizers have proven effective at controlling the manic phase of the illness, but treating the depressive phase is more problematic. Antidepressants, although effective for some individuals, can trigger a rapid mood switch from depression to mania, a phenomenon called treatment-emergent mania. "TEM is a serious and sometimes volatile adverse event, and we wanted to better understand who was at risk for developing this problem," says Dr. Frye. People experiencing mania often exhibit poor judgment and impulsivity that can lead them to engage in highly unsafe or personally damaging behaviors, resulting in hospitalization, arrest and/or incarceration. Dr. Frye's team did a secondary analysis of data obtained in an earlier study led by Robert Post, M.D., and the Bipolar Collaborative Network. In that earlier study, researchers followed 176 study participants diagnosed with bipolar depression to measure the effectiveness of three different antidepressants. The secondary analysis led by Dr. Frye focused on 44 patients who experienced TEM after starting an antidepressant. Dr. Frye's team compared this TEM group to 84 patients who responded favorably to an antidepressant and 44 patients who stopped taking the antidepressant due to lack of effectiveness or worsening depressive symptoms. "We found that people who had minimal manic symptoms or a "mixed depression" presentation were at greatest risk for experiencing TEM," says Dr. Frye. Experts have begun to acknowledge that the common understanding of bipolar illness, once thought to be a disorder with two distinct phases (a manic upswing and a depressive downswing), may be incomplete. A recent study of over 1,300 patients conducted by Joseph Goldberg, M.D., Mount Sinai School of Medicine, reported that two-thirds of the depressed bipolar patients had minimal or mild manic symptoms "mixed" together. "We're learning that this illness does not occur in two neat, clear-cut phases, but rather a mix of the two," says Dr. Frye. "Our data would suggest that people with mixed depression may need to stay away from antidepressants and work with their health care providers to find alternative treatments, such as mood stabilizers, to help manage the depressive phase of their illness." Further research is encouraged to better understand the best treatment for these mixed presentations. 
 Is this typical? It seems that when I am depressed, (like this morning till about 5) and then tonight my mood went way high! Grr! honestly, I hate bipolar! When I am up, I am too trusting and gullible and when I am down I feel paranoid. I called my doctor today and he says it varies. I am curious, what is your bipolar experience of up and down moods? Also, it seems that my meds are constantly increased. I am taking Zoloft(200mg) lithium(1500mg) and Serequal now 150 mg. (this is approved by doctor) I have been diagnosed bipolar II, and I was wondering do you think I may end up bipolar I? I am also OCD, and PTSD! Curious of your opinion after getting my docs opinion! 
 Mood Swings and Bipolar Disorder WebMD January 26, 2009 The mood swings of bipolar disorder can be profoundly destructive. Depression can make you isolate yourself from your friends and loved ones. You may find it impossible to get out of bed, let alone keep your job. During manic periods, you be may be reckless and volatile. Picking up the pieces after mood swings can be hard. The people whom you need most -- especially your friends and family -- may be angry with you or reluctant to help. The best way to avoid these mood swings is to get treatment for bipolar disorder. But unfortunately, periods of hypomania, mania, or depression aren't completely preventable. Even people who always take their medication and are careful with their health can still have mood swings from time to time. So that's why it's important to catch changes in your mood early before they develop into something serious. Mood Swing Triggers in Bipolar Disorder At first, mood swings may take you by surprise if you have bipolar disorder. But over time, you might start to see patterns or signs that you're entering a period of mania or depression. Aside from a shift in your mood, look for changes in your: Sleep patternsEnergy levelAlcohol or drug useSex driveSelf-esteemConcentration You may also discover particular "triggers" -- situations or events that can provoke a period of mania or depression. Some people find they're more likely to become depressed or manic during stressful times at work or during holidays. Many people see seasonal patterns to their mood changes. Of course, not everyone can identify triggers. Also, some triggers can't be anticipated or avoided, like a serious illness or a traumatic event. One good way to see patterns or triggers in your bipolar disorder is to keep a journal. Make note of big events, stresses, your medication dosage, and the amount of sleep you're getting. Over time, you might see some patterns emerge. If you know what your triggers are, you can prepare for times when you might be most vulnerable. Ask for more help from coworkers. Have your family and friends check in more often so you get extra support. If you see the signs of potential trouble, get help. Don't wait for the mood swing to pass on its own. With quick intervention, you might be able to stop a very minor mood swing from becoming a serious problem. The Appeal of Mania in Bipolar Disorder When people with bipolar disorder are depressed, they almost always know that something is wrong. Nobody likes feeling that way. But it's different for people who are hypomanic or manic. Often, they don't think anything is wrong. Or if they notice a difference in their mood and personality, they think it's an improvement. Mania and hypomania can be seductive. You might feel more energized, creative, and interesting. You might be able to get extraordinary amounts of work done. So what's the problem? The fact is that manic phases often turn destructive. Some consequences of a manic episode can't be undone. You can wipe out your savings account. You can have affairs that ruin your marriage. You can lose your job. Most dangerous of all, mania can make you do things that risk your life or the lives of others. Although hypomania or mania can feel good at the moment, in the long run, you'll be happier, healthier, more productive, and more successful if you can maintain a stable mood. 
 sorry for posting again. I just felt like i needed to. my moods are going downhill. My head is spinning with thoughts, conversations and songs. I couldnt sleep last night because of all the thoughts. I am getting agitated and irritable and very annoyed. I am trying to keep to myself. I think I might need a medication adjustment but I dont see my T for a few weeks still. I hope there is a cancellation. thanks for listening to me. 
 Pure Hypomanics: Living Zippedy Doo Dah Lives? by GrrlScientist December 13, 2008 Have you ever met a person who seems to be on a perpetual caffeine high, without all the shaking? You know the type, those few hyperactive extroverts who are always doing things or meeting people, who have an expansive and optimistic mood yet are easily irritated, and who have an overactive libido or who enjoy really risky pass times, like jumping out of airplanes or climbing buildings. According to some reading I've been doing, these are apparently those few lucky people who are "pure hypomanics": they have emotional "highs" without experiencing the outrageous slings and arrows of extreme mood fluctuations that a typical person with bipolar disorder suffers. Until I read this paper about pure hypomanics, I had no idea that it even existed, although I freely admit that I wish I could remain hypomanic forever instead of having to also endure my usual emotional roller coaster. I am not alone in this: apparently, pure hypomanics are poorly studied by the professionals because they rarely end up in a clinician's office. This is probably because pure hypomanics enjoy their mood state as much as any bipolar person does, and like us, they don't want this mood state to be "fixed." But this led a team of researchers to ask: are pure hypomanics just happier normal people, or are they somehow different from them? Are there consequences associated with being a pure hypomanic? If so, what are they? To begin learning more about pure hypomania, a research team based at the Zurich University Psychiatric Hospital set up a study of these individuals. First, they defined pure hypomania as a period of increased activity and decreased need for sleep -- basically, this elevated mood state had to exist without the extreme emotional highs and lows that are typical of those suffering from bipolar disorder. This team identified twenty-three young adults from the general population, and followed them from age 20 to 40 using a test, the Structured Psychopathological Interview and Rating of Social Consequences of Psychic Disturbances for Epidemiology (SPIKE). The SPIKE consists of 90 questions that assess a variety of somatic complaints, including insomnia, headache, and gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory, perimenstrual and sexual syndromes. It also assesses mental health and behavioral issues, including depression, hypomania, anxiety, phobias, obsessive-compulsive and fatigue syndromes, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse and suicidal phenomena. Using the SPIKE to collect information about psychiatric symptoms, the researchers found that pure hypomanics were more likely to use alcohol, drugs or sedatives, and that almost half of them were diagnosed as suffering from either substance abuse or dependence (47.8% as compared to 16.5% of normal controls). Additionally, a significant proportion of the pure hypomanics engaged in binge eating (23.8% as compared to only 7.4% of normals). ... The researchers also analyzed somatic complaints for the pure hypomanics and compared those results with normal controls and found that 70 percent of pure hypomanics reported significant sleep disturbances each week, either a decreased or -- surprisingly -- an increased need for sleep. ... Otherwise, the pure hypomanics did not differ significantly in their somatic complaints from the normal controls. Based on these data, the researchers concluded that pure hypomanics were not normal people with an extra measure of energy, productivity and happiness. Even though pure hypomanics did not differ from normal people in their reported levels of psychic and physical well being, nor in their overall satisfaction with their health, they did differ strongly from normal people in several important ways: first, hypomanics were nearly twice as frequent among the highest income class than normal people and second, they were much more likely to be married, which is consistent with their higher-than-normal social activity and sexual interest. However, the researchers found that hypomanics did suffer consequences of their elevated mood state as well. These negative effects included sleep abnormalities, and pure hypomanics were also much more likely to report addictive behaviors, such as binge eating and substance abuse/dependence -- in fact, they had a significantly increased likelihood of being formally diagnosed with either alcohol or drug abuse or dependence in general. Additionally, when compared to normal people, pure hypomanics also displayed increased aggression, irritability and impulsivity -- the same personality traits observed in hypomanics who suffer from bipolar disorder. Based on the data collected from their small group of subjects, the researchers report that pure hypomania is not a stable mood state. I guess this is really no surprise, but it is somewhat disappointing to me to realize that a person cannot always be in a supercharged state of mind. In fact, the average number of days spent in a hypomanic state in the previous year was one month, with a maximum of just 50 days. So, just as seen in people suffering from bipolar disorder, pure hypomania is a transient, although much-welcomed mood state that appears and disappears like a warm summer breeze. Even though this study was interesting, I caution you to remember that it had so few subjects that it is difficult to identify real characteristics of this potential mood state and to assess the validity of the data themselves. However, this project does serve as a pilot study that begins to further explore the fascinating continuum of mood disorders in humans. Source: A Gamma, J Angst, V Ajdacic-Gross, W Rössler (2008).

 Manic depression killed my career BBC NEWS Magazine December 8, 2008 With the rate of redundancies rising and the number of job vacancies shrinking, unemployment is back in the headlines. But for millions it never went away. As part of a series on Britain's jobless, one man whose career was shattered by illness explains how and why lack of work has touched his life. For Richard Bassil, 46, work was not just work, it was his life. But for the past seven years he has existed without it. Now he feels he has a "mountain to climb" to ever return to where he was. Richard, who is single and lives in a garden flat in Southampton, is one of more than two million people in Britain who are not in work - and not seeking work - because they are long-term sick. Despite being diagnosed with bipolar disorder - manic depression - in his early 20s, he had maintained his career as a design draughtsman for almost 17 years before things hit the buffers. "When I hear friends say they wish they'd won the Lottery and didn't have to work, I say you don't realise how much you'd miss the job. You don't realise how much of a part of your life it is, until it goes," he says. Working wasn't always easy, and there were problems along the way. Sometimes Richard became so unwell he had to be admitted to psychiatric hospital. At one stage his bosses turned up at his bedside to make him redundant. "I was amazed that they considered that a good idea," he says. But overall he was coping, was finding jobs and contract work and had established the right level of treatment to stay well. In 2001 things changed after the anti-psychotic drugs he was taking were withdrawn from the market. About the time he switched to a different treatment, he attempted suicide and ended up in intensive care for eight days. "I lost my contract after that, and my employment agency stopped offering me work." Bipolar disorder is an emotional condition, which causes people to swing between the highs and lows of mania and depression. Where previously Richard had experienced more highs and less depression, after the suicide attempt things changed. "After that it was very long periods of depression, as opposed to the multiple high moods - which I could work with as long as they were controlled. High moods can actually be advantageous in a work situation because you tend to be more alert, more able to associate ideas. It's a positive thing at one level, and a destructive thing when it gets severe." An episode of severe mania for Richard usually ends in him being sectioned under the Mental Health Act, which has happened about once a year since he stopped working. After the high, always, comes the depression. It usually lasts for months on end. "You become totally inactive, lacking any motivation and your thinking becomes very negative. You become demoralised and withdraw yourself from social situations." Where possible Richard occupies himself with projects at home, voluntary work and attending music and woodwork sessions at a social services centre. He practises guitar most days, tries to keep stimulated. He has pressed for a new drugs regime, and plots out "mood charts" to keep tabs on his state of mind. "It's about coping." He thinks about how and when he can return to work. Often, when he is in a high mood, he will start making plans on getting jobs or running his own business. But then the mania takes over, and it is back to square one. The fact that Richard loved his job so much was a positive force in his life. But it was also part of the problem. "Something I suffered from early on in my life, and still do to a certain extent, is a wish for perfection and a fear of failure. Those are not necessarily good traits in terms of not letting yourself become overwhelmed." His illness would often escalate at the end of large projects, as the pressure released and he "let go", he says. 'Trapped' The erosion of his confidence since becoming unemployed is a further barrier to working again in the future, which is part of the vicious cycle many jobless people describe. "I wonder whether I could ever go back to the job I did. Engineering is my love, and it's finding something that would give me the same sense of satisfaction and use my skills." And convincing an employer to take him on after seven years of not working is hard to imagine, he says, not least because even if his health stabilises he cannot guarantee he will not become unwell again. "In the past I've hidden my illness when going for job interviews, but now I couldn't do that. And it would be impossible given the length of time." Meanwhile he gets by on Incapacity Benefit and low-rate Disability Living Allowance, which gives him about £84 a week for food, bills, clothes and general spending. His rent and council tax are covered by benefits. "It's not a lot of money but if you're careful with it... it's not really about the benefits, I'd just much rather be working." He feels trapped by the system because it is so hard to keep coming on and off benefits. Occasionally he works with a friend, fitting kitchens and bathrooms, but can only earn £20 a week from it before it starts affecting his payments. 'Scary' It would be better if people with chronic health conditions could effectively stay on benefits permanently, but then work when they were well enough and have their benefits adjusted accordingly, says Richard. Trying to return to a level of work that could completely replace benefits is "scary", he adds. "It seems you've got to jump out of the frying pan into the fire. There's no halfway house. It's a frightening feeling to imagine getting back into employment from the situation I am in." 
 Managing Bipolar Medication Side Effects by Candida Fink, MD, Bipolar Blog December 2, 2008 Sometimes, you may begin to wonder whats worsethe depression and mania or the side effects from the medications used to control the depression and mania. In fact, one of the main reasons that people with bipolar disorder stop taking their medications is because they simply can no longer tolerate the negative side effects. And who can blame them? Nobody likes to gain 30 pounds, feel groggy all day, become forgetful, walk around feeling dizzy, shake, twitch, feel nauseous, or have an anxiety attack. Yet, all of these side effects and more are possible with one medication or another used to treat bipolar symptoms. Fortunately, there are a number of techniques for controlling some of the worst side effects. Not all of them are perfect, but the strategies described here, which you and your doctor may consider, can frequently reduce or even eliminate negative side effects. Warning: Do not try any of the techniques offered here without first consulting with your physician/psychiatrist. We offer these only as possible ideas for discussion. Never make adjustments on your own. Consult your doctor When you experience a particularly unpleasant side effect, a common impulse is to stop or change the medications on your own. Try to avoid this at all coststalking to you doctor is the best way to manage the side effects without causing further problems. Something else completely unrelated to the medication may be going on, and your doctor can help you sort it all out. If a medication adjustment is required, he or she can also assist you with making those changes. Tip: Before you begin taking a new medication, ask your doctor to explain the most common and serious side effects, so you know what to watch out for and what to do if you notice a particular side effect. Ramp up slowly When you first start taking a medication, side effects tend to be more common, because your body must get acclimated to the new substance youre ingesting. Just as ramping up your exercise routine too fast can make you feel ill, starting out with full doses of a medication can cause imbalances in your system. Your doctor will probably increase the dosage gradually to help you avoid or diminish the intensity of the side effects. Dont increase the medication any faster than is recommended. And if you dont feel well as you are increasing the dose, ask your doctor if you can increase even more slowly. Change medication times If you typically take a medication in the morning, and it makes you too drowsy for work, your doctor may recommend that you take it in the afternoon or evening. If you cannot sleep when you take a particular medication at night, your doctor may recommend taking it earlier in the day. Reduce the medication dose One of the most common strategies used to reduce side effects is to reduce dosage. After adjusting medication doses upward to get the desired effect, you can sometimes back down a bit without losing the benefit. This isnt always possible, but it is often one of the first things your doctor will suggest. Switch to an extended-release version of a medication Many medications come in extended-release tablets that release the medication to your bloodstream gradually rather than all at once. Consult your doctor concerning your options. Tip: If no extended-release version of the medication exists, your doctor may recommend that instead of taking one large dose, you take two or more smaller doses throughout the day. This makes taking the medication less convenient, but it may help alleviate the side effects. Add another medication to counteract the negative side effect For example, if you experience weight gain on Depakote, your doctor may prescribe Topamax in an attempt to reduce weight gain. Weve read other articles that recommend dieting and exercising more, which is certainly an option, but such suggestions usually come from people who havent experienced a persistent weight problem or dont know just how frustrating it is to gain 30 or 40 pounds due to a medication thats supposed to make you feel better. However, if you are uncomfortable adding more medications and want to pursue more dietary and exercise strategies, then your doctor may have you consult with a nutritionist or physical therapist, who can give you some ideas on small changes that you might be able to make to at least reduce some of these effects. Change medications If a medication causes intolerable side effects, your doctor may wean you off your current medication and prescribe a new medication thats less likely to produce the same side effect. Sip water Some medications can dry out your mouth, and if you have to talk during the day (as most people are wont to do), this can become very annoying. Sucking on a sugar-free lozenge or sipping water throughout the day can help, but if it becomes too much of a problem, you may want to consult your doctor about other options. Tip: Your local pharmacy probably has some over-the-counter products specifically developed for reducing dry mouthdental rinses and such. Ask your pharmacist about what is available. Caution: If you are on lithium, be very cautious about changing your water intake drastically in any directionup or down. Even taking small sips, if you are doing it all day, could be enough to change the lithium concentration in your blood and change the effects. Reducing your fluid intake can increase the blood level and create lithium toxicity, a potentially life-threatening situation. Including the full range of interventions Although medication is the first-line treatment for bipolar depression and mania, it is not the only treatment. By combining medication with various types of therapies, including psycho-education (books, tapes, and so on), cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, and relationship and family therapy, you may be able to reduce your reliance on medications alone, which could result in fewer side effects. Knowing when to call your doctor In this article, we address some common, annoying side effects and advise you to contact your physician to discuss any side effects and possible adjustments to deal with these. There are some situations, however, that are potential emergencies. If you experience any of the following side effects, call your doctor immediately: Overheating or dehydration: If you feel hot, dizzy, or faint, head to a cooler area or take a cool shower or bath and drink plenty of fluids. Call your doctor to report your symptoms.Chest pain, shortness of breath, or persistent elevated or irregular heart beats: These symptoms could be related to a number or possible side effects or blood level problems and are medical emergencies.Skin reactions: Allergies and skin reactions can happen with any medication and should be reported immediately. Some medications can cause severe and dangerous skin conditions.Seizures or loss of consciousness: Seizures and loss of consciousness may be related to various medication side effects and should be considered a medical emergency.Involuntary muscle movements: Some medications can cause muscle reactions that need to be addressed before they become long-term problems.Suicidal thoughts, severe agitation or worsening of your symptoms: Although these are not necessarily side effects of any medication, some medications may aggravate your bipolar symptoms or simply fail to treat them, leading to thoughts of suicide or other negative emotional and behavioral symptoms. Remember, you dont have to simply tough it out when you experience side effects. Call your doctor and see if there is anything else you can do to reduce or eliminate the ill effects of your medication. 
 Bipolar quality of life and functioning reduced by sleep complaints By Liam Davenport 28 November 2008 Sleep Breath 2008; Advance online publication Among bipolar disorder patients, sleep complaints impair both quality of life and global function, Brazilian scientists have discovered in findings that highlight the need for research into the effect of sleep on neurochemical pathways. Previous studies have revealed that bipolar disorder patients experience sleep disturbances such as frequent nighttime awakenings, poor quality of sleep, reduction in total sleep time, and nightmares. In addition, while insomnia is common during depressive episodes, patients also report hypersomnia, with prolonged nighttime sleep, difficulty wakening, and excessive daytime sleepiness. To determine the impact of sleep disorders on quality of life, disability, and global function in bipolar disorder patients, Larriany Giglio, from Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, and colleagues studied 190 bipolar I disorder patients. The participants were administered the World Health Organizations Quality of Life instrument (WHOQOL-Brief), the Sheehan Disability Scales, and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). The presence of sleep complaints was defined as a present score of at least 17 on questions 4, 5, and 6 of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). In all, 111 patients had sleep complaints. There were no significant differences between patients with and without sleep complaints in terms of gender, age, year of illness, and Young Mania Rating Scale scores. However, patients with sleep complaints had significantly higher scores on the HAM-D than those without, at 12.68 versus 5.36, and a higher age of onset, at 26.94 years versus 23.32 years. Patients with sleep complaints had worse quality of life scores than those without on all domains, with the differences in scores on the physical and psychological domains indicating worse impairment than on the social and environmental domains, at 14.72%, 14.15%, 8.35%, and 6.68%, respectively. Furthermore, patients with sleep complaints had impairments on the Sheehan disability scales of work, social comportment, and environment relative to those without sleep complaints, and significantly reduced GAF scores, at 59.88 versus 66.54. The team writes in the journal Sleep and Breathing: Considering that sleep dysfunction leads to alteration in neurotrophic and transcription factors; these factors are very important for maintaining the normal neuronal plasticity; sleep dysfunction has been described in bipolar disorder, our results suggest that sleep complaints impair quality of life and global function. Abstract 
 'Escaping to the Angels' - Manic Defense A Note on the Passing of the Manic Defense By Greg Mogenson, M.A., Jungian Analyst, London, Ontario This essay examines how some psychologically adroit individuals use creativity as a manic defense against the affects that they cannot bear to experience directly. Conceived within the perspectives of Jungian psychoanalysis, manic creativity is shown to effect a defense against the subjective distress of personal complexes by means of an identification with the archetypal cores of the complexes. This defensive use of creativity, however, may ultimately play a decisive role in healing. Indeed, when considered from a prospective or teleological point of view, manic creativity, for all its insensitivity to the suffering that has inspired it, can also be understood as gradually creating a container in which affects formerly defended against may be received and suffered, felt and grieved. In is in this way that manic creativity, though clearly a defense (and at times a very costly one), participates in the reparative initiative of the self. There is an affect that comes before creativity and an affect that comes, if it comes at all, only afterwards. The first, which cannot be contained or completely experienced due to its traumatic character, splits the psyche and by doing so compels some people to make a creative container in which all that has been split apart can be gathered together again and healed. The second affect, which is sometimes experienced as the apocalyptic unveiling of the first in a burst of repressed affect and insight, corresponds to the actual inhabiting of the container which was formed as a creative defense, and the actual embodiment of the soul which has been made. Said differently, if taken to the limit, the manic triumph one has achieved over an experience may finally give way to a depressive encounter with it. Although it may take years to find the words to formulate the feelings that could not formerly be borne, it may take still more years before one will allow oneself to be moved by those words. In alchemical terms, the endeavour of finding the so-called "words to say it" corresponds to the albedo or `whitening' stage of the process and being moved by the words, to the rubedo, that final stage in which the "soul-work" reddens into life. But reddening into life is not easy, for the mind, having secured for itself an imaginal or linguistic mastery, reflexively eschews the gasps and sobs through which its words and images could be reconnected to the flesh. Loath to admit the extent to which it feels menaced by that rumble of interior thunder which announces the advent of a feeling-toned complex, the manically whitened mind will tend to engage in perseveration more and more grandiloquently. What is sowed in the furrow of denied anxiety, however, cannot be reaped through a similar denial. For it is one thing to "farm[] ...a verse\[and] make a vineyard of the curse" (Auden), and quite another to press the grapes and drink the wine. Avoiding this fact, prolific creativity--be it in transference relationships, work, or art--may become an addiction. Unable to bear what Jung has called "the terrible ambiguity of direct experience," or, more precisely, in a defensive avoidance of the necessary second encounter with it, we may live for a time in what could be characterized as an art-for-art's-sake attitude. Driven by what Freud called the repetition compulsion, the defensively generative person may only be able to live from project to project, relationship to relationship, poem to poem, in creative inflation. This is diagnostic. That a person finds it easier to ape God than to be human is the clearest indication of the rootedness of the manic defense in an archetypal identification. Yet, if the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise. Being a fatality such a condition can only be affirmed; healing comes, if at all, only as a sort of enantiodromia brought on by our perilous persistence in the defensive folly of manic creativity. It will eventually pass. What goes around comes around. Just as the legendary Parsifal, in the grail castle for the first time, missed the grail by failing to ask the fateful question, "Who does the grail serve?", so many of us miss the opportunity for our own healing--not once, but many times--by failing to ask ourselves what our creative efforts mean to us. A young man, in the grail castle of his own experience, vividly exemplifies how narrowly the grail can be missed. Although he seems to ask the decisive question no less than eight times in an eight line poem, the aesthetic relief the poem afforded him for the moment stole the moment, causing him to miss the eternity which lay like a treasure within the moment, because in taking so much pleasure in posing them, he never really put his questions to himself, asking what they meant to him personally. This failure to actually grapple with the contents of the unconscious which have been objectified through the creative process is, of course, indicative of inflation. To the extent that the young man was swept up in the incantational magic of his verse, his awareness of a distinction between the larger self, which had inspired him, and the little self, to which this inspiration had been addressed, was obliterated. Can you paint the last stroke in the corner?Can you live in your own painted room?Can you never the distance to no-where?Can your faith say but never assume?Can you sup in the hallows of breathing?Can you people the angelic snow?Can you dream the world onto a lamb's back?Can you love the undamable flow? Jung sometimes characterized a neurosis as a creative phenomenon, an attempt at self-cure that leaves us all but cured. Unfortunately, this is only too true. Although creativity plays a vital and necessary role in our healing, and though we may even need to pursue it as an end in itself for a time, it must also be recognized (as deconstruction has shown) that creativity does not deliver us across the fissures of our psychic life to the paradise of any signified. And so, like Prospero at the end of The Tempest abjuring his "rough magic," many of us, too, who are psychological magi, must eventually abjure ours if we are not to remain trapped in the glitter and illusion of stylized feeling. It is not just that the trauma from which the psychologically adroit sufferer fled to the angels of archetypal insight must be faced if that person is to live upon the earth as a human being. The opposite is also the case: the angels through whom one has fled to a traumatized identity must also be wrestled. The manic defense itself must be faced if we are to recognize the response of our own essential nature to the impingements we have suffered. For in the deepest sense, our capacity to be traumatized is a secret capacity of the angel who expresses our ambivilence about feeling or refusing to feel a particular event on a priori grounds. "The pearl of great price," an archetypal motif many have latched onto to make sense of a longstanding struggle with emotion, is one such angel which refuses, and thereby, compensates the starkness of our lives by sending us on a quest of discovery. Since the motif is rooted in the psyche's inability to represent negation, however, the promise represented by this priceless pearl is actually obtained, if at all, iconoclastically, if not quite aniconically, in the deconstruction of the pearl back to the very grit against which it was made--i.e., in the emptiness and despair that we formerly could not bear. Eliot was right: The end of all our exploring will be to arrive at the place we have started and to know it for the first time, not merely as a well wrought poetical construction, but also as the scene of our own crime. The healing of the split between psyche and soma, the subtle embodiment of each in the other, occurs, not in the twinkling of the eye it takes for a manic defence to save us through the repudiation of basic needs, but rather, in that paroxysm of grief in which we actually allow ourselves to be moved by what has been moving us in the form of an archetypal identification or manic defense. And though it may have taken many years to create, with the help of the gods who inspire us, the temple for the soul which Keats describes in his poem, "Ode to Psyche," once it is built, we must also, as Keats tells us in the last line of his poem, learn to leave "a casement ope at night,\To let the warm Love in."

 I'm feeling pretty rough today. I had to travel a total of 9 hours in a school bus on Sunday with my client to and from toronto for a raptors game. My back went all kablooey and I am tired and out of medication. Should have called last week to get an appointment but it's too late now, am going next week. I need to go to the clinic to get more. I can't think properly, my heart burn is insane, I feel just so out of it, unmotivated, sore, sad, angry, very frustrated and the anger is driving me nuts!! I just don't know what to do with myself. Got in a fight with hubby this morning so that didn't help things. It's november so this seasonal depression I get is right on schedule. I was SOOOOO hoping that it wouldn't bother me much this year. I'm reducing my celexa on psychiatrist orders, but maybe I shouldn't, maybe if I stay on it it will help me?? I don't know I'm so frustrated with everything. With a full course load in fourth year uni, and feeling this way, I've missed a lot of class lately with being sick in one way or another so that is so stressful on it's own without this to deal with. I just don't know how to help myself. When your brain doesn't work right what the heck am I supposed to do, it's just such a maze right now. 
 Strategies for Treating Bipolar Depression by Candida Fink MD, Bipolar Blog November 4, 2008 Mood stabilizers are usually effective in treating acute mania. Treating bipolar depression, however, is often more challenging for two reasons: Antidepressants tend to be less effective in treating bipolar depression than in treating unipolar depression, especially in people who have the Bipolar I diagnosis (characterized by severe episodes of depression alternating with manic episodes).Antidepressants carry some risk of unmasking mania in people who are prone to it, especially people who have the Bipolar I diagnosis. Because depression is often the pole of bipolar that causes the most misery and carries the highest risk for suicide, its essential that we have a safe and effective way to treat it. Unfortunately, no single solution is safe and effective for everyone. In this post, we explore four options: An antidepressant aloneA mood stabilizer aloneA mood stabilizer with an antidepressantNon-medication therapies Treating Bipolar Depression with an Antidepressant Alone When someone visits the doctor reporting depression and has no history of elevated mood or family history of bipolar, the doctor usually prescribes an antidepressant alone. If you carry a bipolar diagnosis other than Bipolar I  in other words, youve experience depression but never had a manic or mixed (depression and mania) episode  treating your depression with an antidepressant may be a reasonable approach. Discuss this option with your doctor, and be sure to address the possibility of manic switching  triggering a manic episode when treating depression. Ask your doctor to describe any symptoms of manic switching you should be aware of. This way, if you start to cycle into mania, youll be more sensitive to the warning signs. (Have a close friend or family member help you watch for the warning signs, because you may not recognize them yourself.) Treating Both Poles with a Mood Stabilizer Ideally, a mood stabilizer does exactly what its name implies; it stabilizes your moods so you feel good  neither manic nor depressed. And in a subset of people with bipolar disorder, this treatment works perfectly. A few mood stabilizers have proven more effective than others in treating both mania and depression: Lithium prevents both poles of the disorder from appearing, and people can manage well as long as they take their medication. (Unfortunately, lithium doesnt work or keep working for everyone.)Lamictal is another mood stabilizer that often has a good antidepressant effect. It is an anticonvulsant (used primarily to treat seizures) that has been approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder  specifically to prevent recurrence of mood cycles.The atypical agent quetiapine (Seroquel) has recently been approved for the treatment of bipolar depression, and therefore it could treat both poles of bipolar disorder in some people. Note: The antimanic agent divalproic acid (Depakote or Depakene) has not been shown to have an antidepressant effect. Combining an Antidepressant with a Mood Stabilizer Doctors often prescribe a mood stabilizer in combination with an antidepressant for one of the following reasons: The mood stabilizer alone is ineffective in treating the depression.Youre in a high-risk group for experiencing a manic switch on an antidepressant alone, so the doctor wants to reduce the risk by adding a mood stabilizer.Antidepressants alone seem to be ineffective in treating your depression. One of the few medications that contains both an antimanic and an antidepressant in a single pill is Symbyax, which combines the antidepressant fluoxetine (Prozac) with olanzapine (Zyprexa) in one capsule. This medication has FDA approval to treat bipolar depression. Without the benefit of a combination pill, doctors often combine antidepressants with atypical mood stabilizers such as risperidone (Risperdal) and Aripiprazole (Abilify). The jury is still out on how effective these mood stabilizer + antidepressant treatments really are. Youll need to work closely with your doctor to develop a treatment plan thats effective for you. Exploring Non-Pharmaceutical Options Beyond all of the medication managing and adjusting, non-medication treatments are just as essential to the management of all types of bipolar disorder. Recent large studies have shown significant improvement in quality of life and function with the addition of some type of structured and intensive psychosocial interventions  such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Interpersonal Rhythm Therapy (IRT), family-focused therapy, occupational therapy (OT), or a combination of therapies. Dont get lost in the maze of medication treatments to the exclusion of these and other forms of treatment. In many cases, a mix-and-match approach is most effective. 
 Do I Have to Take Medicine Forever? by Candida Fink MD October 31, 2008 People who take medications to treat most serious medical conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and thyroid disorders usually never question the need to be on long-term medication. Many people with bipolar disorder, however, constantly wonder whether they really need to continue taking medication to keep symptoms in check. For a large majority of people with bipolar disorder, remaining on a preventive dosage of a mood stabilizer indefinitely is strongly recommended for the following reasons: A mood stabilizer can prevent future manic episodes.By preventing serious episodes, the mood stabilizer reduces the kindling effect  the tendency for mood episodes to become more serious and more frequent with each episode.A mood stabilizer may provide some protection against the possibility of anti-depressant-induced mania.Lithium and perhaps other mood stabilizers may help reduce the risk of suicide. (Lithium is the only mood stabilizer clinically proven to reduce the risk of suicide.) Does this mean that everyone whos been diagnosed bipolar has to remain on a mood stabilizer and perhaps other medications for their entire lives? Not necessarily: People can be misdiagnosed. How often this occurs, nobody really knows.Brains change. Over time, a brain may grow out of bipolar or at least become less vulnerable to severe mood swings. In addition, a persons life may become less stressful over time  perhaps requiring less medicinal protection.People who have lighter forms of bipolar disorder may find that theyre able to manage their symptoms without medications  for example, with psychotherapy, family therapy, lifestyle changes, nutrition, and/or other forms of therapy. So, to answer the question posed in the title of this article, Go Off Your Bipolar Medications? I recommend the following: If you have a severe form of bipolar, often accompanied with psychotic symptoms that have resulted in multiple hospitalizations and have a history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, a combination of medication and psychotherapy is essential.If you and your doctor question a previous diagnosis, a trial off medication may be useful, as long as your doctor carefully monitors the situation. (You may go off your meds and feel great when experiencing mania, so you need to keep in touch with your doctor to obtain an objective evaluation of how youre really doing.)If no medication or combination of medications seems to be helping, then trying different treatments and therapies may be the only solution. As much as I would like to tell you that simply changing your diet will cure you  perhaps eating more fish high in Omega 3 or taking nutritional supplements  most people, especially those who have the most severe forms of bipolar disorder, respond best to the traditional treatments  a combination of medicine and therapy. (For more about alternative treatments for bipolar, check out Alternative and Complementary Treatments for Bipolar Disorder.) Caution: Never stop taking your medications or adjusting the dosage without consulting your doctor first. Stopping some medications too quickly can cause serious problems. For example, stopping an anti-seizure medication cold turkey can actually cause seizures. Always consult the person whos managing your meds before making any changes. 
 Rapid switching bipolar disorder has complex clinical course By Cher Thornhill 21 July 2008 Bipolar Disord 2008; 10: 597-606 Bipolar disorder patients who experience rapid mood switching have a complex clinical course, characterized by earlier onset and high rates of comorbid anxiety and sensitivity to antidepressants, researchers confirm. "These results support a clinical differentiation of bipolar disorder into subtypes based on symptom stability," says the team, led by Evaristus Nwulia (Howard University Hospital, Washington, DC, USA). The participants included 1143 probands diagnosed with bipolar I (BPI) affective disorder from 10 centers across the USA and their relatives with bipolar disorder. All of the probands selected for the study had at least one sibling with BPI or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (SABP). The participants were interviewed using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) - which has excellent test-retest reliability for diagnosing affective disorders - and were each asked: "Have you ever switched back and forth quickly between feeling high and feeling normal or depressed?" Individuals with rapid mood switching were diagnosed with bipolar disorder when they were significantly younger (18 vs 21 years) than those without rapid switching, the researchers report. These patients had higher rates of psychiatric comorbidities than those without rapid switching, including anxiety (47% vs 26%), substance abuse disorders (52% vs 42%), obsessive compulsive disorder (11% vs 3%), and childhood hyperactivity/learning disorder (36% vs 18%). Rapid switchers also showed significantly higher rates of violent (6% vs 3%) and suicidal (46% vs 31%) behavior, and non-suicidal self-harm (13% vs 6%) than the other patients, the team reports in the journal Bipolar Disorders. After adjusting for potentially confounding factors, the researchers found that the early emergence of symptoms, comorbid anxiety and hypersensitivity to antidepressants remained strongly associated with rapid switching. The findings agree with a previous study, which the researchers say "robustly associated" rapid mood switching with early age of disease onset, comorbid anxiety, suicide attempts, and antidepressant-induced activation. "The idea that some individuals with bipolar disorder experience greater flux than others in their episode frequency and rate of switching is not so much new as it is a potential refinement of concepts variously described in the DSM and the literature as mixed states, ultra-rapid cycling, and affective lability," write Nwulia et al. "The implications of this hypothesis for the understanding of disease etiology remain to be seen." Abstract 
 I'm on epival 750 mgs and effexor 75 mgs . My GP is starting me on lamictal 25 mgs and the first day reduced epival to 500 mgs. On the fifth day I felt good (normal) and by supper time my mod started to change. The day I was so depressed and today I feel a bit better. So can this reduction react so fast? I'm bipolar II. 
 Hi guys. I have a request for those who also have issues with procrastination. There's days when I just want to do nothing, even though I know that I have a lot of things to do. This isn't just during a depressive phase either. After going to my pdoc, I had my meds raised just a little, and I"m finding I'm experiencing a much more stable mood than I was before. So that is going well for me. But I have problems with getting myself to do anything. I'm really trying hard when it comes to homework for school, but sometimes its like I just don't want to do it so bad that I just procrastinate, and then I totally forget about it all together. And going to class is irritating because it frustrates me the way that we learn. There's a lot of group work that is done in class, and the material is repetitive beyond reason. So I get frustrated with going to class and it feels like punishment to go. I prefer to hear lectures on information related to the readings, not do group presentations in class on the material we read the night before. Anyone have any suggestions or ideas as to how to get around these feelings? It's been suggested by a few informed professionals that I get on a mild anxiolytic for the daytime to be able to quiet my mind enough to get through class without having an anxiety attack out of frustration. I just don't want to be there. I will go to school for class, and just totally miss class and sit and study at school. I'm trying to not make excuses, but it's hard after making excuses for so long.

 No switching or rapid cycling with antidepressants in bipolar disorder By Liam Davenport 17 October 2008 Acta Psychiatr Scand 2008; 118: 337346 Antidepressants, when used alongside a mood stabilizer, do not appear to induce a switch to hypomania or mania in patients with acute bipolar depression, European study findings indicate. It has been suggested that use of antidepressants in bipolar disorder patients may induce hypomania/mania and rapid cycling, leading to some guidelines warning against their usage. However, the evidence is not conclusive. To examine whether antidepressants increase the risk for a switch from depression to hypomania or mania, or cycle acceleration in bipolar disorder patients, Rasmus Licht, from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, and colleagues conducted a literature review. The team searched the MEDLINE database, major meta-analyses, reviews, and observational studies, identifying randomized controlled trials of antidepressants in bipolar disorder. They applied the BedfordHill criteria, which focuses on the specificity of the agent, strength of effect, consistency of findings, dose-response relation, temporal associations between exposure and effect, and biological plausibility. Writing in the journal Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, the researchers say that there is a lack of randomized controlled trials, and that all of the available studies contain various forms of bias. They note that the data supporting the efficacy of antidepressants in bipolar depression are conflicting, and that there is no clear consensus on the definition of a switch to hypomania or mania. However, they say that there is sufficient evidence to assert that switching is a natural phenomenon, and that rates of switching did not change after the introduction of antidepressants. Short-term studies into switching during antidepressant treatment, combined with mood stabilizers, all suffer from selection bias and are inconclusive, the team says, and the results do not support the notion that antidepressants induce switching. It is also not possible, from the available evidence, to state that one antidepressant is significantly more likely to cause switching than another. The researchers also write that there is a lack of systematic data on the proposed link between antidepressants and accelerated episode frequency in bipolar disorder patients, but the available information suggests that there is no association. Taken together, the belief that antidepressants (even in combination with mood stabilizers) induce switches and/or rapid cycling is not sufficiently justified by evidence, the team says. This belief may create unnecessary anxiety not only among clinicians but also among patients and their relatives. Abstract 
 I'm starting to feel a wee bit "off" I think with all the stress of school and money and I have a job interview tomorrow...but I don't know if I can handle work with a full 4th year uni course load GAH I'm feeling overwhelmed and having sad thoughts. It's nothing big yet but I'm concerned it is. My psychiatrist recommended me upping my valproic acid, BUT he didn't say this during a sad time, he said it last week when I felt "normal", so I don't fully know why he would say that. It's only in the last week I"ve started feeling sad, tired a lot...so busy up at 6:30 3-4 days a week. 13 hours days, ya know the drill. Anyway I'm thinking I will follow his advice and up it,but I'm also scared that it's going to give me more side effects. Currently i'm at 250mg daily, it's the smallest dose, so maybe not even that effective?? I just don't want to take it and become non functional and mess up schoo, but I also don't want to be so depressed and fluctuate so much that I mess up school that way. I'm just rambling I know. I'm sorry. Does anyone find that at the 500mg daily dose they were more tired? or anything like that?? Thanks!!! Meg 
 I'm diagnosed with bipolar II and ADHD. Depression is my major problem but I could be depressed severely during the day and in the evening I feel much better and wont even think about it. Mornings are awful for me. Yesterday I even felt like dying and had no hope and suddenly in one spark I'm playing poker in a tournament last night and felt like nothing was wrong, normal as can be.. Does this sound familiar? 
 I did one of those quizes on this and it said I may have it and to see my doctor 
 I'm taking testosterone therapy as my level was very low. I was wandering if it has anything to do with moods. As if I raise the testosterone level , my moods will be affected. thanks 
 Back to Work with Bipolar Disorder: Part I by Candida Fink MD September 19, 2008 Many people with bipolar disorder are able to successfully return to work once they’re on an effective treatment regimen, which typically includes one or more medications. In Bipolar Disorder For Dummies, however, we recommend that you avoid stressors and mood triggers – and returning to work, especially a demanding job, can be loaded with stressors and triggers. In this post, we offer some suggestions on how to ease the transition back to work. Every individual and every situation is different. Some people have no option but to return to work full-time and really have very little support from loved ones. Others may have a tremendous support network, an understanding supervisor, and very accommodating co-workers. Some people may even find that returning to work is less stressful than staying home, and they embrace the opportunity to return to work. Following are some suggestions that can help ease the transition back to work: Meet with your doctor first. You may need a doctor’s release to return to work. In addition, your doctor may offer helpful suggestions concerning how to handle your medications in the workplace.Set up a doctor’s appointment for the end of your first work week. By setting up an appointment in advance, you can return to work knowing that if anything goes wrong, you can get in to see your doctor soon.Consider any workplace accommodations that can help you function more effectively at work. Under the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), you have a right to reasonable accommodations, but you can’t hold your employer accountable unless you disclose the reasons why you need special accommodations. If you are dead set against disclosing that you have bipolar disorder, you can always request accommodations anyway, simply stating that these accommodations will make you happier and more productive, but to gain some legal leverage, disclosure is necessary. Remember, your employer can’t fire you for having bipolar disorder. (In Chapter 13 of Bipolar Disorder For Dummies, we recommend some types of workplace accommodations that you can request.)Discuss your return with your supervisor. You’re not required by law to disclose your diagnosis or treatment, but if you feel comfortable disclosing this information, it may make your supervisor a little more understanding and flexible.Tip: You can often predict how your supervisor may react to your diagnosis by thinking back to actions she performed or words she uttered in the past. How accommodating has your supervisor been regarding other illnesses and absences from work? Has she ever made unkind remarks about people who were “nutjobs” or “headcases?” Past behaviors are the best predictors of future behaviors.Discuss your return with one or more coworkers you trust. Again, you have no obligation whatsoever to disclose your diagnosis or treatment. In fact, a disclosure may not always be the best idea. But if you have coworkers you trust, a support person on the job can help you watch for early warning signs and avoid potential conflicts.Lighten the load at home. If you have a partner or other loved one who can relieve some of your burden at home, ask him or her to take on some additional responsibilities or chores or hire help (if you can afford it). If someone else can chip in by paying the bills, picking up the house, cooking, and making sure the kids (if any) are taken care of, at least temporarily, you may feel less stress at work. Note: You may need to submit medical forms and other paperwork to receive sick pay or other benefits, but keeping up on all the paperwork can be quite stressful and difficult when you’re feeling depressed or overwhelmed. Get help from a family member or friend, a union representative, or your employer’s human resource department. Union representatives and HR workers are typically very knowledgeable about your rights and dedicated to making sure that your employer follows the proper legal procedures. From Joe: When my wife, Cecie, was experiencing her worst mood episodes early on, when we really had no understanding of bipolar disorder, her doctor would simply prescribe medications and send Cecie back to work. Looking back, it reminds me of a boxer who’s getting pummeled in the ring being patched up in his corner and then sent back into the ring to get pounded some more. Cecie wasn’t well enough to return to work. The major breakdown made her weak and confused. When she did return to work, her mind was in such a fog that she couldn’t perform her job duties, which understandably increased the stress she was feeling and ultimately led to another mental breakdown and all the fallout that resulted from it. Now, not only did she feel stress, but she also felt like a failure. I think a lot of times people have no choice but to get patched up with a few meds and try to return to work before they’re fully healthy. But if you have enough sick time and a support network in place, I would strongly advise that you avoid returning to work prematurely. Wait until you feel healthy and ready. It will help ensure that your return to work is successful. 
 Dissociative experiences and panic disorder linked in bipolar patients By Andrew Czyzewski 17 September 2008 J Affect Disord 2008; Advance online publication Feelings of detachment from the external world, known as dissociative experiences, are associated with an early age of onset of bipolar disorder and may cluster with panic disorder comorbidity, study findings suggest. Based on this new evidence, the team of researchers behind the study speculates that "bipolar-panic comorbidity seems to configure a unique entity from a clinical, neurobiological, and genetic point of view." Depersonalization is defined as an experience in which the individual feels a sense of unreality and detachment from him/herself. Depersonalization is often associated with derealization, and consists of an alteration in the perception of one's surroundings so that sense of the reality of the external world is lost. Both these phenomenon come under the more general term of dissociative symptoms. "The aim of this study was to investigate frequency and clinical correlates of dissociative symptoms, with special attention to depersonalization symptoms, in bipolar disorder patients," Marco Mula (Amedeo Avogadro University, Novara, Italy) and co-workers explain. They assessed 43 patients with bipolar I disorder and 48 with bipolar II disorder with the Semi-structured Clinical Interview for Temperament (TEMPS-I); the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES); and the Structured Clinical Interview for Depersonalization-Derealization Spectrum (SCI-DER). Lifetime dissociative symptoms were reported by 25.6% of bipolar I disorder patients and 25% of bipolar II disorder patients, defined by a score of more than 25 on the DES (the accepted cutoff score for pathological dissociation). There was no difference between bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder patients in scores of any dissociative measurements. Age of onset of bipolar disorder was negatively correlated with SCI-DER-total score (r=-0.436) and DES score (r=-0.270). A logistic regression model showed that derealization scores, corrected for age and gender, were significantly associated with a diagnosis of comorbid panic disorder (OR=1.22). "Our study suggests that lifetime depersonalization symptoms are correlated with an early onset of bipolar disorder and derealization symptoms with panic disorder comorbidity," the researchers conclude. "The association with an early onset of the disease may suggest the need for further investigation to clarify whether bipolar disorder patients with lifetime depersonalization configure a separate clinical phenotype characterized by other indices of disease severity (e.g. number of hospitalization, number of episodes, treatment resistance)."

 Bipolar isn't simple: there can be many sets of symptoms by Gabrielle J. Melin, M.D. Bipolar affective disorder is a disorder of mood that involves a depressive phase and a nondepressed or manic phase. Bipolar means literally two opposite poles, thus explaining the meaning of the word. It isn't quite that simple, though. People can experience the nondepressed or manic phase in more than one way. The mood during the manic phase can be euphoric or irritable or even a combination of the two. Furthermore, people can experience a "mixed episode" and can have both depressive and manic symptoms during the same episode of illness. The specific set of symptoms is important as some medications, such as Lamictal, are better for a mixed bipolar episode. Medications used to treat bipolar (mood stabilizers) are different than moods used to treat depression. The manic phase is characterized by elevated or irritable mood plus 3 to 4 of the following symptoms happening during the same time period (at least one week continuously): Decreased need for sleep (feeling refreshed on little sleep)Decreased appetiteGrandiosity (inflated sense of self worth)DistractibilityExcessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (buying sprees, sexual indiscretion, foolish business ventures)Flight of ideas (talking and thinking that jumps from one topic to another-racing thoughts)Increase in activities involving school, work or social lifeAgitation The person may also experience psychosis, which means being out of touch with reality. The manic phase is a change in previous life functioning that is not caused by drugs or alcohol. The manic phase alternates with a depressive phase. The Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) is a self-screening tool that can be used in conjunction with a visit to a mental health provider. Mood swings alone do not mean you have bipolar. Borderline personality symptoms can look like bipolar and other mental illness, too. Time and accurate information help to make the correct diagnosis and provide the best treatment.

 Bipolar Medication Non-Adherence Issues By Candida, Fink MD August 12, 2008 Many people with bipolar stop taking their medications at some point in their treatment. This is a reality that patients, doctors, and family members often wrestle with. But its important to understand some of the possible reasons why. Understanding that there are often compelling factors in someones decision to stop their meds can help loved ones approach the problem without judgment. And for people with bipolar disorder it is critical to honestly evaluate why they want to stop taking their medication, because then they can tackle these issues directly and without judging themselves. Non-compliance or non-adherence? Anyone whos ever taken bipolar medication has heard the term non-compliance. It means not doing what your doctor and therapist tell you to do. In most cases, it means not taking your meds as prescribed. Unfortunately, the term carries a subtle connotation that the patient is not being a good little girl or boy. As such, many people with bipolar understandably find it offensive, preferring instead to use the term non-adherence. Outside observers often seem to think that the main reason people with bipolar stop taking their meds is because these people are just irrational, irritable, and obstinate especially when they start becoming manic. Although mania could be a contributing factor in some cases, people often have other reasons for stopping their medications, including the following: The meds dont seem to be working or arent working soon enough.The meds do work  I feel fine, I dont need these medications. Of course the reason someone is feeling fine is often because theyre taking the meds. By the way, this phenomenon isnt exclusive to people with bipolar disorder. Many patients without bipolar disorder who take medications to treat other illnesses stop taking their medications as soon as they begin feeling better even when their doctor and pharmacist instruct them specifically to finish the prescription.The side effects are intolerable. Some of the side effects can be scary and things that nobody would want to deal with, such as weight gain, memory loss, fatigue, and insomnia, not to mention potential medical problems like kidney or liver malfunction.Its a real pain to remember to take the meds at the right time, every day; to find a way to keep track of when meds did or did not get taken; to find out what to do if a dose or several doses are missed, even accidentally; to keep the prescriptions refilled (especially if the insurance company is being difficult). The logistics of taking medications regularly  and the cost, too  can create genuine problems with sticking to them. And all of these challenges can be more difficult when someone isnt feeling well  and can seem unnecessary when someone is feeling fine.Psychiatric medications carry a stigma. In our society, theres a strong undercurrent of belief that medications for treating mental illnesses are only for lesser beings who cannot will themselves out of it. This is a huge issue and one we will discuss in other posts, including Do You Feel Stigmatized by Your Bipolar Medications?Understandably, many people enjoy the high side of bipolar disorder. They feel that the meds flatten them  and take away their creativity and spark. We cover these non-compliance issues in Bipolar Disorder For Dummies and provide some strategies for overcoming the challenges, including the following: The most important first step is to be honest about taking or not taking medications and to deal with it as just another challenge on the journey. It is an expected bump in the road and it is not helpful to think of it as catastrophic.Honest communication with your doctor is critical  some of these problems can be handled, for example, with dosage or timing adjustments or by switching to an extended release version of a particular medication (if one is available).Bringing in other people to help can sometimes ease the logistical burdens.Sorting out the stigma and fear will be an ongoing and necessary discussion as part of solving this problem. There may not always be a simple or obvious answer, but talking honestly and keeping judgment and criticism out of the mix when addressing the issue will go a long way toward finding creative solutions. 
 A new mouse model of mania National Institute of Mental Health Press Release, March 2008 Author: Husseini K. Manji, M.D. (Director, Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program) A major limitation to progress in research and treatment has been the lack of an appropriate animal model for BPD. This work was developed to create such a model based on a genetically engineered defect in the GluR6 gene. The glutamate receptor 6 (GluR6 or GRIK2, one of the kainate receptors) gene resides in a genetic linkage region (6q21) associated with BPD. Kainate receptors respond to the neurotransmitter glutamate, and recent research in mood disorders suggests that the glutamatergic system may play a role in causing mood disorders. Until now, the role of GluR6 in regulating the mood swings of BPD has been unknown. Furthermore, the gene encoding the GluR6 receptor has recently been linked to treatment emergent suicidal ideation with antidepressants in a pharmacogenetic study. Notably, individuals with bipolar disorder are most susceptible to antidepressant-induced dysphoric states. In this study, mice of several strains were used to investigate this issue. Mice who were missing the GluR6 gene were compared with control mice. The mice underwent a series of tests designed to approximate the symptoms of mania. The researchers found that mice that were missing the GluR6 gene exhibited many of these symptoms. They were more active in multiple tests and super-responsive to amphetamine, which is used in animal models to approximate hyperactivity. These mice also exhibited less anxious or more risk-taking type behavior and less despair-type behavior. They also tended to be more aggressive. Notably, BPD is most often treated with a class of medications known as mood stabilizers; lithium is perhaps the best known of these medications. The researchers found that chronic treatment with lithium reduced hyperactivity, aggressive displays, and some risk-taking type behavior in mice missing the GluR6 gene. When biochemical tests were conducted, they also suggested that GluR6 may play a unique role in regulating some of the symptoms of mania. This new animal of mania permits researchers to better understand bipolar disorder and to screen for new treatments that if successful in the animal model can then be translated to the clinic.

 Bipolar Medication Spotlight: Lithium by Candida Fink MD July 22, 2008 People are often frightened when the doctor raises the possibility of lithium treatment  it conjures up all kinds of images from the media and Hollywood of dark, dangerous institutions and wild kinds of symptoms. Patients often look surprised when I mention it  saying, but isnt that for only really crazy people? It is unfortunate that lithium has gotten such a bad rap, because it is one of our best tested, longest used (since the 1960s), and most effective interventions for bipolar disorder. Heres a list of its many benefits: It treats mania.It treats depression.It can reduce the cycling of both mania and depression.Its the only medication thats proven to reduce the risk of suicide in bipolar disorder. There was a long period of time in recent history when doctors were leaning toward using the newer medications to treat mania and bipolar disorder, but as experiences with those medicines have revealed a number of difficult side effects, psychiatrists are moving back to the old standby  lithium. While lithium has its own side effects, they are well defined and can often be reduced or eliminated with adjustments and modifications to dose or other straightforward interventions. Following are the most common side effects: Stomach problemsWeight gainFrequent urinationKidney damageLiver damageFoggy thinkingFatigueTremor Lithium wasnt cooked up in a multimillion-dollar lab. It is a naturally occurring salt that just happens to calm the nerves and, when used under a doctors supervision, has manageable side effects for most people. Because it is often effective in managing both poles of bipolar  mania and depression  it is one of the rare medications that is truly a mood stabilizer for many people. One of the biggest challenges with lithium is that blood levels (the concentration of lithium in the blood) must be maintained in a very narrow range. If your lithium level dips below its therapeutic level, the drug isnt effective. If it rises too high, the drug can become toxic, and severe lithium toxicity can lead to death. So remember: Always take the prescribed dose. Appropriate doses can vary widely from person to person  even people of similar weights. The blood level is the important number in the case of lithium. So dont worry if your dose is very different from someone else you know?Make sure your doctor prescribes regular blood tests to check your lithium levels  at least every few months (more regularly when you first start taking it). The right level is typically between 0.6 and 1.2 mmol/litre but every lab has a slightly different range. And while most people require a level in this range, some people do well in a lower range.Your doctor may also order additional blood and urine tests particularly to check on your thyroid and kidney functions.Lithium levels can rise as you lose fluid, so be wary of hot weather and vigorous exercise, and limit your consumption of diuretics, including coffee and alcohol.If you experience diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness, lack of coordination, blurred vision, or other signs of lithium toxicity, contact your doctor immediately. If you cant reach your doctor, head to the nearest emergency room. Warning: On the Web or at your local health food store, you may hear of a form of lithium purported to be safer: lithium orotate. The theory behind this claim is that the chemical compound delivers lithium to the brain more efficiently than lithium carbonate, the standard compound, so it requires less lithium in your bloodstream to be effective. However, no studies currently show that lithium orotate is effective in treating mania or depression. Taking the recommended dose of lithium orotate probably wont harm you but it also wont help. 
 anyone taking lamictal and what side effects do you have? 
 Smoking interferes with treatment for bipolar mania By Andrew Czyzewski 01 August 2008 J Affect Disord 2008; 110: 126-134 Cigarette smoking is associated with worse treatment outcomes in acutely manic patients with bipolar disorder, research shows. Investigator Felicity Ng (University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) and colleagues comment: "Rather than allowing the passive acceptance of smoking as a prevalent lifestyle habit among patients with mental illness to continue, clinicians could adopt an alternative stance that views smoking as a comorbid condition requiring active intervention." Around one third of patients with bipolar disorder are smokers and the odds ratios for nicotine dependence are estimated to be 3.9 and 3.5 for bipolar I and II disorders, respectively, in comparison with the general population. Studies have shown that lifetime history of smoking is significantly related to earlier onset of the first depressive or manic episode, greater symptomatic severity, poorer functioning, and a lifetime history of suicide attempt, comorbid anxiety disorders and substance dependence. "Despite existing literature investigating the relationship between smoking and bipolar disorder course, the impact of smoking on the efficacy of bipolar treatment has yet to be explored in the context of rigorous clinical trial data," Ng et al. note in the Journal of Affective Disorders. In the current study, the researchers reviewed evidence from three randomized controlled trials of antipsychotics for acutely manic patients with bipolar disorder. From a total of 807 patients, over half (n=467) were smokers. When data from all three studies were pooled, nonsmokers showed significantly greater improvements than smokers on both Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score (DF 787; F statistics= 9.57; P=0.002) and Clinical Global Impressions scale for bipolar disorder (CGI-BP) mania severity scores (DF 787; F statistics= 12.26; P=0.0005). Notably, the impact of active smoking on treatment outcomes became apparent in the medium- to-long-term rather than in the first few weeks of treating acute mania. The researchers note that nicotine, the primary psychoactive compound in tobacco smoke, acts as an agonist at nicotinic cholinergic receptors, mediating the widespread release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate. Since antipsychotics act as serotonin and dopamine antagonists, smoking may interfere with their therapeutic action. Regardless of the underlying mechanism Ng and colleagues advise: "For bipolar and depressive disorders, patients may benefit from being specifically counselled on the importance of addressing smoking as part of their mood disorder management." Abstract 
 I Have Major Depression or Do I? By James July 1, 2008 In the 2007 volume of the Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry there is a study titled Quality of Life Among Bipolar Disorder Patients Misdiagnosed With Major Depressive Disorder. A mouthful, I know. The study hits on some home truths for me. After being diagnosed with depression by my family doctor, I spent two or three years trying different anti-depressants without success. It was an awful period of my life. My doctor labelled me treatment resistant and explained that the medicines were pooping out. After persevering for far too long I decided to see a psychiatrist. Not more than a few minutes into my first appointment with him, he said that poop-out doesnt really exist. What appears to be poop-out, he explained, is more likely the result of incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. He was on the mark. His diagnosis of my illness was bipolar disorder not depression, and I enjoyed a significant improvement in health following appropriate changes to my medications. The conclusion of the study is that people with bipolar disorder that are misdiagnosed as having major depression have a poorer quality of life than those with correctly diagnosed major depression or bipolar disorder. This makes sense to me. If the diagnosis is wrong then the treatment can be ineffective, or even counterproductive. Over time a persons frustration and sense of hopelessness will only increase as the prospects for getting better appear to be vanishing. Its an important fact that bipolar disorder is hard to diagnose. The average length of time from onset to correct diagnosis is over 10 years and perhaps as high as 15. It was more than 10 years for me, and it never occurred to me once that I had bipolar. That is, until after diagnosis when my wife and I scrutinised my past behavior. Hypomania, which is more common than mania, can be hard to detect, especially if you arent on the lookout for it. My conclusion to this? If you are suffering from severe depression, but you arent making progress with your treatment, then it may be worth your while to have a second opinion. 
 Manic: A Memoir - Three Thumbs Up by John McManamy Saturday, June 14, 2008 I could feel the sunlight through my clothes, dilating my pores and flushing my pasty, winter-white skin. I could feel the little hairs along my arms and the back of my neck start to ripple with pleasure like wind-stroked wheat and - Oh my God ... the little hairs. The passage is from the recently-published Manic: A Memoir by Terri Cheney. To Terri, her little hairs are equivalent to the numbers dropping off a barometer. The perfect mental storm is about to make landfall and there is going to be all hell to pay. Terri lived the LA high life as a fast-lane entertainment attorney. Work hard, play hard. Famous clients, high-stakes litigation, wining, dining ... Not to mention the blow-outs, hospitalizations, suicide attempts, busted relationships, and full complement of heartbreaks and horrors and humiliations that go with being born bipolar. Most of the time I never noticed I had body hair at all. You might say hypomania was Terris default setting. You cant survive in her world without it. You have to be a little crazy to make it in places like Hollywood, industries like Hollywood. Emphasis on little, emphasis on crazy. The little hairs love hypomania: the world was suddenly all about textures and tastes and sensations ... The hairs loved a certain kind of crazy, and that was a problem, big problem. A male in the room, invariably Mr Wrong ... How could I ever hope to tell a normal person about the terrors of being happy? A surgeons waiting room is not the time and place for body hairs to be tingling in sexual anticipation. Oh, oh, you think. Here it comes. Where will it end this time? Inevitably, somewhere in the land of bad crazy. But first there is good crazy, great crazy, off-the-charts illegal in 14 states kind of crazy. The hairs can see only the good crazy, the great crazy off-the-charts crazy, but you can see beyond that. Your brain is about to yield dominion to whatever is responsible for animating your little hairs. You desperately want to stop it, but at the same time you dont. Run for your life! the last rational thought you may ever experience is telling you. But it may be too late. Your brain is already rationalizing, churning out irrational thoughts. Your long slow march to the gallows begins with a glad song in your heart. No one articulates the true terror of living life with bipolar better than Terri Cheney. No matter how well we may be feeling, how good our life may be going for us, deep down we know the situation is at best conditional. That any day, any second, without warning - bang! crash! - Ozymandius. Broken pieces. Forgotten rubble. Amend that slightly. With subtle warning. Those little hairs. Those damned hairs! My editor at HarperCollins, Sarah Durand, sent me the book. Manic was her most recent project. William Morrow, which published Manic, is an imprint of HarperCollins. I stuffed the book in my carry-on luggage for a recent cross-country flight, fully expecting it to help me put me to sleep. Lord knows, I needed my sleep. Instead, I was hooked. Manic is a short book, a series of loosely-connected intimate vignettes, like Vermeer depictions of domestic life, candid yet discreet, revealing yet mysterious, bright yet muted, exquisitely detailed yet impressionistic. The thrill of mania, the agony of its after-effects, its all there, but unlike other bipolar memoirs there is no sense of bragging, no regrets. Whats done is done. All that remains is the fear. Terri is out of the fast lane now. She has scaled down her life. She takes time out for simple joys, such as arranging flowers. She has dialed in her meds. This time - maybe - she can make it. But, like the rest of us, there is always the fear, the knowledge that out of the blue, out of nowhere, the illness that we share can descend on her like the staff of Gods wrath. Those hairs. Those damned little hairs. I was wide awake when I got off the plane. I began the book somewhere 35,000 feet over Texas or Oklahoma and finished it as I was taxiing into Ronald Reagan. As soon as I got to my hotel room, I emailed Sarah at HarperCollins. You are the patron saint of bipolars, I enthused. Sarah took a big chance on me. My bipolar NOT a memoir. I like to think Terris book was a no-brainer, but the gifted bipolar writers tend to write books that have nothing to do with bipolar. Yet another - yawn - bipolar memoir? Not this one. 
 You know, I might just have Bipolar II. I'm sitting here now crying. Just out of the blue. Well not quite out of the blue, I had a list of things to do today (about 25), I got about 7 done this morning, two of them appointments downtown (you know, the psych appt., and something else), and a few unexpected todo's. I was hyper, productive, content, and impatient. Keeping in mind that I only got about 5 hours of sleep tonight. I get home and continue working on the list, but get sidetracked and end up spending way too long on one thing. So it turns 4pm, and realize I need to plan out my vacation so I can email it tommorow and oh crap I have to study my algebra and do homework etc. etc., so I start planning the vacation... can't concentrate... too tired.... I start working on algebra, can't concentrate... too tired.... start doing target practice with my rataan bow... can't concentrate... And now the mania has drifted into deep depression. Was gonna have a beer to relax... nah that'll make me even more tired Was gonna have some xanax to relax... nah again, makes me too tired So left with stimulants... exercise, and nicotine. Okay maybe if i can get myself to go out and play some b-ball or jog or bike it'd help.... I agree I know it would.... but I'm afraid of seeing people right now. I don't want to be seen by them. This has been happening alot lately, these cycles, and I was always told that bipolar is a state in which you are depressed for days/weeks/months then manic for days/weeks/months, not manic/elated half the day then suicidally depressed the other half. So me and my doc figured cyclothymia, not bipolar. But these depressive episodes are getting worse and worse. Thinking about SI but didn't cause I got it out with tears. I don't know, am I bipolar? Depressed? What is going on in my head
