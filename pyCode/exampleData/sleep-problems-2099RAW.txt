Hello people, I am in a need of some words of wisdom from fellow insomnia sufferes. I have been suffering from insomnia attacks for the last (almost) 2 years. For the last (almost) 8-9 months is kind of (not completly) in remission (not always). Some days i feel like i never had this (the good days as i call them) but somedays i go crazy (i manage and shortcircuit myself). I get panic attacks, fear, stress and not able to close my eyes. Only with pills i sleep. These days may last from a day to some days (the trigger most of the times is stupit). The problem with the pills is that the next day my brain is like a num.  I want to get ride of this problem and obviously the pills.  Can anyone give me some hints on how to treat these bad days?   Thanks in advance 
Hello.  I wasn't going to post but it's getting to the stage now where i need help. I haven't slept in 4 nights and i have no idea what else to try. If you can think of it, i have tried it: Sleep tea, relaxing music, hot bath, turning off tv early, reading a book, getting up and taking a walk, Kalms tablets, St John's Wort tablets. I can't think of anything else. The more i try to sleep, the worse it gets and i become really agitated and let it take over me, the fact i am not able to sleep. I can't go to work or even eat at the moment cos it's really that bad. I went to my doctors today and he prescribed me with Mirtazapine (15mg) as i have been getting really anxious as well about not sleeping. I'm concerned that these might not help as they seem to be more for depression than anything else. I am going to take 1 tonight and see how i get on, but i'm not very optimistic. If anyone can help me i would really appriciate it.  
Dear all,  Im experiencing the following situation which perhaps some of you can advise me better.   History  Back in 2005, I experienced a sleep disorder condition that lasted everyday for almost a year. I would sleep with ease, but would remember my dreams very clearly and wake up feeling not rested and tired through the day. Prescribed medication did not help. I tried all means i.e. exercising, meditation, melatonin etc, all did not work. But after a year of torment, the condition just randomly left me after a year when I started full time work & undergrad studies.   Over the years  I do still get this problem especially when Im overseas for short / long trips. It seems quite random as sometimes it happens, sometimes it don't.   Present  The same issue revisited me and its Day 6 already. Same thing, I would go to sleep but having very vivid dreams (not nightmares) and wake up feeling tired / unrested. Sometimes halfway through the dream, the ringing of telephone etc (in reality) would suddenly wake me up and it feels as if someone had just pulled you out of the dream. Can anyone advise? Im out of ideas     
Anyone got any ideas? Waking up regularly with a dry mouth, dehydrated and thumping headache, having a glass of water before bed seems to make it worse. Not a typical candidate for an OSA type problem which would potentially give those symptoms.   I guess I'm intrigued to see if anyone has had anything similar? 
Hi all, im john    from a year now, every day, when i try to sleep and i m almost dreaming my mind wakes me up,  this happens 4 or 5 times before i sleep. In afternoon it's even worst, after i wake up 3 times i can't sleep anymore for the rest of the day.  Im doing meditation every day, i'm happy, i have no worries or something that can disturb my mind.  1 year ago i had a really hard time, i was stressed, depressed, and i remember that i had the same problem, but that time there were a lot of emotional problems, and that's because my mind wakes me up.   My question is if my mind used to wake me up to help me overcome my problems, how can i let her understand that i don't need it anymore?  i've tried to ignore and keep trying sleeping, but didn't worked.  Ps: now it's everything alright, im happy no matter what happens. thanks to anyone wants to help me :D. 
Hi. New to this forum so please be kind.  âI have been having problems with my sleep for it seems as long as I can remember now. I can fall asleep very easily at night but I wake up the next morning and dont feel like I have had a good sleep and have no energy and this continues through the day. In the main I can manage to stay awake for however long the day may be but if an opportunity to have a sleep arises I will generally sleep for anywhere between a short nap or a full on sleep. Even if I have a full on sleep I will still be tired at night and still sleep.  âAs i say this has gone on for a while and it has started to impact my mental well being. I seem to be getting a little depressed and anxious. Also my ability to focus has gone. This has affected my work performance and this has probably made the anxiety even worse. âI had noticed over the last few years that I had woken up on a number of occasions unable to breathe in the night. I have had an overnight pulseoximeter test done and am awaiting the results. I have brought one of these devices and recorded a couple of nights sleep myself and they show my So2 levels stay above 90% all night and generally hover between 93%. So from this I assume that apnea is not a problem. The pulse readings do move quite frequently during the night and from a low rate of low 60's go up to 80-90. This happens about 15-20 times during a 7 hour recording. I assume this is maybe just down to moving about during my sleep. âSo I am not sure as to what the cause of this can be. I know at the moment I am mildly depressed and anxious but this is only a relatively recent thing I am pretty sure. âFrom reading I cannot see a similar condition. I have tried meditating in the past and that had no benefit. I am not big on taking pills / medication and generally avoid them like the plague but I am wondering if it is worth trying something that may make me sleep better and see if everything improves from there. âAny help and advice would be greatly appreciated and hopefully somebody has experienced a similar set of issues and got through it ok  Thanks 
I am out of options at this point and am seeking help from anyone.  Towards the end of September 2016 a very stressful event at work triggered a few nights of bad sleep.  Long story short (and I do mean long story), a few bad nights turned into a few bad months, and nearly every night I would wake at 3am and often couldn't fall back asleep.  I had never experienced anything like this before so naturally I freaked out and thought there was something wrong with me and didn't even think it was real insomnia at some points.  I got blood work which all came back normal, yet day after day I would go into work as a zombie.  My entire life became a blur.    Finally, in early December, I began "accepting" my Insomnia as they say to do.  Not freaking out about it, and all that.  Around December 7th I slept rather well during the FIRST night of having this mindset.  For the two months prior all I did was look for any cure to my problem (i.e. Melatonin, white noise machine, sleepy tea, etc. I was a lunatic)  For the rest of 2016 I was finally sleeping well again.  It was amazing.  Then something happened.  Another couple of bad nights of sleep popped up right around New Years.  I woke at 5am for a couple days in a row instead of my alarm at 6am.  I got very upset about this and found myself entering a rebound phase of insomnia.  The first couple of weeks I was losing it again and the techniquies I used to get me out of this hell the first time around suddenly did not work.  Then eventually I really began to calm down but they STILL didn't work.  Again I was in a full fledged Insomnia mode, only now, I had no answers.  Finally, I realized about a week ago, that the #1 thing that seems to put me into a panic when these 3am horrors happen is looking at the clock when I wake up.  Just seeing it's 3 or 4 am, whatever time it might be, would freak me out and often make me unable to fall back asleep.  I would be a clock watcher every one of these nights.  I removed the clock from my room, and wouldn't you know it, that VERY night I slept well!  I did wake up in the middle of the night, but bc I knew there was no time to see, i soon fell back asleep.    The sad part is that this success of anxiety elimination only lasted about 3-4 days, as eventually i STILL continued to wake up in the middle of the night every night, and would think to myself well, I'm awake and i kinda KNOW its probably around 3am (bc i dont see the sun peeking through my window at all) and that began upsetting me again.  I know 3-4 days isn't enough time to magically fix this and start sleeping through the night again, but I just couldn't help myself.  The few nights of good sleep were so amazing, and to think I just couldnt for even ONE night find the way to sleep through the night was giving me anxiety.  I am absolutely lost at this point.  The last two nights, friday and saturday, with no work in the morning, again I have slept horribly.  No clock still, but of course up in the middle of the night, well aware of what is still happening to me.  I am absolutely fascinated yet horrified by all of this.  I cannot believe this is still happening to me, now for the better part of almost FIVE months.  I am 32 and i know i have slept well for all of my life before this.   I do feel this can be beaten and I feel like i have come close to doing so, but everytime i make progress I come right back.  I just want to go back to living a normal life again not being sleep deprived during the day.  It has now reached a level where I have actually began putting cover up under my eyes to hide the purple bags.  That's right, a 32 year old male putting on makeup.  Please help me. 
Hello, I am a student currently researching sleep paralysis for my extended project qualification. It would be most helpful to me to have first hand accounts from people who have experienced sleep paralysis. If anyone who has experienced it could answer a few questions, it would help me out a lot. 1. What do you experience in a typical episode of sleep paralysis? 2. What have you expereinced in your most servere case? 3. What age are you? 4.Do you have a history or are affected by any other mental illnesses? 5. Do you take any drugs, recreationally or medically? 6. Have you noticed anything that particularly triggers episodes of sleep paralysis? 7. Do you do anything to try and stop it happening? 8.How often do you experience it? 9. Anything else you think is important about sleep paralysis in general or personally. Thank you, feel free to answer as many of the questions as you like. 
Hi, I am 51,  7st 8lb, I rarely drink and I don't smoke but suffer from very loud snoring. As you can see I am not a typical candiate for snoring. The trouble is I cannot sleep with my mouth closed, I feel claustrophobic and that I can swallow. It all started about 10 years ago and has gotten worse as time has gone on. I was referred to an ENT consultant a 14 months ago. We did process of elimination. Firstly I had to see a Sleep Apnea conusltant, who suggested I try a manibular device. I purchase one from Boots, tried it out. Seriously these things are not practical, £40 down the drain. Then I had to go for a sleep study, where they noted that I stop breathing 7 times an hour. I was like wow, that's a lot, but apparently this is just mild and wasn't a concern. It was then apprent that I don't have sleep apnea and that I just snore very loudly through my mouth. It seems my tongue falls to the back of my throat and vibrates. So off I went back to my ENT consultant after a year of going through the other processess. He has now said that he will need to operate to rectify my snoring problem. Has anyone had this type of surgery. He really didn't paint a pleasant picture and to be honest it has put me off having it done. Any advice would be much appreciated  
I haven't posted on here for a long time but just need some opinions on this. 6 year veteran of insomnia btw, no help provided.  It's 3am, I have been awake for 4 days (again) and this time I can actually feel my mental health being affected. I'm losing my mind but luckily smart enough to realise it. I knew this would happen eventually, I told everyone around me including family, friends and GPs and nobody took it seriously.   My question is do I put my health before my job? Might seem like a no brainer but I'm going to Thailand in June to try and bring some meaning back into my life (sleep deprivation is literally killing me..) and could do with the extra money. But how am I meant to have a good holiday in a sleep deprived state? When I'm not at work I usually get some sleep, enough to stay sane anyway. Don't ask why as I honestly don't know and it's been like this for many years.   Thanks.. 
Hi guys, I'm new to the site but glad I found somewhere to share my symptoms.  I'm getting a sort of electrical shock when trying to fall asleep.  This electrical shock seems to be described on other sites as 'jumps' or 'zaps' or 'surges of energy'.  It happens not when I'm sleeping but the moment I am about to fall asleep.  Its like a sort of butterflies feeling in the stomach and then a rush/surge of energy to the brain which gives you a 'jump' and electrical feeling in the head and sometimes upper body.  The more extreme they are sometimes produce a twitch in maybe the arm or leg.  Its not painful but I guess is quite scary when it happens.  These can happen numerous times a night.  Many friends/family I have spoken to say this is normal and they are familiar with the symptoms (I understand what they mean as it can be quite similar to when you suddenly wake from a bad dream) but mine seem to be a lot more often and extreme.  I know my symptoms don't seem to be normal.   I've been having these for about 5-6 weeks now (some nights are worse than others) but generally its been more or less every night.  This has turned into a vicious cycle because when you actually close your eyes at night to go to sleep you are actually waiting for the 'shock' to happen instead of trying to sleep.  Obviously the less sleep you have, the less functional you are the next day and so on and so on.  You then get sleep deprived which I believe also may trigger this.  The only other thing I can add to my symptoms is sometimes during the day I get a spaced out/empty/dizzy/cloudy feeling in the head (hard to explain).  Sometimes this can turn into a sort of brain/head sensation where you feel you need to kind of 'shake it off'.  Again, its hard to explain, something like if you have restless feet and you need to kick out of it but its in the head so you need to give yourself a shake to snap out of it.  I have read quite a bit about anxiety/stress and these symptoms may fall into this category but the issue I have with this, is that I have nothing to be anxious/stressful about!  All is OK with job, money, house, relationship etc so I'm not sure how this all started.  Could I be anxious about this illness?  Again, a vicious cycle?  About me - I'm a fit and healthy 35 year old guy.  I actually exercise quite a lot (go to gym/swim 4 times a week and have run numerous marathons over the past year). Although this fitness regime has stopped since I have started having these symptoms as I am feeling quite weak/tired due to not getting much sleep due to it.  I have no major prior illnesses and I am not on any medication.  I don't want to get in the habit of taking sleep medication.  I have been to the hospital and spent the night where they performed numerous blood tests/Heart ECG/X Rays/Urine and all came back OK.  The only issue I had was slightly high blood pressure (but not high enough to be put on any medication).  I have also been for an MRI scan and EEG epilepsy test.  I will find the results with these in about 5 weeks time.  Anyway, that's my symptoms and hopefully someone might feel at ease that they are going through something similar.   Reading similar posts on the internet I don't think anyone has come to the conclusion on what in fact is causing these problems, even though a lot of the people actually been for tests and seen doctors.  Has anyone experienced these issues?  Thanks guys, feel free to get in touch  
Hi I've just gone back on the amtrypline  after getting off them due to burning pain in my head. I'm bit down cause  on a weekend I like to go out with my friends and have a few beers. I'm only on 10 mg so was wondering if anyone else know whether it's ok to have a few beers while on amtrypline. Waiting your replies thanks  
Sometimes when I try to fall asleep I get a weird sensation being that I can't breathe properly. I have to take a very deep breath to make it go away then I wake up and I wake up at the same time I take the breath. Weirdly I can feel myself not being able to breathe whilst I'm sleeping but my eyes are closed and I can't move even though I'm conscious. It can be quite disstressing as occasionally, when I haven't had the sensations in a long time, I don't know or remember what's happening to me. Thanks. 
Hi everyone,  I am posting this hoping that others who are having similar sleep disorders will maybe want to share their experience. I apologise for what seems to've become a very long thread - I tried to stick to the most relevant details.  For about a year and a half I've been suffering from a specific type of sleep problem. The last part of my sleep, towards the morning (perhaps the final hour or so; hard to tell exactly) is very agitated; feels like a dizziness, as if I had mud in my head, and where I am half-awake (almost conscious/obsessive dream-like thoughts reoccur) yet find it difficult to wake up. This means that, after a struggle to break away from a confusing, exhausting last hour of sleep, not only will I have spent longer in bed than I'd have wished (say, 9 hours) but "in exchange" I get a day during which I am often tired, and sometimes find it hard to stay awake longer than 10pm. "Tricking" myself out of sleep before the critical stage starts (e.g. after 7 hours of sleep) doesn't work, as then I just feel under-slept. Other (even more upsetting) side-effects of this long-standing sleep disorder include irritablility and apathy to exercise and to sex. In addition, I seem to've acquired a form of tinitus (high-pitched buzz in both ears), the severity (loudness) of which varies from day to day, though hard to tell if correlated with sleep quality.  Several medical tests (including ear-nose-throat, endocrinology and head MR-imaging) revealed no obvious cause underlying my symptoms, however a sleep study (polysomnography) revealed two presumtive (tentatively-given) diagnoses: 1) REM sleep disorder (although I don't have the intense dreams characteristic of this diagnostic) 2) borderline sleep apnea (several episodes of irregular breathing per night). After this test, my somnologist prescribed Circadin 2mg (melatonin), which I've been taking for a month now without any noticeable improvements even after being told to double the dosage; the medic recommended, if the Circadin treatment remains ineffective till the end, that I next try to sleep with an anti-apneic mask (CPAP). If that will fail also, she said the only remaining cause remains stress; I haven't been particularly stressed times, however I *do* tend to take things to heart.  Some further details: - Taking natural sleep supplements (camomile tea, pills with lavander, etc) before bedtime helps sometimes but not reliably (probably not beyond placebo) - My sleep is abnormally dependent upon bed-time, in that if I go to bed late (a lot later than, say, midnight) I am guaranteed a tormented sleep. However, even going to bed early (11pm) hardly helps with the final-hour-restlessness that I describe. - I'm keeping careful sleep logs, however none of the factors I suspected - including amount of exercise (which I don't do enough of) and stress during the previous day, bed/pillow conditions, bed time, anything to do with meals (including coffee), etc - don't seem to obviously (and single-handedly) lead to this final-hour-syndrome - Soon after falling asleep, I am told I often fidget/twitch and snore, although I never have trouble *falling* asleep (only at the waking-up end) - Since 1.5 years ago when my problems started, the frequency with which my sleep ends with such a restless hour varies: I've had a few good months/weeks, but otherwise it's rare (maybe one night out of 10) that I *don't* get the symptom, i.e. when I wake up easily and rested. - My sleep hours are normally regular (midnight to 8am)  I am male, mid 30s, no other major health problems. If anyone has encountered similar symptoms and can share any advice of what they tried that worked, I'd be really grateful! Many thanks in advance! 
Hi guys. Very new here.  I really need some advice. It seems I get very anxious at night. And this in turn, prevents me from sleeping.  I'm exhausted. I'll stay wide awake (though tired) for two days, then eventually pass out for a few hours, then back to not sleeping for another two days.  I would firstly like to mention, I'm not a fan of drugs. I barely like taking painkillers let alone sleeping tablets (however I have taken sleeping pills, and because I don't like pills, it made me more anxious and more of a mess, and didn't sleep).  I've been on anti depressants before, really don't want to go back to them, because once again, pills them selves just make me anxious. I do some times take a beta blocker, If my anxiety is too bad. However they don't help me sleep.  If and when I do sleep, A: it doesn't feel like I've slept and if it wasn't for my partner telling me otherwise, I wouldn't of thought I had any sleep. B: I don't dream. I will never have any memory of dreams. C: when I start to drift off asleep, it's like I get a surge of adrenaline. I wake up, almost as soon as I have dropt of to sleep, my heart racing and mind buzzing.  (C, I am sure that's anxiety that is causing that, however it feels like I've had a huge sugar rush).  Every night, I am sweaty and clamy and hot. Once again, I'm sure anxiety.  I struggle to do any exercise during the day to tire my self out, because I'm physically too exhausted to do any thing.  I've tried cutting down on smoking, smoking less at night. Drinking herbal tea and sleepy time tea.  I've cut down my alcohol intake (maybe not enough). I've tried to change as many habits as possible, but nothing is working.   I've had a eeg (or was it Ct)? Can't remember. I've had a brain scan lol, and fine.  I've seen CBT therapists, I've seen psychiatrists. Nothing seems to help.   Is there any thing I could be missing? Is this lack of sleep killing me? I believe I remember reading a study, that lack of sleep can almost half your life span.  Does any one have any advice besides "try and relax", because really, that isn't obvious enough. Specially when you hear those words at least twice a day.  This lack of sleeping is really destroying me. My appetite, my ability to function as a semi decent idiot in this world.  Please some one tell me what to do  
19 Male.  I have this issue that occurs seemingly at random. I suffered from no known mental or sleep related issues. This issue comes and goes seemingly at random. The only thing I can trace it to is when I am having trouble sleeping. I have my eyes closed when this happens, and I am preparing to sleep. However, my mind will still be active, and I will not be close to sleep.   What happens is I see shapes. A square, triangle, and circle. Just those three. Sometimes I see all three, sometimes just two, but I always see at least two.   They are always inside each other, the biggest is on the outside, smaller on the inside, but all the shapes can be the biggest or smallest.  For example, the square could be the biggest, with a smaller but still large triangle inside. Then there is always one incredibly small shape in the middle. Just barely big enough to make out its shape.   Most often the circle is in the smallest, but not always. Sometimes there are all three sizes represented, but only two shapes used.   The biggest can be so big it seems to take up all my vision.    These shapes appear on a completely white background devoid of any other features. They are black, and perfect. In the way that the lines of the square and triangle are all of perfect lengths and perfectly straight. The circle is perfectly round.   These visions come unbidden. I could be thinking about something completely unrelated and they pop into my head. The only way to dismiss them is by opening my eyes. Though closing them could bring them back. I can't return to my original thought. These shapes seem to dominate my mind. Eventually they will leave. These episodes never lasting more than a few minutes. I can't summon them back. I can think of shapes of course, but it is different somehow.   I also experience strange perceptions so to speak. I will be thinking about something and then it will zoom out until I can just barely make out what is there. There will be nothing behind what I am envisioning. Just that same white background.   Say for example that I am thinking about a scene in a movie. All of the sudden it will zoom out until I can just barely see that scene, but there is a huge white background behind it.   Another way to describe would be if you put a projector really close to the surface it was projecting onto. I am talking like 6 inches away.    These visions are uncontrollable to the best of my knowledge. They don't seem to have many triggers except when my sleep patterns become abnormal. The last time I can remember having them regularly was the summer before last.  I had immense trouble sleeping during that time, and they became noticeable then. Though they had happen before they were never so intense.   Recently I've been incredibly tired. I have started going to sleep early at night (9:00-9:30) because I was sleeping for 12 hours plus (still am). As well as many as three naps a day that can last anywhere from 30 minutes to three hours. Anytime I get bored my head starts swimming so to speak. I am not necessarily dizzy, but my head feels incredibly light and wavy.   Any help?  
my psychiatrist seems to think as i have failed on so many ssris that i have a problem with the noradrenaline side, has anyone any knowledge about this 
I have to take highest dose of Lunesta to sleep.  The better I sleep, the better I feel the next day. But if I don't sleep well, which is quite often, I struggle through the day. I think there are are some hereditary issues. Also I have Hashimotos.  But doctors seem to have no idea why I would be up for days without a strong sleeping pill.  I have some social anxiety, and now feel ill in certain social situations. I used to be fine until around 45 years old.  Think this is related to sleep issue. Also developed alchohol intolerance.  But I am struggling through life right now with this insomnia. 
Almost three weeks ago I had a panic attack, ever since then I have pretty much completely lost the abilty to sleep my haed is so numb and almost completely lost all of my memory, I just feel like an empty vesile now, nothing works sleeping tablets, anxiety tablets, you name it Iv'e tried it all, people just tell me it's the anxiety making me think I'm loosing my memory but I just know that I am, I have almost completely lost the ability to imaginate, and I am almost certain if they did an x ray on my brain it would show extensive brain damage, I know most of you probably won't believe me, but I think I will be completely brain dead very soon, just don't know what to do anymore  
Just before I fall asleep into the blissful abyss that is sleep, my  body freezes up,  my eyes go wide, I can't move or make a sound, but most frightening of all, I can't breath! I am wide awake and i know exactly what is happening to me, I see everything that is going on, but there is noting i can do for about three seconds.  Then, as suddenly as happens,  my body jerks and I'm sucking in air again. This happens over and over and over,  every time I'm just about to fall sleep,  until it just doesn't and I'm able to sleep.   My doctor has no explanation,  my insurance will not cover a sleeping test and I'm running out of sanity.  This has been going on for close to five years now.  Five years of maybe getting three to four hours of sleep a night  As a single mother of three,  sleep is precious to me and the only type of vacation I can afford.    Somebody out there has to have an idea of what the hell this is called and a way to make it stop.  Please,  I'm begging for help.. 
my child is 8 and sometimes wakes up shouting runs up and down the stars saying all sorts like mummy 'i dont like it when he explodes out of the wall' or 'mummy i can't' she shouts growls squeezes me all sorts of things but when you speak to her she reponds but doesn't remember what happened the next day. its scary for me and i dont know what it is or what to do. i end up cuddling her and talking to her to calm own untill she falls asleep. 
Posting this on behalf of my friend, trying to find a solution for him. He is lucky if he get a hour a night sleep the rest of the time he is trying to sleep but can't. It's been like this for about 8 months, today he is crashing he said his whole body is tingleing and he nearly passed out and I'm worried what to do. His sleeping pills don't work anymore and he has tried everything, this will kill him eventually what can we do. ?  
Hi,  I've been suffering from a bunch of degenerative symptoms since Apr 2015.  Initially, it was just a sense of constant floatiness and dizziness.  Then in Mar 2016, I started experiencing mild tingles on my face and arms.  In Jul 2016, constant tremors on both hands and cheeks started showing, along with random muscle twitches all over the body.  In late Dec 2016, I started experiencing a constant need to urinate (average once an hour).  3 weeks back, my knees started to feel really weak and cramp/tight. Discomfort when walking.  I've seen a bunch of doctors (ENT, cardiologist, sleep clinic, neck/spine, 2 diff neuros) and done a bunch of tests (blood, thyroid, MRI brain, MRI neck, 24hr ECG, sleep tests, nerve conduction).  Only the sleep study showed a finding of mild OSA (10.9). My neuro thinks my symptoms are caused by sleep apnea but I'm not sure I convinced.  Can sleep apnea really cause the kind of symptoms I'm experiencing? 
I have been having chronic sleep problems for many years and have found that 5 or 10mg of Zolpidem have helped.  However, recently I have been taking them more often and am trying alternatives, so far with little on-going success: Amitriptiline only worked for 2 nights then couldn't sleep, then Phenergan.  Now trying Circadin but I always have problems getting to sleep, let alone waking at 4am when I do take some medication.  What do people think about Circadin (Melatonin) 2mg and has anyone had success with Zolpidem over a long period (6-7 weeks at a time?) 
A friend just had a sleeping paralysis, I know is normal to feel a presence while it but the thing is that she didn't wake up when she got to move her arm, neither when she started to scream, is that normal? I hope I made my self clear, I don't speak a perfect english  
Hi I am new to this discussion just after Christmas I went to bed as normal and as soon as my head hit the pillow I was wide awake and clock watched all night and I have been like this since, I just can't fall asleep my mind is clear I'm relaxed but I just toss and turn look at the ceiling all night, I went to the doctors after a week of no sleep and explained I was finding it hard to function now so he prescribed Zopiclone 7.5mg to be taken every 3rd night for about 3wks and it would kick my system back into zinc but I found the day after I took it I felt worse and then the two nights without it I was wide awake again and spent all night just staring into space so after 3 was of that I was no better off at all yes the tablet knocked me out for 8 hrs the night I took it but I felt worse for it. So fast forward another 6wks on to now I'm still no better I have tried all the normal stuff watt milky drink, warm bath, going for walks, not going to bed until I feel tired, reading, watching tv, listening to soothing music. This is now 10 weeks in total I have had no more than 20mins a night since Christmas I look like death warmed up and losing weight rapidly because I have completely lost any kind of appetite it's now ruling me my life I can't function I just keep bursting into tears and my moods are so up and down. I can't even sit in the chair and doze I'm just awake. I'm shocked that I am still standing to be honest but I can see I will just burn out soon as it's getting harder to focus and my memory is awful. Got a new doctor she is anti sleeping tablets and gave me lots of fact sheets about relaxing and good sleep methods which haven't worked and wants to see me in 4 weeks I really don't know if I can survive another 4 weeks with no sleep. Any advice would be appreciated as I do feel I'm slowly losing the plot  Thank you Karen 
I've been suffering from Sleep paralysis quite a lot lately it freaks me out, as it feels like I'm about to die, first i'll hear a wooshing sound in my ears then my body feels paralysed and I feel like I can't breath I'm obviously sleeping but I can hear myself calling out for my partner to help me,although I'm whispering it because I can't find my voice. It frightens me and I force myself to wake up. I don't know how I do it but I do. Then I can't sleep for hours for fear it will come back. Has anyone suffered like this and why is this happening to me?  Rachel. 
He's new in post. Had appointment it seems he is flailing around, asking me if i have had different meds, which I have, then he starts asking about things like clomipramine, abilify, lithium, he doesnt seem sure where to go.  Left not having any strategy, he will get back to me.  Meantime I am so depressed I need something. Should I just agree to clomipramine to get going? Anyone on this 
I've been experiencing a reoccurring nightmare on a nighty basis. I often wake up extremely distressed and confused and struggle to tell what is real and what is not. It started a while ago but it has been progressively getting more realistic and more frequent. I suffer from anxiety and depression which I have read is ofter connected and I am on antidepressants. In the nightmare I am fully aware of the fact I am dreaming and am unsuccessfully trying to wake up, I am also dreaming that I am dreaming and trying to wake up, sometimes I do wake up in my dream but then it just repeats. I am normally just dreaming of everyday things such as walking my dog or something simple like that but there is a lack of control and I'll often end up in an uncomfortable situation and be confused as to whether or not it really happened when I wake up. The nightmares are disturbing my sleep quite severely so I really need to find some way to stop or atleast control them so I was wondering how to do this? 
I've been a "night owl" most of my life, but about 2 years ago I began having real problems falling asleep at night. Around the same time, I began experience odd symptoms - the constant smell of something like burning plastic, loss of peripheral vision, seeing spots. A CT scan of my brain showed nothing untoward occurring, and the symptoms subsequently resolved.  I ordinarily can't fall asleep until 2 or 3am, and often forgo sleeping because I'm afraid I won't wake in time to make it to work at 6am. I try to get to bed early (around 8pm), because I know it will take hours to fall asleep. This leads to periods of hypersomnia where my life just basically gets put on hold while my body recovers from the physical exhaustion. During these periods, I usually experience very vivid (and often lucid) dreams.  Of course, I've seen my PC and MH professionals about it. I've tried a number of things to solve the problem. I've removed all digital screens from my bedroom, I've tried mindfullness and guided meditation programs, establishing routines, psychotherapy, sleeping pills and melatonin, even alcohol. The sleeping pills work, but I often don't take them because it gets too late. And, similarly to the alcohol, I don't want to become dependent on a substance. I've also cut down on caffiene consumption. I avoid coffee/tea unless I don't have any plans the next morning.  The latest thing I've tried is reading. It's been marginally successful, but has lead me to my current ludicrous theory. So, I wanted to put this out there to see if anyone could tell me whether or not the idea has any merit.  I happened upon an article on the pineal gland while stuck in a rabbit hole on another website, which got me interested in how some kind of disorder with my pineal gland could potentially be causing, or at least contributing to my sleep problems. I am wondering if, due to the pineal gland's role in producing melatonin and regulating the circadian ryhthm, as well as it's possible role in creating DMT (which could effect dreams during R.E.M. sleep), there could be something wrong with mine? Perhaps a benign tumor or cyst or something? I realize this is probably not something most doctors would look for, and I don't know if it would show up on a CT scan vs. MRI or x-ray. I'm just trying to find the problem so I work work on the solution.  I welcome any input anyone might have on this issue. Cheers!     
I have occationally problem sleeping. Those bad days, thoughts (stupit and crazy thoughts) drive me to not be able to sleep. The only way i have to sleep is to take sleep pills. I want slowly to stop taking pills because they are bad for u.  Does anyone out there knows any free source of guided meditation. I want to put a pause on these thoughts with meditation. I can not use Tv or Music because i get focused on it and i do not sleep.  Thanks in advance 
 I've been dealing with insonmia for a while now and its had its ups and downs, as well as rebounds that happen frequently. So im currently going through a rebound after a worrying i might not sleep, I'm currently constantly waking up or i jolt awake right at the moment im about to fall asleep which is odd since i was sleeping perfectly fine for the last few months. I had moments like this before but im unsure how i overcame it. does anybody have any suggestions? Note that mind relaxations dosent do much for me and what works are usually medicine or depriving my sleep for weeks until i pass out bascially but i cant do that currently in my life. Also does anybody have any preventious measures for rebounds to happen less? 
My mom babysits my neice a few times a week so im used to hearing sounds early morning from the baby whether its crying or just making random gibberish sounds. However this morning I feel like I woke up from a deep sleep hearing the baby making noises and my mom talking to the baby however it sounded a little off and like it was coming from far away. I feel like I was certainly awake however but when I did fully wake up 30 minutes later my mom told me she was not watching the baby today which shocked me for a second because I was sure I heard baby sounds. Is it possible to think I heard these things when I was really asleep because it really felt like I was awake in my bed hearing baby sounds. 
It's been nine days now since I started having terrible insomnia. I feel my life has been ripped out from under me and I don't know where to turn. It started with one bad nights sleep nearly two weeks ago and now I'm not sleeping for one second during the night. The doctor has prescribed me citalopram for the horrible anxiety I'm experiencing all night. I also have sleeping tablets and Diazepam in the cupboard but I really don't want to take them. My big fear is ill never sleep again. Every one keeps telling me that I'll eventually fall asleep but after another night of absolutely no sleep I've convinced myself that something has happened to me and I WILL never sleep again. I've never used a forum before but I guess I'm kindling kind of reaching out to anyone who has had a similar problem or thought pattern. I have very thing going for me in life with great kids and a good job but it all seems over now as I'm convinced my total lack of sleep will ruin everything.  Is it possible to never sleep again? Someone please help! 
hi,  for the past two weeks i been suffering from sleeping problems  i don't get the dozing off feeling anymore and if i do sleep at night it feels extremely light. i also remember every dream i have and wake up 1-2 hours.  i'm not sure is this is due to stress or anxiety but before this i dealt with almost 2 months of a viral infection with a sore throat that wouldn't go away and they ran all tests they could do and told me to just let it ran it's course and now i'm sufferring with insomnia when i should be sleeping to make my immune system stronger after this virus.  my question is can anxiety or stress cause this type of sleeping problem has anyone suffered from this ????  i'm starting to grow scare pls help 
The last 5 months have been stressful   From a 7 year relationship breakup. To having a viral infection that was confused for a bacterial infection and was given and overload of antibiotics. Nothing helped until I went natural to try to fight some virus that has to this day left me with swollen tonsil  The problem now is that I'm the beginning of January two nights of not sleeping well has spiral into a mess.    From hearing it could be insomnia due to a reaction to antibiotics , or from supposedly glandular fever, swollen tonsils , or it could be due to anxiety/stress   I feel like I'm living in hell with no way out of this :,(  I'm thinking my sleeping problem has to do with high levels of anxiety since melatonin,trazadone ,Benadryl didn't work to help me sleep in January . The only thing that has helped me was Ativan or xanax .   I try not taking those drugs daily Ativan gives me 4-5hrs of straight sleep but after it's the light sleep  When I don't take them my sleep is so light and I'm a half/wake state . I wake up ever 1hr or maybe less and always off a vivid dream or don't even feel like I've been sleeping .  I don't seem to reach deep sleep in December I was sleeping fine my normal 7-9 hrs    Has anyone slept this way ??? I fear this will never go away but even then I try to tell myself things will get better .   Any advise would be appreciated .   Can this really be anxiety or something else ???  Please help  
Hi all Any advice grateful received.   For various reasons, i've had a week of awful sleep. I've just come off mirtazapine, dealing with the side effects of a increase in thyroxine and have recently started a stressful new job. Anxiety about getting enough sleep has been something i've had since i was a child, and it resurfaces whenever i've had a few bad nights and that in itself is anither major brrier to dosing off.   i've tried all the tricks i know of, cbt techniques, writing things down, reading, getting up, rescue remedy, exercise and talking to my husband. But every night i get into bed and i am gripped by panic and end up taking a sleeping pill. even they aren't working well and i only sleep for 3 or 4 hours.   I feel the key in my mind, i need to think about sleep differently, my fear is almost phobic and childlike. I have a young family and work and struggle to get by with very little sleep.   Can anyone recommend anything to help?   grateful for any suggestions   thanks rachel  
It's 6 am as I type this. I have been trying to sleep since midnight. over the past 8 months my sleep has gradually declined, due to a strange disease, to literally nothing. tonight, my brain has decided to shut off completely. I'm no longer even drifting in and out of REM sleep, which for the past 2 weeks was all I was getting.  I started suffering brain  shocks/stomach flutters upon drifting off a while back, which led to my sleeplessness. pills worked for a while, but lost their effectiveness. I suffer from dysautonomia as a result, with my pulse rate and blood pressure skyrocketing since i've had this problem. I literally cannot think of what I was going to type next. I am so afraid. this problem is not transient-- my brain and nervous system have gone haywire, and I fear there's no going back. 
I am a 35 year old male at 5'11" at 220lbs.  Recently when I wake up to use the rest room in the middle of the night I will find my self dizzy and with a ache in the center of my chest where the I feel it is the stomach meets the esophagus. I do get a tingle in my left arm as well.  I do not feel pressure through out my chest nor does my heat rate increase significantly.  I feel burping release some of the achy tention and helps stop the dizzy spell.  I do drink some water to help with burping on occasion.  This will also occur in the morning if I eat a cereal with lots of fiber.  It seems to go away after a bit and then I feel great.  Water seems to help sometimes and hinder in other times.    I will also mention I have changed my diet recently.  I have been eating more fiber then usually and drinking only water as a beverage or Cranberry Appley Healthy Balance Juice.  I have cut off caffinee such as Mountain Dew and eating more vegatables such as brocoli, carrots and tomatoes.    Other details:  I have had gastrisis reflux in the past on a few occassions.  But I never experienced dizzynees.  I have not been eating anything past 5pm in the last few days to see if it was a caused by what I eat late at night.  My resting heart rate is between 72-80 and when this happens my heart rate stays roughly normal with no really increase.  I have been stressing out lately over some issues (and that when my reflux seems to come back)  I assume it is my change in diet and my stressing causing my reflux to come back but curious why only at night.  Any information would be most beneficial. 
I'm a frequent insomniac. I spend a lot of time on the edge of sleep, but it never really comes unless there's a little (or a lot) of wine on board. I can go with only a few hours of sleep for days. For years, there were occasions when I'd hear various loud slams and bangs while trying to sleep, but never any source. I've looked that up, and I know it's a thing (hypnogaga). Lately though, there have been what sounds like shouts in my ear that form very clear, and sometimes freaky, sentences. Last night I was laying there in the dark when out of the blue, I distinctly heard, "TURN OFF THE LIGHTS!!" I jumped up and shrieked even. About a half hour later, it was, "GET OUT OF HERE!!!" I understand it's probably part of the disorder, but man! So scary! Does anyone else ever experience this to this level of severity? 
Insomniac forHave been taking Zopiclone for 15 years. At a point where I Could use some support from 'like' insomnia she. Is this what this is for? 
I used to have sleep paralysis every month or so, this year its gotten to every week, then every few days and now i'm having it over 4 times a night. It is literally impossible for me to sleep at night and I am only able to fall sleep at stupid times like 9 the following morning.   I am genuinely scared and definitely need to see a doctor but I can't do that until Monday, I am scared my brain is actually damaged. I get a rushing noise like wind in my ears when I close my eyes and pressure and loud noises. It's horrible, I can't deal with it anymore.  I need some advice, is it my diet, my sleep pattern or what? Please anything would help until I can get to a doctor on Monday, thanks.  
Does anybody struggle to sleep on venlafaxine? ? I am at my wit's end, I physically can not sleep at night. I go up to bed around 9pm watch my husband fall fast asleep then I get up around 11 as I can't lay there much longer with my mind racing. I then come down stairs until around 4,5am I will then eventually drop off but then can't wake in the morning and end up sleeping in until 1 in the afternoon. I don't think I can take much more of it. My days have become nights and my nights my days,feel so low.� 
Okay my friend had this weird thing every night for a few years when she was 4-8 years old (she's 15 now.) She is very concerned about it right now and I want to help her.  Well here goes the story  Every night when she went to sleep she saw this tornado in the middle of her room, Small dark coloured shapes fell on her arms and waist, she just brushed them off with her hands. She couldn't fell them, she could only see them. They were not scary but irritating. This was there every night until the bed got moved to the other side of the room.  Anyone know what this is or what could have caused it?  She has no fear of tornadoes. 
Hi all,  My partner and I are having issues sleeping in the same bed together, and i'm wondering if anyone has any advice please?  We've been together for over a year, and he stays at mine on average 1/2 times a week. He has no major issues sleeping at home on his own, and I have no problems sleeping when he isn't around. However when he stays at mine, he barely sleeps. He falls asleep without issue, but then wakes up and spends most of the night awake. And i have the same problem (although probably sleep slightly more than he does).  He's allergic to my cat, so she's no longer allowed in the bedroom. I've also recently changed my mattress as my old one was too soft, but neither of these solutions have helped him sleep. I'm not sure if this is just a case of not getting used to sleeping together, or something more. In a long term relationship in the past, I recall sleeping very badly for years until we moved in together, and eventually I got used to it.  Can anyone offer any advice please?  I've recently asked him to move in with me, but i'm afraid when he does that neither of us will get any sleep!  Thanks, Sarah 
I don't know how to describe how and what I feel. It's sort of weakness and fatigue. It's not real tiredness. I wish it was cause then I could drink coffee, some physical activity or something. But no matter what I do it's always there. I know it's related to my sleep but the thing is I am falling asleep. Waking up in the middle of the night and falls asleep again just to wake up to an awful feeling and to not being myself the entire day. I suffered from sleep problems for the last 2 years. Mostly insomnia, waking up after 4 hours and not being able to fall asleep again. But that one is worse. I also have the urge to stretch my legs so I thought maybe it's Restless legs syndrome but I'm not sure. I live now in Belgium and the doctors here are very not open minded so I know it's a waste of time going. Especially when I don't know how to explain myself. I just had a newborn baby 6 days ago and instead of being pumped for real I'm mainly pretending I am and actually dying inside.  So my symptoms are: Weakness all over  Light-headedness  Urge to move my limbs   Hope someone can relate 
Has anyone had experience with zopiclone withdrawal?  
I am looking for some advice, I am having trouble sleeping. My neighbour has their loud at night, we tried talking to her but she still does it. Even when there is no noise, I am still struggling to get to sleep. For the noise I thought about getting ear plugs, I can't put the foam ones in my ear and don't like the ones when you have to mould them. Could any recommend a good pair of ear plugs with a high decibel? Also I heard about sound deafening headphones? Can you use them for sleeping? Are there any tablets that you can buy to make you feel tired? Sorry for all the questions any help will be greatly appreciated. 
Hey all. So as a child, I would not fall asleep unless I had some sort of light and sound going on (i.e. the tv). This all stems from some deeply routed anxieties revolving around dark places and silence that I have since gotten better with, but not fully over. I just remember so many nights just staying up, tossing and turning, closing my eyes and hoping to sleep with no avail. That was elementary school, but has been present in my life all throughout middle school, high school, and now, college. Is it possible to have insomnia at such a young age? And if I don't start receiving treatment soon, I'm worried that my health will further decline and I won't be able to keep myself sane. I've just had an appointment with a counselor, but I want to know what would be the next step to take from here.  Side note: I've tried virtually everything to help me sleep that isn't a prescription. Melotonin, valerian root, lavender, counting down from 100, breathing exercises, meditation, soothing piano music, exercising at night to wear me out, etc. If you can name it, I've probably tried it and it never worked for me.  
Hi I've had  what feel like a burning brain it's there most of the time. Some days worse than others.I've come off medication as was not heiping  .had mri ct scan all clear. Anyone else suffer from this.  
Hi everyone!  I'm 18 and for about 2 years now (or so) I just can't stop feeling tired all the time. I sleep from about 10pm to at least 7am every night (and still wake up feeling exhausted) and most days I'll need at least 1 hour nap to get through the day. I've tried changing my diet and exercise and all that but nothing seems to work. When discussing with my Dr, she just orders more blood tests or tells me it's part of being a 'teenager'- but it's been going on so long now and no one I know needs anywhere near as much sleep as me. Has everyone had a similar thing or have any tips to help me try and get out of this horrible cycle? 
Hi. I briefly searched the forums for my question but couldn't find anything, so here goes:  I don't always get enough sleep at night. Not because I can't sleep but because i tend to go late to bed. This results in me being in need of a nap when I get home from school in the afternoon. I turn on my alarm clock the same way I do at night and it almost always wakes me up in the morning, rady to go to school. The problem is: Sometimes it don't.   As recently as today I snap out of a bubble when my mother is yelling at me for not getting up and starting making dinner. I look at the clock and it's an hour past the time I was supposed to get up. My mother was yelling at me because I apparently had told her many times that I would get up but never did. All I remember though, is setting the alarm and waking up to an angry mother.  I wanted to know if anybody else has experienced unconsciously turning off their alarm and having conversations and ending up sleeping for way too long and if so; what to do about it, besides getting a really loud alarm.  Thanks  
For the past year, I have periodically had multiple episodes of stopping breathing as I am about to fall asleep. In essence, as I am about to "cross over" from an awake state to sleep, I suddenly stop breathing, and have to breathe in deeply, which wakes me up. It keep recurring, and can take me hours and hours to fall asleep - it is torture. I have had a number of tests. I don't have heart failure, my lung function is normal (although I am asthmatic, and have incident of breathlessness during the day), and I don't suffer from anxiety. Any ideas? 
My partner requested me to change our old mattress, because it's very uncomfortable and it makes sleep problems to her. Is a mattres guarantee better sleep?  
 I'm 25, I eat any type of food, I'm not overweight nor fat. I don't have hypothyroidism nor diabetes. I'm a girl. I'm not stessed. Sleep apnea started when I was 17, I suffered from major depression back then it started at about 14. I thought it was related to stress but now I haven't been stressed in a long time. I also have had mind issues since depression went away. A year or tow after depression stopped I started having hypothyroidsm symptoms then I found out at 24 I had hashimoto's but I've been taking pills for 5 months and sleep apnea is still there and it seems as if it's getting worse and worse. I swear to God I'm not depressed. I have difficulty concentrating and just in general my mind is really way worse that it used to be. 
I have a number of issues when I sleep, but no google search ever brings me any answers to what I experience or why. I am almost always very tired when I wake up in the morning, and almost always remember parts of the MANY dreams I have had. I often 'wake up' (not entirely awake, though...) many times in the middle of the night and am half aware that I am laying in my bed while I am dreaming. I always try to convince myself I can stop participating in my dream because I am at home and it is the middle of the night, but it either doesn't work or it takes a good while for me to wake up enough to stop dreaming and fall back asleep.   I have in the past realized that I act out my dreams occasionally. I am unaware if I do this a lot, but I have woken up to, say, practicing instruments, 'cleaning my room', posing for pictures, etc. These are all done in my bed, and only the upper half of my body ever acts the dreams out. My legs have never participated. The movements are what eventually wakes me up from those dreams and I have to convince myself that I'm at home and can stop dreaming. All of my dreams where I act them out or half wake-up and try to convince myself to stop are usually me performing some type of responsibility I have during my normal day or an upcoming responsibility.   I just started using a Fitbit, and I know they are not reliable but say that I am awake or restless up to 35 times during a given night. I have considered buying a more reliable device used specifically for sleep tracking.   To be clear, I have never Lucid dreamed. I have never been in control of my dreams, and only struggle to convince myself to wake up enough to stop the dream once I am half awake already. I would just like to get an idea on ways to sleep soundly and stop these dreams that seem to dominate all of my nights. They are usually never nightmares, just normal dreams, but I am exhausted in the morning nonetheless.  I appreciate any insight or comments and thank you for taking the time.  
Last night I had a very bad nightmare. And the nightmare has followed me since my childhood. It starts by feeling small and the world is so bigger than me then I feel like I'm getting bolder : my hand is so big then I throw something that gets bigger and bigger until I feel like it's ok and I don't see it anymore then the world turns upside down like the gravity is changed  and something is going to crush me thenmy heart starts beating and I start to run then I wake up and can't sleep for 2h. Why is that happening and it's really disturbing. (this happens when I'm sick) 
I can't sleep at all without sleeping pill. Chronic headaches all day long. Also chest discomfort, pressure, and tightness intermittently. What could be causing this? Ive lost a year of my life to this, suffering almost daily. Really tough for me and family. Please help. -Adam 
My husband works nights so no eating late and avoid drinks before bed is out of the question for him. He has adhd which means he cant just lay down and reliex to fall asleep  He refuses to read books and won't turn off the tv, phone, or laptop. The only time I can get him to use a sleep aid pill is when he has to has to be up before noon. I also don't want him to be dependent on the pills either. He refuses to put something boring and quite on the TV to help sleep  He refuses to drink the sleepy time teas the right way. He waits until it is cold, downs it, and than drinks a soda shorty after because his thirsty. Due to not having a set work time every night there is no hope what so ever to have a set time to sleep every day. And there is no way to wind him down early because he complains about being stressed from work and just wanting to relax and game for a bit. I understand and respect this he deserves time to relax and have fun after being treated like crap all night.  So what can I do to help him sleep early? right now he ends up passing out at around 8am and waking up around 3pm and than complains because he has no time to relax before having to go to work. We ended up not getting anything to eat today because of it. 
I know he can't help it but my partner snores nearly every night and as I already find getting to sleep difficult, it is causing me to sleep in another bedroom or use painful earplugs made of wax. (not good for relationship!!) :cry:   His GP has tole him to lose weight and nothing else, we have tried a spray used down the throat, but this makes it worse.  I am not working and he is, so his sleep is more important than mine at the moment, however I get really irritable (especially when he denies snoring and even says he has trouble getting to sleep when I can hear him snoring as soon as his head touches the pillow!!!!)  Anyone got any good ideas?  He is trying to lose weight and we go to the gym regularly. He doesn't ever blow his nose - only sniffs all the while, which must be causing some obstruction.  He is constantly picking at dry skin in his nasal passage - must all be linked? 
is anyone taking Remeron as an add on to an SSRI for insomnia?  What dosage?  I'm on Citalopram 40 mg. 
About 7 months ago I started to have sleeping issues, doctors gave me Mitrazapine which only worked for a few days then added to the problems. Quit them after a night in A and E where I was told everything was normal.   6 months on taking no tablets my syptoms are:   Insomnia - went 5 days without ANY sleep recently, until the doctors gave me Temazepam 10 mg (which to me are too weak and only gave me a few)   Currently on 3 days no sleep, not tired at all.   Feel WIRED - too much energy, don't feel tired even after not sleeping for days (so much so i thought i was bi polar which has been ruled out 3 times).... thinking this might be Addrenaline I am feeling or something?  Sweating much more than normal   Anxiety  Headaches   Dilated Pupils   Feel physically sick and look it sometimes  Blank Mind (Probably from all the anxiety)   Worst of all.... HUGE penis shrinkage, not taking an inch or too, i am talking it's shrivelled no morning wood, ED etc, which makes me believe something hormonal.   I've been tested for prolactin and thyroid both come within range although were a bit high at some points. Totally cluless and so are the doctors, what should i demand tests for? anyone had similar experiences?  
I fall asleep all of the time and sleep for several days at a time.  I.  Loose track of time and don't know what day it is.  When I'm not sleeping I can barely function because I'm so tired.  I've been medicated for this problem for over fifteen years now but it is no longer doing any good.  These sleeps that take me over are like           going into a coma.  I can't wake from them.  HELP!! 
Hi, I've been suffering severe insomnia for about 3 months. Have been following a sleep restriction programme on the advice of a CBT therapist, but not very rigorously until this past week. I'm having 2 problems with it. Firstly,  every other night I only sleep between zero and 2 hours, but I've been recommended not to have a sleep 'window' of less than 4.5 hours, which is way more than my weekly average amount of sleep. Secondly, when I get up because I can't sleep, I never feel sleepy. In fact, I have hardly felt sleepy for 3 months despite appalling sleep. I feel exhausted, but never sleepy. So during the night I'm always getting back into bed as alert as when I got out of it. If I stayed out of bed until I felt sleepy I'd have to stay awake all night.   Any advice? Thanks!  
I feel that I need to get 7 hours of sleep so that I don't feel sleepy upon waking up the next day. What is more appropriate strategy to take if I am not able to sleep 7 hours for some reason? Strategy1: Wake up at the usual time even if that would make me sleepy the whole day? Strategy2: I should let my body sleep 7 hours and then wake disregarding the time of the day at which I usually wake up?  Note: If I take the former approach, I have to take 400mg of caffeine and sometimes more to keep me awake at work. Also, taking a nap during the day is not possible for me.  Please advice. 
So basically I have a mild case of asthma and I'm to scared to use chemicals of any type to help out.I also have a fear of suffocating in my sleep due to my nighttime asthma I will lay down and wake up just as I nod out in a huge panic because it feels like I stopped breathing. I will usually go a couple days without sleep b4 my body can't take it and I sleep from being too fatigued.is their any way to get over this fear any way of naturally putting my brain to sleep without meds? 
I am a 41 years old man that always had a good "relationship" with sleep (except few occations). My first insitend happened 10 years ago when i was working in a company and my supervisor gave me super stress. At night i was tossing and turning sometimes until the morning, other times until the early morning hours and then i would sleept. The next day i was Very cranky. Then i was hire in a more relaxed position and sleep became my buddy again. ( of course i never had sleep shedule). I might go for a visit to a friends house and i felt a bit sleepy i would take a nap. No problem. Sometimes i would sleep for some hours before sleep and then went to sleep again with no problem.  Then i was laid off from that company and was hired to a new one (after some months). And after 1.5 i was laid off from the second company too. And ended up being unemployed for almost 3 years. (i was sleeping without any problems)  Then one day i had a call from my former employer and i was hired.  And then this nightmare started. The first day at work i went without sleep at night. Stomach cramps, heard going crazy and thoughts not being able to make them shut up. At the begining the job was very stressfull (along with other things in my life. But these things are dealed with) This went for a few months struggling. Then i decided to go to a psychologist to help me deal with my night fear of sleeping. At the beginging she tried to help (i manage to somehow ease to some extent the "side effects" but the sleepiness continued. Every week almost i had 2 insomnia nights and one of colapsed sleep. And this went for half year almost. (from the begining). Then i begged her to redirect me to a pshychiatrist to give me some medicine. Which it did. I started with light medication. Which for short periot of time it worked and then again no sleep. Now i am taking 2*10mg Stilnox+2*6mg lexotanil. Thank god these night have been reduced to 1 or 2 per week. the others i just sleep normally.  Now what i want is for me to get ride of these pills because THEY are BAD for your health.  I am still continueing the therapy also for those 1 or 2  days. (because i do have some days that i get to the panic state like before)  Does anyone know any more "Natural" way to fight this problem (i mean not medications) 
I often wake up from my sleep in night with difficulty breating/swallowing like shortness of breat. Dont have sleep apnoea as have done tests for this.  Often sometimes, I wake up before my body does which is scary... my mind is alert but my body not moving 
Hi, new here, and desparate. I'm a single Mum, been suffering insomnia on and off for about 20 years but 3 months ago I stopped sleeping well and gradually have stopped sleeping altogether. I can go 4 or 5 nights with no sleep at all, then I reach for the zopiclone. If I take them more often they don't work. I'm on mirtazapine for anxiety but they haven't made any difference to my sleep. Nothing over the counter has any effect at all. I have great sleep hygiene, eat healthily and don't drink caffeine. I take regular exercise. I gave up work for 2 months. I have to go back now because I need the money, but I realistially I don't see how it's going to be possible. I am at the very end of my ability to cope. Please help.  
As soon as I close my eyes I feel as if something is getting closer and closer even though nothing is here plus i start to flex my muscles and panic. It got to the point where I only fall asleep when my body cannot physically stay awoken. I'm claustrophobic and afraid of dark, but I have a decent sized white room and I sleep with lights. Also when I'm alone I shiver and run around the house as fast as I can not looking behind because I fear seeing some kind of monster... When will this stop? What do I do? I don't be line in monsters and stuff like that plus I'm 20 years old and cannot take it anymore... Also it's impossible to wake me up with sound- I need to be touched firmly. Please help. 
 This is my first post so I'll start by saying hello and thanks in advance for any responses.  I just stumbled across this forum in the wee hours of the morning and it has been comforting to read through many threads and see that I'm not alone in the insomnia struggle.    I'll try to spare most of the details about my history, though I believe some background is necessary in order to give good advice.  Like many here, I began losing sleep about 5 years ago due to work related stress and anxiety.  After about 3 months of 1-2 hours a night, I started having memory and concentration problems.  Predictably, I saw a doctor, then a sleep specialist, and was prescribed all grades of anti-anxiety and sleep medicines.  None of these pills worked for my symptoms but I did develop a slight dependence to Xanax, which I needed on a nightly basis to even get the 2 hours of sleep I was getting before taking the meds.  I kicked all medications a few months ago, along with alcohol, as all of these things seemed to only make me feel worse during the day and had no positive effect on my insomnia.  I left the job eventually, but as you might have guessed, the sleep problems stayed around as did the chronic stress (but the stress levels are better).  I have experienced all same lows that everyone else here has, from the memory problems to the worry about the long-term neurological effects, to the depression.   I have been through the thing where I believe my problem is unique, or that I'm going to die, or be severely demented by the time I'm 40.  Luckily, the logical thinking ability I have left reasoned me out of these ideas. I believe I can kick this mess and get back to some degree of normal sleep.   I am working on relaxing more during the day and have noticed some improvements in stress levels the last month.  For the past week, I have been attempting sleep restriction/hygeine to help reset my sleep system.  My main questions to the forum are regarding sleep reistriction:  Has anyone had success with SRT? What are your experiences? How have you managed to stay awake until your designated sleep time?  I am supposed to stay awake until 12:30A and am having some difficulty doing so, odd as it seems for an insomniac.  My problem is staying asleep, not falling asleep at night and I often crash as 9PM only to wake up at 10:30 or 11:00 and either not fall back asleep or experience a choppy, interrupted sleep where I seem to wake up every couple of minutes.   Any advice is appreciated.   
Desperate for sleep, haven`t slept for 9months.Can`t stop violently shaking all the time. Tinitus. This has led to severe anxiety & depression. 
I cannot sleep.... the moment I attempt to fall asleep it's almost as though a something gets released and I start feeling Tremors inside my head these tremors are very annoying very strong they stay with me I can barely fall asleep and then when I do it's very lucid dreaming at the most I wake up within 45 minutes to an hour and the tremors are still there. I also have very intense jerks when I try to fall asleep with the tremors nothing seems to stop the tremors. During the day my brain feels like it's not working correctly at all  feels very Spacey surreal....just to give you a background on what's been going on with me I am 46 years old I had a full hysterectomy 6 weeks ago within days of my hysterectomy I started getting severe headaches  I was concerned after 5 days  of having these headaches I called my doctor and they got back with me and said they forgot to tell me about my hormone patch that was sitting at a pharmacy that I don't even go to so I got on Miniville estrogen after several days in the meantime my vision was also blurry and I started feeling very surreal foggy and unusual brain tingling pains electrical zaps and a type of mental decline. Honestly it felt like I was coming down with Dementia or something. I felt like every single day my brain was either under attack with an infection or I was losing some of my cognitive abilities. I also started having trouble sleeping shortly after this.... having trouble falling asleep waking up  with tremors in my head  couple weeks ago and then last week I had a stressful week and started getting the Tremors before I fell asleep not just after I woke up I did not sleep for 4 days solid. Went to the ER because everyone was closed for Christmas they sent me home with Ambien... tried that and it did not work already tried Benadryl it did not work tried melatonin it did not work try breathing exercises it did not work. At best right now I am getting maybe an hour asleep at night usually about 45 minutes. Like I said the brain Tremors are inside my head and to be clear my head does not Shake itself just inside and I'm getting lots of jerks muscle spasms with my body that wake me up immediately...then wake up and my blood pressure goes through the roof my normal blood pressure is 110 over 60 lately my blood pressure after I wake up is 170/100. I cannot figure this out I have tried different hormones over the last couple weeks nothing is working I don't even know if it's hormone-related. I went to the doctor he ordered an MRI gave me lorazepam that's not working either  but it does make the Tremors feel softer. I am very concerned lately I am actually scared to even fall asleep because of the nightmares and jerks that immediately ensuing wake me up. Just wanting to know if anyone has ever gone through anything like this very scary thank you for anyone's time or advice it is appreciated. 
Every night and in the day sometimes, I wheeze and at night I breathe very loudly and snore. My GP. Said I'm too old to start with asthma now, I'm ,63.  Sometimes I get an inhaler when I ask for one sometimes I don't.  I had a letter asking me to fill in a peak flow meter chart and see nurse in two weeks.  I had never had a peak flow meter or seen a nurse.  I feel really unwell and front know what to do.   
I've been having some strange sleep problems since about June which have just been getting worse.   I feel like I have zero control over my sleep pattern. I try to fall asleep everywhere. Lectures, buses, cars, I've even slept in restaurants. I'm asleep instantly and I feel as though there's no passing of time. So I usually wake up confused. I may wake up often but I can't stay awake for long. For example in the morning's I keep asking up but falling asleep again almost straight away. This is the worst when I'm on the bus. No matter how much I try to stay awake, I keep falling asleep. I never know where I am.   I know when I'm gonna fall asleep. It always starts with my vision blurring and not being able to think straight. I don't hallucinate but my thoughts become completely random, kind of like how dreams have no logical order. Whatever I'm doing at the time I'll continue doing it. Say for example I'm speaking, I'll start saying random words or talking about things that are completely irrelevant. Yesterday mid conversation I said that I was soup. I forget a lot of the things I do when I'm like this. It's terrifying when people tell me that I've done something or said something that I have zero recollection of.  I can't do anything for any sustained period of time without falling asleep. I'm a university student so I have time of work to do. The best solution I've found is to work in public and take a 15 min to half an hour nap every 45 mins. It's not exactly ideal, the simplest tasks take me forever.   I have exams coming up and I struggle to even read for long so I really need to find some kind of solution or at least have an idea of what's wrong with me.  No one takes me seriously and the hospital I'm currently attending to get a diagnosis is taking their sweet time.   What could I do to speed things up a bit? Is there anyone experiencing something similar?  
Hello, I'm hoping someone can offer some help.  For the past month I've had a problem with waking up constantly at night. It started with me having trouble sleeping one night where I kept drifting off into a light sleep kind of state but waking every hour.  Since then, every time I go to sleep I get anywhere from 2-4 hours of sleep but then keep waking up every hour until it's morning. I also have vivid dreams every time I wake up. I do think I'm getting REM sleep because I've had sleep paralysis in between those hours of sleep but I'm not sure I'm getting deep sleep. Some days I wake up feeling tired while others I feel fine.  Anyone have anything similar? Is it also possible that after having this for a month that my body has adjusted to this sleeping pattern? I've tried melatonin and other sleep related teas and lotions to no avail although I haven't tried any sleep meds yet. 
Hello  I'm searching for some help on a problem I have which is now becoming distressing.  I am a 48yr man, 32" waist, 11 stone and 5 6tall and in relatively good health as far as I'm aware.  Every night I wake after 2/3 hours sleep absolutely drenched in sweat with my bedsheets, duvet stuck to me, they are that wet (as am I), afterwards I cannot sleep so have been operating on 2/3 hours a night sleep for several years now.  This problem never used to happen but is now every single night and getting worse.  I sweat at no other times only when I'm asleep.  My bedroom and bedding is not hot nor is it cold, it is the same temperature as it's always been yet this now intolerable and depressing.  I operate on auto pilot.  Why has this started happening and what is causing it.  I have been diagnosed a few years ago with GAD (general anxiety disorder) and five years ago I had a aortic root and valve replacement (my aortic root was dilated by 8.8cm and my valve had stopped working giving me severe aortic regurgitation).  I now have a mechanical valve (st jude conduit) and a false aortic root.  I have had so many tests regarding this problem, as far as i'm aware these tests showed nothing but something must surely be wrong.  I have been tested for overactive thyroid, bacterial endocarditis and so many other things, I really am desperate now and hope somebody can help.  Sometimes my weight drops to about 10.5 stone but slowly builds up again.  I'm confused, depressed and very anxious over this.  Thank you in advance.  I am on no medication apart from Warfarin and Amlopidine (I won't take anything for my anxiety or depression, not tablet wise anyway).  Lee

Hi, I need some advice on sleep if possible. I have never needed much sleep, always got by on 6 hours, but have always had issues when I sleep. I am a light sleeper, have always struggled to switch my brain off and have very sensitive hearing, so sleep with earplugs sometimes. I usually fall straight to sleep, but then wake up around 1 to 2 hours later and struggle to fall back to sleep. When I am asleep, I feel like I am awake and can see things around the bedroom, even with my eyes closed (it's like seeing a photo negative) and often fell like I am looking at myself. Even with earplugs I can still hear things like traffic and snoring. When I try to get back to sleep I seem to just have "deja vu", where I get into a comfy position, doze for 10-15 mins then wake and do the same over and over until I get up for work. As I said, I have never needed sleep as much as some people but the last few weeks have been hard and I'm getting to the point where I am seeing things in the day and struggle to function properly at work. I have tried Kalms herbal tablets and some other over the counter tablets too, which help me fall asleep but once I'm awake they just aid in me feeling groggy.  Any advice would be much appreciated  Many thanks in advance 
I need help or advice. Recently I have moved to a new room and since then I suffer from insomnia. It takes me around 3 or 4 hours to fall asleep, and usually I manage to get a deep sleep only around 4 am (I go to sleep at 12 in the night and should wake up to go to work at 8 am). Sometimes I'm in a half sleep until 4 am.   Before this, I slept in another room and even different flats and everything was perfectly fine. Whenever I go home for the weekend I sleep perfectly fine. I took a night bus and no problem. It seems the problem is only specific to this room. I had a similar problem a year ago in another flat I used to live, but I thought it was too loud and moved out.   I drunk chamomile tea, I donât use computer or phones after 7 pm, I took sleeping pills with Valerian or Melanin (nothing) and stronger (they work if I take two, but I feel terrible the day after). And, I tried going to sleep earlier (9 or 10 pm) and this doesn't change anything. I do a lot of sports (running twice a week, yoga three times and cycle every day to work around 10km). I eat very healthy (home-cooked meals, no coffee, tea, sugar or cheese). I am not stressed or in any way agitated. I air and clean my room regularly, it is quiet and dark. I tried to sleep with earplugs and face mask to no relief. My friends have no problems sleeping in my room.   The doctor cannot find the reason behind it and I have a contract signed for another 6 months and cannot exit it without paying a high fee   
Hello everyone.  I am requesting some serious advice/help for my insomnia issue that has been going on for way too long now.  I am a 32 year old otherwise healthy male living in New York.  This has hands down been the most devastating/frustrating thing that has ever happened to me.  In mid September, nearly three months ago I had a very stressful series of events take place at work which lead to me beginning to wake up well before my alarm clock everyday.  At the time I didn't really think about it, but the anxiety over work was likely causing this to happen.  I would go to work exhausted day in and day out for weeks.  Finally after three weeks or so, I decided to replace my old beat up mattress with a new one thinking THAT was more of the problem.  Again, the work thing I knew was possibly part of the issue, but maybe not the whole issue.  Ironically, just one week after I got my new mattress (which feels fine might I add) i began having more SERIOUS problems where i was now waking up in the middle of the night.  This has now CONTINUED to the current day, short of maybe 7-8 days total.  Like clockwork, sometimes 2-3 or 4am, i wake up in the middle of the night.  Am I still stressed about work?  Yes I am, but not to the point in my opinion where this should still be happening.  I am a zombie everyday, and this has affecting my performance at work.  This has gotten so terrible that I am considering taking time off from work if it doesn't resolve very soon.  I finally went to a sleep doctor last week who after a 30 minute conversation says he believes that the work incident triggered "situational insonmnia" and he believes without a shadow of a doubt that it will go away soon, as it usually lasts "up to three months".  Doctor or not its just hard to beleive him.  Every single solitary night I go in bed calm, thinking this will be the night where things begin to get better, and EVERY single night, there i am, up in the middle of the night.  It should be noted that i typically fall back asleep, but there have been some horrific nights where i haven't.  How I made it through work those few time I'll never know.  I am not on any medications, sleep in a quiet/dark room, and have troubleshot every possible thing to figure out whats wrong.  I even quit coffee over a month ago now thinking that was maybe the cause but it wasn't.  I have not been able to enjoy life for the last few months and am afraid this may become an even more serious problem for me in my life than I think.  All the lack of good sleep is even starting to catch up to me in deeper ways as recently I have even forgotten things here and there and have even developed a slight stutter when in conversation at times.  I have no doubt this is because of the fatigue but it could always be a crazy coincidence.  Either way I need some serious help and advice and anything is much appreciated.  What does everyone think happened to me?  This is all just surreal to me at this stage. 
For the past three or so years, one of my housemates has been suffering from chronic insomnia. I have tried many times to unpick the various factors that I feel may be contributing to this but on analysis there are so many possibilities that I donât even know where to begin. I know that they have sought medical attention about it but there seems to have been no progress. Below is a list of symptoms and lifestyle choices that appear relevant to me:  -          High-stress, long hours work commitments  -          Poor, heavy carb-based diet  -          Frequent consumption of caffeine based drinks (this has decreased significantly but at one point they were consuming energy drinks on a daily basis)  -          Smoking (5-10 per day)  -          Chronic and acute chest pain, intermittent for a number of years  -          Eczema  -          Visibly uncomfortable breathing  -          Habitual and aggressive nail-biting  -          General lack of self-maintenance  There seems to be a mix of what I would consider medical, habitual and attitudinal problems that lead my housemate to give off a constant âon edgeâ aura. If anybody has any advice on how I can help them, it would be much appreciated. Due to their unbelievable stubbornness, this isnât simply a case of âtell them to give up smokingâ.  Thanks

(currently exhausted while typing this) Thanks in advance                     
Please suggest any remedy to control snoring. My husband snore very loud at night. 
Alright, I have some odd sleep issues that began after giving birth to my second child a year ago. Ive seen a neurologist, had an EEG done, brain scans, etc because he thought they were seizures. BUT everything came up clean. I'm at a loss and I'm desperate. So what's happening is when I fall asleep I suddenly wake up terrified with images in my head almost as if I'm still dreaming while awake. They aren't scary images, typically people but I can't place them. I feel like I should know these people but can't remember. I have trouble talking, overall I'm filled with fear. But I'm aware of what's happening. It's as if half of my brain is dreaming and the other half is trying to snap out of it. I can talk myself back to reality after about a minute. But it's the longest minute of my life. Recently during one of these "episodes" I thought I saw someone at my doorway, then as I came back to reality it went away and I realized it's just a door. One of the scariest feelings I have is that I'm not real. That seems so strange to say but that's exactly how I feel during these episodes. I see my husband sleeping next to me and know who he is but I don't feel real. It's awful and I'm so sick of this. Oddly they happen to coincide with hormone changes in my body (without getting too detailed). They happen 5 days in a row then NOTHING until next months hormone changes. I'm working on balancing my hormones right now in hopes that it will help I just want someone to tell me what the hell these things are? Because I feel like going crazy and it's causing some serious stress. I wish someone would say "OMG I have the same thing" so I can breath and realize I'm ok.  
Hi  I have recently been looking around the internet to find all the best options to try out and solve my 10 year insomnia problem. On average, I can only get about 4 hours of sleep by going to bed at 11pm and falling asleep from about 2-4pm to 7pm. I am currently following the common advices including:  - Melatonin pills - At least 2 hrs of exercise per week. - Going to bed at the exact time every day (11pm) - No usage of electronics 2 hrs before going to bed  However, none of these above solutions have significantly helped with my insomnia.  My mind isn't in a depressive nor stressful state aside from my anxity over not getting enough sleep for many years.  Now, I am willing to try more stronger options. Preferrably, I do not want to resort to using pills because of their scary side-effects, namely from prescribed pills like zopiclone. So far, I read about one viable option that might work which is Cognitive Beheavioral Therapy (CBT). I will give this a try, but are there any other stronger options that I should consider as well? 
I can't sleep because I'm scared.  I don't know why, but I feel like I'm floating away every time I shut my eyes or even lie down.  It scares me.  I'm 16 too, so I don't really know what's going on.  And I can't get an appointment with my psychiatrist for a while.  
I take Mirtazapine to help me sleep at night and I've started on an ssri for about the past three weeks, has anyone who started on an ssri had vivid dreams that wake them up and do they go away if you did have the same issue? 
I dont if it has anything to do with sleep disorders. Last night I was sleeping. While i was sleeping, remember thinking about something or a dream. For instance, i was in a social group. Someone in that social group put me down. I didn't feel like anyone liked me. I avoided that group. All of sudden, I started crying or i dont know what it was. I was aware that i was sleeping. It almost felt like my throat was vibrating or something in my body shaking. When i woke up i felt like a lump in my throat as if i cried. There were no tears but it felt so real like that thought triggered something. I was not panicking after waking up. This happenend to me couple of times before. Each time i remember thinking about something about not being liked or how others thought of me. That doesnt bother me.  Even when i think about it, why would that bother me? It might be sleep apnea or something. 
I am 22, female, slightly underweight (but always have been) and I have depresdion/anxiety, currently on no meds. I have been having trouble staying awake and alert during the day, along with sleeping through the night. I fall asleep pretty fast usually (if I can control my racing thoughts thst is) and have vivid dreams right away, then I wake up, in a few minutes I fall asleep again and it repeats. Usually then I am awake at 3 am and don't bother to try to sleep again til 6 am. Very rarely I have terrifying sleep paralysis (literally took me like 30 seconds to find the word paralysis hahah punch me)  this sometimes makes me afraid to fall asleep, I try to avoid sleeping on my back because of this. I feel like I'm in a fog, have trouble thinking, and could take a nap anytime. I used to have problems staying awake in school and at work, it would affect my performance and I would make simple mistakes. No matter how much sleep I get I am still tired, and I know oversleeping is harmful but I can sleep for 10-15 hours.   Caffeine doesn't help, only makes me crash.  
This has been happeneing for a year now. A family member passed away a little over a year ago. Since then i have been getting horrible dreams, not every night but more than I would care to have. The dreams i can deal with, its the feeling that comes along with them. While dremaing, i have this entire body eletric tingling sensation that seems to start in my head and radiates down my spine, throughout my entire body. This occurs only when these dreams happen and i am "watching" the dream. I am not sure if i am paralized during this time as i have never tried to move, i have heard it could be sleep paralysis. This is almost like a painful taingling sensation you get when your arm wake up. The feeling stops as soon as i open my eyes and wake up, and starts right back up as soon as i close them and slip back into the dream again. I have changed positions when i wake up but the feeling comes back as soon as my eyes are shut and dremaing. This feeling only happens with these dreams.   I do have have a slipped disk in my neck. Can this feeling be realted to that or something different?   
My sleeping pattern is messed up. For the past two to three years I have never been able to wake up before say 11 comfortably. I find it hard to go to sleep before 12 and find it very hard to fall asleep without listening to an audiobook, podcast or music. I also use weed to help me sleep. I am at university and my course has lectures over Skype, they are recorded so I can watch them back anytime. This means that it is far to easy to sleep in, as there is normally no real consequences for sleeping in.  I wonder also of it is part physiological? I don't mind spending time on my own, I would say I am somewhat introverted. I notice that my very extraverted friends have no trouble waking up. They literally bounce out of bed. Could this because they don't particularly like spending time on their own? When I wake, I pretty much always hit the snooze button, sometimes this can last for 2 hours. I actually love the feeling at the time but always regret it when I do get up. I guess an extrovert wouldn't do this because he would get up and see who's about.   This has been going on for years, I've never been a morning person and I'm scared this is becoming a deep seeded habit. Recently I have been trying the Paleo diet to see if this affects it anyway.   Anyone having the same troubles? Any books that would be helpful would be much appreciated. Cheers.   
I have been a sleep talker my whole life. It hasn't really been a problem, it's mostly mumbling, my girlfriend finds it cute. Unfortunately, recently, I have started doing some random actions while sleeping. We recently got a dog, and I have been partially waking up from a dream that I think our dog is in our room. Unfortunately I think the dream is real and start grabbing at my girlfriend thinking she is the dog, scaring her to death. Last night I grabbed her really hard and was squeezing her for some reason, which is not acceptable because she has compression fractures and other back problems. Before the dog once I woke up once and ran around the room thinking my girlfriend was badly hurt, I think she spilled hot oil on herself in my dream. I was just wondering if anybody knew of anyway for me to stop this from happening. Or at least reduce the severity of it. It was mostly harmless before but it's getting worse. I cannot stand the thought of my girlfriend being afraid of me.  
so for 3 days, I was sick, constantly sleeping, not eating, barely drinking, but yesterday I started eating a little but, but feeling so horrible afterward, so eating was rare, but later that night, my stool was black even my pee had a reddish tint, and last night, I was boiling hot, I wasn't able to sleep, and I've had massive lower stomach pain, and every time I stand up, there's a sharp pain coming from the side of my head, and I'm constantly feeling like I'm gonna vomit, what's wrong with me, I couldn't even find anything on the internet about it, I'm a 17-year-old transgender male (so female body), 5'4" 174lb 
I have been suffering from fear of not sleeping since I was 15 y/o. Now I have 32 and I am confronting a conflict. My husban want to have a baby, but I am afraid of getting crazy during the proces due to my lack of sleep. I have tried everithing to heal my insomnia from meditation-yoga to strong medications. Now the only meds that help me is ativan. I don't want to take any medication while pregnant- could affect the fetus. I feel hopeless, Does any woman with my condition ever have a baby? I appreciate all your help (sorry for my spelling, english is not my firts language) 
I take 1.0 for sleep and it seems to help me fall asleep fine but does anyone else wake up after 5 or 6 hours and are wide awake? Wondering if this is because of the clonazepam. 
Hi,  I have been struggling with a sleeping issue for quite some time now and I wanted to post my symptoms to seek advice. I'm currently undergoing various tests and have tested on an embletta 2 times and a polysomnography. All results were uneventful as this tends to be a fairly temperamental issue. Doctors do not believe I have sleep apnoea and prescribed me with acid reflex medication which had no effect. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder around 4 years ago and since have been taking 100mg sertraline once a day (symptoms were there before I started taking this and have got increasingly worse over time). His symptoms tend to be at their worst at night. I would be hugely grateful if anyone has any advice or experienced anything similar as it's massively effecting my life and to be honest it's scary when it happens.   Please see below a schedule of events (times aren't a reflection on normal sleeping pattern I usually sleep from 10pm but the same thing happens)  13/11 - bed at 2.30   All lights off, fan on   2.45 Start feeling quite drowsy but feels a bit un natural (regular occurrence) Chest a little wheezy.  3- drift off but mind feels a little scrambled, random thoughts that I can't seem to control all the time  3.10 first episode- wake up and sit up gasping for breath uncontrollably whilst feeling my chest- feels like heart has stopped or slows but settles down, feel a 'rumble' in heart area, similar to a hunger rumble. Head feels dizzy/confused, eye on left feels slightly droopy. Wheezy breathing. This all lasts for about 30 seconds and symptoms are practically gone- I fall back to sleep immediately almost uncontrollably. Chest muscles all feel quite tight. Lightly grinding my teeth, body also feels jittery.  3.15 2nd episode - exactly the same as above but slightly more intensified, scares me but fall back to sleep quickly.  3.20 3rd episode - same symptoms but again more intense. Struggle to find breath when first sit up heart heat feels irregular, this episode is enough to wake me up and keep me awake. Feel confused and concerned. Whilst waking up properly I have mild moments of feeling like my hearts stopping again and gasping once or twice before again it calms down. Heart/chest now feel a little strained or 'weak'  This is generally what happens to me around 4-5 times a week. I would really appreciate some advice. Thanks   
Hello,  my problem is i sleep a lot , i heard that a normal adult should sleep 6 hours , but i'm sleeping at least 9 hours and 12 hours in weekends , any help to reduice number of hours ?   i also have a wierd phenomen , very often i'm stuck in my dream : like i'm telling to my self (inconciently) i can't wake up till I find a solution to this algorithmic or mathematical problem ( i study computer science ) and it's an unsolved (or false) problem so i'm trying to solve it for more then 3 hours then i surrender by  giving an random(false) solution ; it happen to me very often  any suggestion or help is welcome. thank you. 
Nearly 2 years ago I suffered with big time stress. And since then I have not slept one wink of natural sleep. And only a handful of times with drugs.i have had all the tablets for sleeping you can think of but nothing works. I have had loads of different tablets for anxiety but again they don't work. It seems that I am stuck in fight or flight mode and on constant alert all the time. Has any one else suffered from this or knows an answer  
I'm at my wits end.   I'm 40, and all my life had disturbed sleep.  I have a very traumatic childhood and depression for years.    But here's the paradox - I am now finally at a place in life where I am happy and have low anxiety.  But the sleep disturbances are worse than ever and nothing helps.   There is one common pattern, I wake up and am still in some dream like state - I think that I'm a little girl who's been left alone in the house and am dreading my parents coming home/can't find them.   This stage happens not long after falling asleep as my husband is still out working and I'm alone in bed.   I've tried counselling, exercise, alcohol, weed.     I just don't understand why my brain seems to be keeping me in a traumatic state when I genuinely am finally happy with my life.   When I'm walking around the house half-awake, I find myself eating food which helps an initial return to sleep.  It's making me gain weight and my teeth are crumbling.    Please help, I feel I have nowhere else to turn after the counselling session belittled me and told me 'it's only bad dreams, it can't hurt you'.  
Hi I'm a 31 year old male and the last few nights I have found truly terrifying. I have suffered with insomnia since my teenage years and suffered with panic attacks and anxiety since my mid 20's. I had a few bouts of sleep paralysis a few years ago but when i spoke to my doctor about it they almost looked as if i was speaking crazy talk to them, so i shrugged it off and just carried on as normal. But in hindsight these episodes of SP were completely insignificant compared to what i have experienced in the last few weeks.The first recent one was pretty scary< i was dreaming away as normal, nothing frightening just normal nonsensical dreaming when suddenly it felt like a car was dropped on my chest, feeling like im suffocating while a high voltage current was being passed through my head. It didn't just feel like a sensation it was REALLY painful. I was trying to move but couldnt i was completely paralysed and fully aware of not being able to move. During experiencing all this (i know this sounds wierd), I'm looking down at my own body watching myself struggling trying to scream for help. I felt fully aware and awake during this. I dont know how long this went on for but i eventually managed to break out of it. I felt very disturbed by this but went and got a glass of water and tried to go back to sleep. just as i was falling back to sleep I felt the paralysis grip me again, accompanied by the electrocution feeling in my head and also some very disturbing buzzing/ grinding sounds. It happened to me a few more times over the following weeks with similar symptoms, the feeling of electrocution, paralysis, sometimes a feeling of disconnection from my body, disturbing sounds, feelings of suffocation. etc. I'm a pretty strong minded person so i was just trying to battle through it, well that was until 2 nights ago. I had a kind of mild SP event and was ripped out of my sleep at about 2am. i was unable to get back to sleep so just watched TV all night. Then at around 8am i must have drifted off. i woke up in an extreme SP state laying on my side. i had all the usual things, electrocution, panic, unable to breathe, but this time it felt like my heart was bouncing out of my chest in a completely messed up rhythm almost like it was going to stop, it didnt feel like a panic attack, ive had a few and havent experienced this before, it wasnt just like rapid panic beats or palpitations. i felt like i was dying and the life was leaving my body. just before i broke out of it it felt like what i can only describe as a large tentacle was squirming its way up my body. i am too terrified to sleep. I havent slept in over 48 hours. Everytime i start drifting off it feels like im having a massive surge of adrenaline stopping me from sleeping as if my body is convinced Im gonna die if i sleep. phoned my doctor explaining this and just had a 'sorry it's not my speciality all this'. im at wits end and the insane feeling is starting to creep in from sleep deprivation  Sorry about the massive wall of text, im just hoping someone will have advice for me about this as im REALLY shaken up and anxious as hell right now    
First off, I'm an 18 year-old guy who has never experienced sleep issues in the past and throughout the school year would nap every day after school. I realized I was sleeping way too much and began to think I needed to make amends and start sleeping less.  And here we are, because life is cruel  Within the last month, I've been having the persistent issue of falling asleep at night. I don't seem to have this problem trying to fall asleep during the day if I'm intending to nap. I get drowsy as usual and try to go to bed, but now I've developed this issue where my feet get this tingling/ticklish feeling on the soles and I have no choice but to clench them and/or move them around to get rid of the feeling. The feeling always comes back within 5 seconds of me moving around when I'm having the issue. Because of this, I can't fall asleep normally and when I have an episode I tend to get angry at myself, to the point where there's no possible way I'll fall asleep after becoming upset. My solution this past month has been to stay up until I literally cannot stay up any longer to fall asleep, and it goes without saying, hasn't been good at all for my sleep cycle.  I've tried researching it and I see a resemblance in Restless Leg Syndrome, except it's only the soles of my feet. I'm also pretty darn sure I don't have diabetes. 
I have taken Tegratol for over 30 years and have always had trouble sleeping. I have decided to stop all medication for sleep ie. Amitriptyline.  I am now taking, off the shelf Nytol. Does anyone know if this is a problem? 
Last week I had what can only be described as my first Night Terror - it fit the bill from the research I've done online. Last night though, something happened which has really unnerved me - I'd been watching TV with my wife and kids and fell asleep on the sofa. I woke up, very sleepy, and went to the toilet. In the toilet I started coughing, I was struggling to breathe, and then I blanked out completely. When I became "aware" again, I was on my knees in the hallway, crying like a baby in my wife's arms. All I can remember is the coughing, a feeling of desperately NEEDING to escape, and that's it.  My wife tells me that they heard a massive noise from the bathrooom, rushed out to see what was happening, and I was literally smashing up the  bathroom by flailing my arms, and then sunk to my knees and crawled out into the hallway.  Now, I was awake (although sleepy) when this started, so... and, I just don't know. Am I potentially a danger to my family? I have no control over this, how far can it go? How can this happen when I am awake?   Also, this morning when I woke up, it was almost on me again, from waking up, I shot out of bed, panicking, breathing ridiculously hard, right on the edge - luckily i was able to reign it in and stop it from developing.  Help please, I have no history of panicking, I am a man who really doesn't fear anything, and suddenly I am scared out of my wits about what is happening. The "after-feeling" from these "attacks" leave me shaking, terrified, checking the dark corners of the rooms, and this is really not me. Help. 
Hi all! So I don't think I have a sleep disorder or anything, but I have a few weird things that happen. Most nights, I fall asleep without any recollection. It's like I just suddenly fall asleep and I wake up to heaps of messages from people I was talking to because I just suddenly fell asleep and I don't remeber it. Another thing is that often, most nights, I'll wake up between 3 and 4. I don't know why and it's also just sudden and I feel wide awake when I do. Any ideas why this happens?? Thank you  
Hello,  I've had a sleep study done and my GP has received a letter from the lung function unit of my local hospital stating my AHI is 28. My Epworth is 10 out of 24.  The letter states: "this test indicates that there is evidence of sleep disordered breathing and your patient has been listed for a trial of CPAP."  I've since received a letter from the unit inviting me to an appointment to collect a CPAP machine for a week's trial. Another appointment will follow the following week.  My questions are:  1) Am I formally diagnosed as having sleep apnea? 2) Should I disclose this to the DVLA? I've read on their site that I need to disclose if I have sleep apnea and it affects my ability to drive or if I have OSAS. I'm not tired at the wheel.  3) what's the difference between OSA and OSAS? 4) Presumably, I'd have to disclose OSA / OSAS to my car insurance company? 5) What impact is a diagnosis going to have on my premium? I've 5 years no claims. Never been involved in an accident.  Any help would be gratefully received!  Thanks   
Back in 2009 I had my gallbladder removed, I was 20. No problems until I had to stay up one night to go to a doctors appointment the next morning, I usually doce over this and say whatever I'll sleep the next night. That didn't happen I was up for 48 hours and damn it was a wreck, I took lots and lots of tamazapam and just zoned out for about 14 hours. Ever since then I've been getting around about 4 hours a night before waking up and having to find a way to force myself to get back to sleep for another 4 hours, depending on how stressed I'll become will depend on that return to sleep cycle. I Just have no idea how I'm suppose to function within society and have a job and all that when my sleep is utter gabarage.  I've been able to stay up for 24 hours and get 12 hours sleep no problem for this, they perscribed my antidepressants and that didn't help. What am I suppose to do? I mean I had one of those studies done at those sleep centers they said my sleep was all over the place, 1 down to 9 then back to 4 then to 1 and I was awake. At the moment I'm trying to regain myu sleep cycle back by taking diazapam mixed in with melatonin and that ain't working. Currently I think it's been about 2 weeks, with about 2-3 hours a night, kind of losing touch at reality at this point. And yes I've exercised it and it doesn't make any difference, infact exercise brings me back, from sleep hygine to anything else it's a really hindrance to get this stuff under control. 
This is new to me..supposedly supposed to help. 
For about 4 months not I get this sensation usually just as I'm about to fall asleep. It feels like a rush of warm electricity going to my brain and it comes over me like a wave and I can't move. I feel it happen and I say to myself to wake up and wake up but I never can. When I finally can pull myself out of this state I wake up shaking and tingling all over and feeling like I'm suffocating. Has anybody ever experienced this before? It's truly terrifying and any family member I tell just calls it "nightmares" but that's surely not what this is. Help please!!  
So, last night I couldn't fall asleep until after 5:30 am. When I did I would go into a dream (sometimes I was half awake, I would close my eyes and a dream image would appear or lucid  I would then awake after a minute or less. This would happen constantly with frequent awakening s out of short dreams for an hour and a half and then I couldn't sleep anymore even though I was extremely exhausted and can barely keep my eyes open. Sometimes the dreams were nightmares or me dreaming that I was awake in my bed. It was hard to distinguish between dream and reality it's as if my mind/body were fighting the sleep . Has anyone experienced this?  
I have had lucid dreams ever since I was a child. Recently it has taken a weird turn.  The dream always starts with me waking up in bed, and then I start feeling scared. Just a feeling of terror. At this point I realize I am asleep and try to wake myself up. Usually by screaming WAKE UP and trying to get out of bed, but I cant. until finally I am jolted awake and can sit up. Then I will get a feeling of terror again and realize that I am still sleeping. And I go through the whole process again, Usually 5-10 times before I actually wake up. Has anyone had anything like this happen to them? 
Hi I just wondered if anyone had anxiety, fear of going to bed , falling asleep and what the possible causes of this may be and also how the individual coped with this?   
Hi everyone my name is Joel and I've been suffering with narcolepsy from at least the age of 12, I'm 28 years old and was only diagnosed 3years ago!   As as a young boy growing up I was always know for my sleeping and then became numb to the word lazy as it seemed that I lacked the drive to do anything I put my mind to, it became the norm to assume that I would start something and never finish it which was very disheartening at the best of times. It started off with me falling asleep after meals and any time I was in a relaxed environment and as abnormal as this was it went unnoticed because I would spend most my nights up because of the amount of sleep I've had in the day so it looked like I was making up for lost sleep. (Wrong assumption) My condition started getting scary and I noticed that I would stop breathing as I was sleeping and at the same time I couldn't move! It was like I was going to die and there was nothing I could do I could feel myself going and suddenly at the last moment I'd snap out fighting for breath, after months of this happening I soon got to grips with what was happening and could almost anticipate when it was going to happen because I would get this feeling like butterflies in my stomach as if the gravity beneath me got lighter and I was floating. I then noticed that 95% of these attacks occurred when laying on my back and at night only as I got older it would start happening in the day and in any sleeping position. Over the years these attacks would vary between a couple times a day to a couple times in a week.  My dreams seem so real and vivid it's unreal and I often get scared in my home. I've had out of body experiences on another type of level and last night something weird and terrifying happended to me, before I fell asleep I felt a presence in my home and I was freaked out and scared to sleep, as I fell asleep I feel into that state of not being able to move instantly which is the norm for me but on this occasion I heard my door open and footsteps to my bed at this point I was helpless and jumping in my paralysed body, I felt my bed dip and something laid and spooned me from behind at this point I was hysterical and somehow managed to break free, as scared as I was I couldn't get the strength to get up and drink some water and get myself together this is not unusual for this to happen to me and it often can happen straight after an attack as I'm to tired to get up I get pulled straight back into what ever it is that is attacking me. Ive noticed that when I pray as I'm laying there helplessly it gets more violent as if I'm p*ssing what ever it is off and that where ever I am in my life spiritually mirrors how I'm effected in the night. I just really want this to stop I have no peace!!  Is there anyone else out there that understands what I'm feeling. I don't want to seem like I'm losing my mind but this is just basic stuff that I've experienced a lot more has happened but I've just had enough I'm under no medication as the madaffinil had no effect on me and my condition stops me from keeping appointments with my neurologist I feel alone and without help or guidance and my quality of life is at an all time low as Im depressed a lot of the time and don't understand why. And tbh this is the first time I've vented about my feeing and I don't think I've come to terms with my illness. 
I've had insomnia for nearly two months now - going from zero hour nights to not being able to get off until 2/3am.   I've been given different sleeping pills by doctors - but they won't give me anymore now because I've been on them too long.  Zopiclone was a life saver for a while until o ran out.  Now my GP has put me on citalopram as she believes my insomnia is down to depression. I'm on day 10 of this and haven't seen any improvements yet.  I also have a CBT session today.  I have done everything I can - have been off work for 2 weeks to get a routine back and nope - my mind won't let me sleep.  Please help I can't live like this . 
Hello folks,  Yet another problem I;ve been having and which continues.  I have been suffering from constant severe, chronic insomnia for just over 2 years.  I had no history of this prior to 2013 - I generally used to go to bed late, but fell-asleep quite quickly (with the TV on timer to go off) and generally only awoke when the TV came back on at getting-up time.  If I did need to get up during the night, to visit the toilet or to get a drink, I would go back to bed and fall-asleep again quickly.  All changed in July 2013.  I had a possible exposure to HIV while abroad, convinced myself I had  caught the virus, and severe insomnia kicked-in (followed by anxiety and then depression).  I was in the Czech Republic at the time, and remember lying-awake for most of the night for almost 2 weeks.  The only thing I could use to try to dose-off was wine, but of course that only resulted in short spells of poor quality sleep.  I came home and visited by doctor, who realised how bad the situation was for me, and he prescribed Zopiclone.  I had various modern HIV tests, all negative, but I had already diagnosed myself and the insomnia was ingrained.  I also had other issues which affected my mental health (and contributed to the insomnia): a relationship breakdown from a few years before that I had not properly dealt with; no job; and ageing parents, especially my mother who had just been diagnosed with dementia.   Since then, I have been on either Zopliclone, Zolpidem or, more recently, Temazepam every night.  All of them seem to be gradually losing their effect.  Initially, I was getting good sleep (length and quality) on them, but I'm now having even greater difficulty falling-asleep, and am waking early and unable to get back to sleep.  I'm also on an anti-depressant called Trazodone, which I'm told should help with insomnia, but it doesn't seem to help me.  Foolishly, but in desperation, I started to turn to alcohol again, recently in large quantities.  It would knock me out, but has created other problems.  It makes my depression and anxiety worse, and has affected my liver function blood tests and possibly worse - adding to my anxieties generally and when I go to bed.  I've also tried CBT (on the NHS), relaxation techniques, relaxation CDs, hypnotherapy, etc - all to no avail.  My doctor this week increased my Temazepam dosage from 10mg nightly to 20mg nightly.  I'm still finding it hard to fall-asleep and waking early and unable to get back over.  I just feel I am stuck with this situation permanently, because negative life events are constantly on my mind.  Has anyone any suggestions as to how I can break this cycle of sleeplessness?  Many thanks, Gavin. 
Wife has had insomnia for several weeks, GP has recommended sleep restriction. Went to bed at 3am for 15 mins, no sleep so got up, tried again at 4, 5, 6, still awake at 06:30.  GP expected her to get 5 or 6 hours from 3 till 9.  From what I've read online most sources say to get up at 9am regardless of how little sleep, but notes from gp suggest she should keep trying - so might have got to sleep at 2pm then expected to sleep till 8pm. She was so fed up at 6:30 that she resorted to half a zopiclone which GP obviously wants her off (so does she!)  Spoke to (different) GP who advised the "get up at 9 regardless" approach but was clearly not sure.... So which is it? Get up at set time even with no sleep, or keep trying till she passes out? 
For the past 6-8 months I've been having trouble getting to sleep and once I do it's hard to stay asleep.  Weather I feel like I could fall asleep as soon as I get into bed or if I just relax in bed it takes me often at least 2 hours to fall asleep. And I get these twitches/aches in my hips and legs that jualt me and wake me up or stop me from sleeping.  On top of this I wake up literally every night between 2-4 and wake up at 6 and can't get back to sleep.  I've tried relaxing, watching tv or reading before bed. Exersize. Laying in the dark and silence. I've even tried sleep videos on YouTube.   Nothing seems to make a difference. I'm so tired all the time because I haven't had a decent night sleep in months and it's now become a cycle that's wearing me down physically and mentally.   Any advice would be very appreciated  
I'm in a serious flare Sle and for the last month I'm lucky to get 2 hours a night..... any suggestions? 
I'd welcome feedback from anyone taking melatonin as an aid to sleep. What daily dose do you take,does it take a few days/weeks to become effective, do you take it continually or have a break, does it help, any side effects? I prefer the idea of taking a naturally occuring hormone like melatonin than taking zopiclone, which has a reputation for shortening your life with continuous use  
Just wondering if anyone has had similar experience?  I'm 32. Up until Dec 14 I used to go to bed at 10pm and wake at 6. I fell asleep within minutes and didn't dream excessively. I slept right through and felt refreshed.  Then in December 2014 I noticed I was dreaming more. By March 15 it was every night and it felt as though I was up all night. In Oct 15 I was put on 15mg mirtazapine which I've been on since but I'm tapering down and on 7.5mg now. The dreaming is constant. Every night. I went to a sleep clinic and was diagnosed with hyper-vigilance and told that I need to see a psychologist. I'm already seeing one and she believes that CBT will help.  I just can't see an end to this. I've had a rubbish sleep every night now for almost 2 years. I've had numerous other tests/scans done and all are normal.  Can anyone help or has anyone else suffered with this?  Thank you  Paul  
I've had sleep paralysis for over twenty years. I used to think I was crazy because I would have these continual dreams, almost every night, where I was frozen and I could see my bedroom, but I'd hear these noises and feel as though something was coming upon me. With the rise of internet use (I lived in a very rural town!), I eventually realized it was sleep paralysis about 7-8 years ago. I remember first seeing the paintings of people with demons on their chest and thinking, "YES, THAT'S IT!" and being excited that others had the same problem.   For the last five years, it's gotten much worse. It used to be something that occured a few times a month, but now it is something that happens a few times a week. This has been for the last few years. My husband calls it my "night terrors" because even if he tries to wake me, (and I'm aware of him trying to wake me, while i'm "sleeping" I just start screaming, murmuring, shaking, and won't wake up until I"m completely still. Even when I'm aware of him trying to wake me, or I'm aware that I'm in a state of paraylsis, I can't get out of it until I force myself to calm down and breathe regularly. Often, I will see a shadow coming at me and I will have to focus on this shadow (which is terrifying) until I come out of it. It's like the focus helps me. I know that I regularly have to try to force myself to breathe deeply to get out of it. My husband says he will see me trying to gasp for air and my eyes will be rolled into the back of my head while I"m sleeping and tring to come out of it.   Either way, it's terrible and has made it so I only get about three hours of sleep every night. If I don't have an incident, I wake up when I normally would and find myself watching reruns of friends to fully wake myself up before going back to sleep because if I go to sleep in a halfasleep manner, I know I'll go through an incident.   Lately, I've noticed a pattern. I don't regularly have the visions that I used to have where I could see my actual room as it was. Instead, I'll have dreams that are very vivid and routine (almost like watching a TV show over a long period of time), that contain people I know or have known, but the entire time, I have the same feeling I had when I was in my normal state of paralysis. It's almost like I know I'm dreaming, know I can have full control over what I do, and yet--I don't have control. I can get myself out of the "dream" in the same manner as normal (by focusing), but it has become almost impossible as the dream (which is familiar) has become more terrifying over the past few months. It actually has become a night terror, to the point where I don't want to sleep.   I've gone to a few doctors and have had tests done, but--of course--this never occurs when I'm being tested.   Over the last few months, something odd has happened. I've started having these vivid dreams where there are people in them who i don't know in real life, but I feel like I know. Like I wake up wondering how they are and it stresses me out all day wondering how they are doing.   Last night, I had a particularly vivid incident where I was in bed with a woman and we were discussing what to do next (like we had something we were planning to do.) She disappeared, and another person came through a door and grabbed me by the shoulders and started yelling. I remember them in my face, holding my shoulders to the point that they hurt when I woke up, and then this WOOSH was heard and they evaporated into a wall. And I walk almost immediately and my husbad was freaked out because apparently, my entire body had jerked off the bed. Not like a supernatural thing, but like I'd pushed myself up to jump, full body, up in the air. And then I woke up, breathing heavily.   Anyways. I don't know what I'm looking for. I'm just wondering if anyone has had similar experiences. I'm getting freaked out and my sleep has become hilarious because I don't do it all because these dreams and this paralyis has made me terrified of doing so.   Anyone have any input or similarties?

Hey my names Darren, posted  before but thought id give it another shot.  life is good, i have a good business a newborn baby and a surportive partner.  The problem which is crippling my life is i have anxiety in the fact i worry i wont sleep again. everynight is the same routine a bit like groundhog day, take my meds, serequel and clomipramine around 9pm than head to bed praying i sleep. every night i get to sleep but if i have a bad night and it gets late i have the back up of zopiclone or ambien.   I recently see a pychatrist who recommended more meds or switching meds which wasnt very enlightening  ive had CBT which wasnt helpful   I suggested to the pychatrist that i need to face the fear, but i need the back up of being put to sleep if after say 48 hours i couldnt sleep. this gives me the confidence to face the fear of being up for more than one night with no sleep and reasurance that if the unlikely event happened say after 30 - 40 hours the anxiety kept me from sleeping i could be put to sleep.  This phobia is completely reducing the quaity of my life, cant go out late, cant go on holidays cant stay out.   i recently went to papworth hospital to see a sleep scientist who said he hasnt seen this problem before in the fact i sleep but worry i wont sleep.   If anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated as im finding all doors closed and losing the will to live     
Iâm begging for some help. I donât sleep. Not properly. I thought this would have resolved itself by now but it is still going on. My brain prevents me from sleeping and this is completely beyond my control. This started from stress â every time I would sense myself drifting off, I would have a surge of adrenaline â almost like the feeling of drifting off provoked me to remember something important. This continued and continued for weeks. Eventually I would fall asleep, but only for an hour or so of dream sleep and then wake up. Now I have no control over this mechanism. I do not fall into proper sleep at all. Every single time my brain starts to slow, to move into stage 2 of sleep, I am awoken. A part of my brain has trained itself to react to the sensation of falling asleep by waking me back up. I donât know if this is some problem with my thalamus or whether the problem is in a different part of the brain. The sensation of falling asleep acts as a stimulus for the conditioned fight or flight response. Nothing I do can resolve this and I fear it is just going to continue indefinitely until I die from sleep deprivation. I have tried all sorts of different methods, but nothing works, I can go into a very light stage of sleep in which I can still sense all of my surroundings. But I cannot EVER progress past this, something inside is waking me back up. Pills as strong as mitrazapine and zopiclone will make me feel woozy and strange, so much so that I keep zoning out and going cross-eyed. But these pills still fail to put me into a deep sleep. Nothing can override this mechanism, I will just lie in bed all night, my eyes rolling under my eyelids and my mouth hung open, but something in my brain is preventing me from loosing consciousness. I am just awake all night. I have not properly slept for 2 months, even though I can feel my brain constantly trying to shut down and my eyes closing themselves, I will ALWAYS be prevented from sleeping. I am physically and mentally exhausted and have developed muscular spasms in my arms, legs and head. I donât know how this problem can be resolved and it makes my cry to say it but I donât think it can be. Something like ECT may work but I donât think it will get rid of this learnt mechanism which is clearly deeply deeply etched into my synapses.  People think that I am in control of this but I am not. I donât sleep. Ever. Something has gone wrong with my brain and so I will be prevented from sleeping indefinitely. Please, if anybody thinks they know how this might be resolved then advice would be greatly appreciated. My family and Doctors just think I'm depressed and that I'm sleeping more than I realise. I do not want to die from this or loose my memories and cognitive function. Apologies for such an extreme sounding post. 
Prescribed zopiclone and amitryline. worried about taking too much.  any advice appreciated.  
Hi..  i am a university student.. 19 years old... I have a problem sleeping during exam days...  I was totally healthy 3 years ago...  3 years ago, during my exams when i went to bed for sleep , a thought came in my mind that how do we sleep.. i started thinking that i could not sleep... i started thinking that i have forgotten how to sleep... but anyhow i fell asleep 2 hours later that night... since that night i started fearing about sleeping in exam days...  whenever i go to sleep during exam days, a thought comes that i could not sleep so that i will be tired tommorrow... so that i cant study tommorrow or i cant do good in exam because i will be sleepy ...  since then this vicious cycle has started...  even before going to bed my feet start getting because of fear that i cant sleep. My heart beat rises....what should i do? I know its all bcz of my negative thoughts but thoughts have gone stronger over time and i csnt get rid of them 
I have often had trouble with insomnia â but nothing that has lasted this long.     Usually if I have one sleepless night â I get into a spiral meaning I wonât sleep the next night so on and so on.     Usually, Iâll go to the docs and take one sleeping pill, which will get me out of the cycle, but this time around I go to be feeling so anxious about not sleeping I just donât sleep.     I have been taking Zopiclone 7.5mg for about 9 days. I go to bed  around 10pm, and tell myself Iâll sleep. I end up tossing and turning until about 12am where I give up and take the sleeping pills.     I just donât know what to do from here? Itâs never lasted this long and I just want a natural nights sleep.     Itâs affecting my work, my relationships and my social life. I focus my entire day on trying to think of ways of how to sleep. I canât stop thinking about it because I just want it so much.     Any advice?  Will it go away? 
32 y/o American mom of 3. Six months ago I had an isolated incident of what I call a brain zap. I was sitting on the couch with my husband, it was late. All of the sudden I felt a zap in my brain. I put my head back, closed my eyes, and covered my ears. It passed as quickly as it came. Initially I thought maybe I was about to black out. Fast forward to 7/5/16 I was standing outside of my office at 9:30 am ready for the day, talking to my broker when all of the sudden, ZAP! This zap causes me to fall to the ground. No reflexes, meaning I smashed my face into the pavement and was taken to the ER. Drs at the ER did a Cat Scan, blood test, found nothing. I followed up with my doctor, he sent me to Nuerologist, cardiologist, ENT. I've had full blood work up twice, MRI, MRA, EEG. Nothing everything is normal, except, I'm now having zaps every night as I'm falling asleep. Right at the moment of true sleep ZAP! Heart is then beating fast, gasping for air. I can almost feel it right before it happens. I took myself to the ER again this Friday and they prescribed me xanex for aniety. I admit since its been happening every night I am NOW anxious, but have never, ever been before. I'm looking for anyone who might have insight on this. I'm worried about partial seziurs, or encephalitis, or maybe something more in the brain. Can anyone relate? I am generally healthy, no medications, work out (although not since this started). Since the fall I've also been diagnosed with vertigo from knocking a crystal out in my ear, although I'm not sure that, that's what's going on. I'm experiencing brain fog, and short term memory issues since the fall, or onset of zaps. I'm honestly scared. I have three kids and now doctors are telling me not to drive (I'm a relator) and still have no diagnosis! Help.  
I'm a 20 yr old male who for the past nights could not sleep very sleep verybwell. I close my eyes and I have a dream but I'm awake still I can hear everything out side of my dream. On top of that when I lay down to sleep my head feels light and my body gets all numb.l, freaks me out like my body is shutting down. Any suggestions ? 
i have been having sleep problems for 6 months now. have difficulty in dropping off and staying asleep. i usually drop off and my body jerks me awake. i have gone a whole night not sleeping only for my wife to say i was snoring? is that possible?. anyway docs say i could have sleep apnoa, i been booked in 3 times in last six months for tests only for them to cancel each time. could my sleep apnoa be causing my insomnia/anxiety at bed time? thanks for reading 
I am experiencing a hypnagogic jerk that's a little different than the others, and it is frustrating. The instant I feel that I am going to drift to sleep, I get a twitch/contraction on my anal area, I wake up, and repeats.  The feeling is similar to the natural contraction of the anal sphincter area when finishing to pee.â¦ I am now conscious of this and has become a vicious cycle, and have trouble falling to sleep.  I am wondering if anyone has had/have this condition? I have done some searches and it seems like something thatâs not very common with insomnia sufferers.  I am on occasional .5 mg Apralozam (Xanax) right now for anxiety, but I donât know whether it is the meds or the anxiety or withdrawal in between doses. 
Hi everyone,   Basically, I've been to my GP, had full bloods, they tested my thyroid function, they tested for anemia, diabetes, (as they all have certain symptoms I show, including fatigue) my kidney function, white blood cells, etc, and I had an MRI and an awake EEG, they all came back in normal range they said.. I've had numerous symptoms, mental and physical, but I accept the results of course, even if I feel a little at a loss.. I asked my GP to refer me to a sleep clinic, to rule out a sleep disorder, it's the only test I've not had done, and I have symptoms. The symptoms I have are, excessive day time sleepiness, to utter exhaustion, sleeping and napping constantly throughout the day, (24 hours the other day and I was told this is normal?) vivid nightmares and dreams every night, sleep paralysis, waking up to see hallucinations, fragmented sleep, waking up a lot in the night, etc. All I wanted to do was rule out a sleep disorder, and I had to practically beg her to refer me. They made me feel like a hypochondriac, fair enough, perhaps I can seem that way, but I feel I have enough real symptoms to warrant my appointment, but still, she was  a tad patronzing, rather cold, and dismissive. She said because my awake EEG seemed normal I could not have a sleep disorder. All I want to to is totally rule it out, and will accept its psychological as she says, after we can rule this out. I do have depressive episodes throughout my life, and yes, am rather low at the moment, and am not ruling this out as a cause, but I just feel there's something more.. but will admit, perhaps I am wrong. Is she right? Is a daytime normal EEG definitive proof? I feel utterly deflated. I wish GP's would work on their bedside manner.   Anyway, thanks for listening. 
I have been suffering debilitating insomnia for ten months. Sometimes I can fall asleep pretty fast, but I can't stay asleep for long. I wake up every one to two hours. If I awake at 5, I can't really fall back asleep. In general I can't sleep past 7 or 7:30 and not able to nap. I also have very low testosterone levels and high cortisol after midnight. But, the high cortisol and low T is due to long term insomnia. Any other thoughts on what's keeping me from staying asleep? 
im currently being treated for depression anxiety and insomnia. my brain is my enemy and it always finds a way to make me suffer. im on 30mg of mirtazapine which i take. it was great to start with knocked me out cold. however it doesnt seem to work anymore. last few days i have dropped the mirt and reached for alcohol because my mood is so low. when i drink i feel myself again,however next day is always a shocker. today i have decided to go back to mirtazapine has i have had few days off it. i also have some zopiclone which has been in the cupboard a few months and wondering if i could take both?? what you think? 
I have been on Zopiclone for two weeks now.  Every night I go to bed with the thought of not taking them - but I end up just lying there and giving in at 12am and taking it.  I only have two tablets left and I've been waking up anxious and thinking about this everyday.  What happens when I can't sleep ? I cry when I don't sleep a wink and feel really depressed - sometimes having to call in sick to work.  I just want to sleep naturally again.  Help  
Im a teenager and i have had a problem in the past 2 years that whenever i hear loud noises (actual noises not exploding head syndrome) like my alarm clock or when my dad was banging on something with a hammer while i was asleep i would wake up angry   The only major example is about 1-2 years ago in the morning about 6 a.m. i woke up to get ready for the bus then when my alarm clock rang i had my laptop next to me so i kept slamming the screen opening and closing thinking it was the alarm clock which ended up cracking part of the screen  
hello Im new on this forum, recently I have had a really bad phase in my life starting with a massive panic attack which started my insomnia. This lasted for three weeks now and i feel worse everyday. bone loss and muscle loss are one of the consequences not to mention anhedonia lack of concnetration and bad memory. I believe my obssesive thinking has led to all of this but I cant shake it off and i feel like my cortisol levels are at an all time high. I dont sweat properly anymore and I feel like the living dead. Could i be a thyroid problem that isn't letting me relax and sleep at night? I'm in my early 20's and don't want to die this way, I just want to get better but I get worse by the hour.  I tried every sleeping pill under the sun but it doesn't seem to have any effect on me anymore, I don't even get any side effects i.e. headaches drowsiness or aches.  
if I get startled while falling asleep (only at that point - not being woken up from deep sleep), that's it for the night whether the time is 2 am or 6 am. Last night I went to the bathroom around 3, went back to bed, falling asleep and the cat jumped on my legs. I get incredibly startled and there is NO way I can go back to sleep for the rest of the night. Like I said this only happens when the startling incident happens at a very specific stage of falling asleep. Extremely annoying. There is no reason for such a degree of anxiety yet there it is 
Hello insomnia forum. I just found this because I can't cope anymore. I can't sleep. I've tried a lot. Kirkland sleep aid - was tripling the dose, taking it about 8pm and falling asleep around 10:30, worked for a few weeks untill i guess I built up a tolerance. Tried using blue light filter glasses a few hours before bed time, no luck. Tried all sorts of exercise/not exercising and at different times, nothing worked there. Tried sleep meditation/hypnosis videos and audio tracks before/while trying to sleep, did nothing. Also tried white noise, nature sounds but didn't do anything. took melatonin for 3/4 weeks didn't do anything. I also have ADHD, I take Ritalin for it, but wears off around 8pm, and I have had insomnia waaay longer than Ive been taking Ritalin. Also I've gone weeks in the holidays without it and still not slept sufficiently. I don't know what to do. Has anyone got a bloody solution?  Thanks!  
Hello, I'm a twenty two year old female who has been suffering with anxiety and depression for over 6 years. It causes me to have depersonalization and derealization and now feeling overly exhausted 24/7. This has happened to me twice now that I will be laying down and I'll close my eyes and supposedly I fell asleep and then when my parents call for me I wake up and feel I went unconscious because I didn't dream or anything. It feels like I was in a coma for about 30 minutes. The first time it lasted for about 10 minutes. My dad says its because I'm so stressed and sleep deprived. I don't drop to the ground because I'm so tired I just feel so tired 24/7 and zoned out and forgetful. I'm a healthy person with no medical background. I have been taking Lexapro for 5 days now on 5 mg. but I don't think this is the case since this sleeping episode happened a month ago before I was on it. I hope it's just because I'm sleep deprived and have so much stress going on. I get so much sleep though too that's the problem but have been getting up at 7 am and going to bed at 10. Please help 
not sure if spelling is  right. but just wondering does anyone suffer from sleep paralysis,or know anything about it. 
Hi,  My husband weight is 90 kg. He snore very loud at night. So, reduce weight will prove helpful to him? 
Sometimes during sleep , I have this condition where I can use all my senses other than my eyes. During this condition , I'm usually having a very bad / scary nightmare and usually I just wake up when I'm having nightmares. But sometimes , I don't wake up completely. I am able to talk and scream , I can hear other people around me talking and hear myself screaming , I can feel if someone touches me but regardless however hard I try , I can't open my eyes. So all I can do is scream and scream but cant open my eyes.  Does this happen to anyone else ? Should I be worried ?

Hello, I am a 20 year old female and twice over the past couple of months I have had quite a fright. One evening I got home from work and went for a power nap as I was so tired. I woke up about an hour later and looked at the time and realised that I was going to be late for meeting some friends so I jumped in the shower. After getting out of the shower I started to get dressed but all of a sudden felt odd and couldn't remember anything - I didn't even remember having a shower and couldn't process my brain to find a matching pair of socks! This then triggered a panic attack as I remembered long term i.e. my address and who was around me but I couldn't remember anything that had happened that day. I called NHS Direct and after speaking to someone I felt calmer after about 15 minutes. I had never had a previous history of panic attacks - this was my first one and since then I have had a few. The same thing happened today. I went for a power nap after work and was woken up by someone to let me know I needed to wake for dinner. I walked into a different room and again felt so disorientated and I didn't recognise anything in the room I was in. Both times this has happened it was when I was sleeping in the day time for less than 2 hours. This has never happened when my alarm has gone off in the morning. Has anyone else had this before and does anyone know a cause/prevention?  I have also had sleep paralysis before where I've woken up and I can see my room with my eyes half open but I can't fully open my eyes, can't move at all and felt like someone was holding something over my mouth because I was struggling trying to breathe. Again, has anyone had this before? Do we know what causes it?  Over the past few months I have felt under a lot of pressue with work and I am very stressed. I do not have trouble sleeping - when sleeping at night I don't tend to wake up until my alarm in the morning with no problems. Thanks in advance! 
Hey guys I'm new to this forum but I wanting to seek help and advice to somewhat calm my thoughts and hopefully find a resolution. I never had a sleeping problem, ever. Then one day I felt a little ill for two days and went to the ER where they just found I was dehydrated and low off potassium. I thought I was ok after that but the the next day I was feeling sick again and threw up (I think it was my nerves) and I ended up having a panick attack and had the EMT come thinking it was a heart attack. I wound up at the doctors and being diagnosed with and anxiety and give lorazepam to calm them. I took those pills daily (.5 mg) up to three times but split in 4's (so 3 1/4 tablets a day) I mostly used it during the evening as I noticed my anxiety heightened somewhat. But after two weeks I decided to stop on my own because I heard of the addiction. Well three days after going through shakes and weakness my life changed. Aug 23 was the first day I had insomnia and it's going on now. I literally can't sleep no matter how physically and mentally tired I am. I've gone 2-3 days/nights a time where I don't sleep at all and when I do sleep it's because I took medication. And even then I'll wake up a few times. I'm so scared of this killing me, I'm 29, married, with two beautiful girls and I can't imagine not being around for them. I'm so scare because it's so new to me and I just want this to go away. I was prescribed hydroxyzine and it gave me this horrible rush over my face before I fell asleep and then had vibe dream, I still woke up about every hour. Now I mm prescribe trazadone and I'm scared to take it because it's an antidepressant and I don't know how it's going to react with me. Last night was the first night I slept in 36 hours because I took a lorazepam(I still have some left) I woke up twice but still feel tired of course from losing sleep the previous day's. I do t know what's goi g on by I'm terrified. I tried melatonin and nighty nighty yea as a natural remedy which made me sleepy but not enough to fall asleep. I want me life back and I try to have faith in my God but I can't help but to feel scared of the future 
I would really wish from you guys to share your stories of how you manage your insomnia or how you got over it  thank you. 
The last few nights, just before I'm about to fall asleep I wake up, jolt out bed and my heart is racing, I feel a little light headed, I feel disoriented/confused, hand tingling and slight tremor,  my breathing is shaking (assume this is caused by a chest tremor) and internal head vibrations (these have been going on for awhile which I attribute to sleep deprivation).  This all lasts for a minute or so. After calming down a little I checked my blood pressure and it was high (140) with a pulse of 70. I'm a 34 male in overall good health, but I have been dealing with chronic insomnia, fatigue and very low testosterone for nine months.  The wake ups before falling asleep are new. They aren't panic attacks because I don't feel entirely conscious when it happens. It's like I'm about to doze off and some need to jump out of bed. It's like a flight or fight reaction that happens automatically. It started while on Silenor, but last night I stopped taking it and I still experienced the symptoms described above. It's takes me an hour or so to get back to sleep after these events.   Has anyone else experienced this and know the cause? It's quite freaky. For a moment of feel like I'm dying. I read somewhere that waking up before entering deep sleep could cause this. 
I've had a problem with going to sleep where while i'm falling asleep, I suddenly feel some sort of electric shock go through my entire body and then I won't be able to move unless I force myself to. I can't tell if this happens during a dream or not, but its very strange and confuses me. This has happened on three occasions, once a year ago, once a few nights ago. I even heard really creepy music in my head that time and again today.   Also, this morning I woke up at 7am. I tried to go back to sleep but whenever I tried to fall asleep it was as if my mind started to "skip thoughts" and I felt incredibly weird.  â  What could cause this? 
Recently I have been seeing and hearing things. Last night I felt something pressing my hand, I opened my eyes, and I saw a wisp of blackish-grey smoke and something that I think resembled a hand. I wasn't scared becuase it's happened before. But this time it came with a deep graoning sound. It scared to living hell out of me. It lasted for about 5 seconds.  I don't believe in the supernatural, but I could really use an explanantion.  
I started this drug last night.  I'm not sure about it.  But, I think I always get anxiety when I start new drugs (not knowing what they will do to me).  My typical sleep pattern is:  Bed at 12:30...up at 1:30, 2:30, 3:30, 5:30, 6:30, 7, & 7:30 up for good.  Last night with Ramelton:  Bed at 12:00, up at 2:30, 5:30....AND THEN 8:30 for good. So I guess it is working.  But, I did take 1/2 of doxylamine (over the counter sleep aide) with it at around 12:30 because i wasn't sleeping and I had taken Ramelton at 11:20.  I will post about tonights sleep...cause if it works...it is a safe drug...not a benzo (but it is considered a sedative)....and it can be taken for long periods of time.  And...it may help others like it appears it may be helping me. 
I have been taking Silenor (5 mg) for sleep the last several days. It has been helpful, but last night after 30 minutes of going to bed, I was starting to fall asleep or felt like I was in this state of being almost asleep and half awake, then I suddenly became fully awake, and felt confuse and disoriented. I decided to get up and noticed my heart rate starting to increase. I tried to ignore, but it contiuned to increase and then finally stay there. My hands also started to shake a little. I was not having a panic attack. I rode it out and eventually my heart rate went back to normal. I think I was having some kind of reaction to the sleeping aid. Has anyone had this experience on a sleep aid? Did I take too much or too little? I'm thinking that while on the sleep aid my body was reacting because I was suppose to be asleep. I wonder what caused to fully awake.   
Hello , I am new to this forum   As many of you here im struggling to get some sleep duo to anxiety for some days now and its making me depressed �  I think it all started when i was 11 years old on holiday , when i went to sleep and had a panic attack out of nowhere , and my parents had to sent me to hospital , since then i always had anxiety and panic attacks prior sleeping , some nights couldnt sleep until 6 am some nights  but in general i would still be able to sleep . Two years ago duo to some differences in my lifestyle ,depression and anxiety hit me the worst i couldnt function i started having intrusive thoughts   I couldnt sleep at all until i decided to go to the doctor a psychiatrist who prescribed me escitalopram, 10 mg and i only used it for a month or two , but it helped me tremendously then i quit taking it on my own and doctor wasnt satisfied with my decision and since then i have done it several times , its been almost a year since i havent used it , since the last time i used it was to get some relief because i couldnt sleep at all. But let me just say that eventhough it helped me a lot probably the withdrawal effects had a huge impact on my short memory , prior to use a medications i was quit sharp , but i feel like anxiety is part of my life but the thing that concerns me the most is sleep , my biggest fear is to not be able to sleep on my own i dont want to take sleeping pills because i know that insomnia is not a disease its a symptom but how can i manage to do it  , im trying to change my diet but havent seen any improvement yet and i know it takes time i don't exercise a lot im taking different vitamins like b6 vitamin d  before sleeping milk with manuka honey .please help me any suggestions you have i would appreciate it  .  P.s i live in a country where the health care and medicine are at worst! Sorry for this long story

I took a sleep aid the other night and woke up an hour into it a little shortness of breath, heart pounding and slightly rapid. Has anyone had this experience while on a sleep aid? I'm curious what caused me to wake up. Could it be sleep apnea? I also wake up with my heart pounding (not fast) in the late morning.  
I've had sleeping issues since I was 14 years old (26 now). I've been on countless medications and a C-Pap machine and nothing had been truly effective. My biggest trouble was actually falling asleep, but now that's the easiest part. It has definitely got better over the years but for the past 2 weeks I've been waking up at 4:45-5 every morning. I feel so tired and I try to go back to sleep but I usually just lay there until 6:30-7. I rarely go back to sleep and sometimes I don't even know if I actually fall back asleep because it's so hard to.  Some things that I've done is got rid of my alarm clock so I wouldn't keep checking it every 2 minutes. I also covered my windows so my room is almost pitch black because the sun peeking through used to wake me up. When I wake up I usually reach for my phone or ipod (both turned off) and turn one on to check the time (I know that's probably a stupid idea but how else will I know what time it is?). When I get up for good I usually head to the bathroom and look at the alarm clock in the spare bedroom when I walk past it.  This is really starting to catch up to me. I don't have nearly as much energy as usual. I have no motivation to get anything done. I just want to be able to get a full nights sleep in because I rarely have had that in the past 12 years.  If anyone has any suggestions about what I can do to get out of this habit I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.

I have had this problem for 2 years where when I try to sleep my heart beats faster and I feel I don't go into the deep stage of sleep.all through the night my mind is going over the things I do during the day I am asleep but my mind does not switch off  
Hi folks. Yesterday I was prescribed Ami as am suffering from anxiety in the mornings. I took 10mg last night at about 9.30pm & just didn't get any good sleep at all. I feel like a zombie today. How can something prescribed to help with sleep do this. Feeling very frustrated. Going to go back to taking nothing at all at night and just suffer the anxiety. Anti depressants also make my insomnia worse. Any advice anyone? Many thanks x  
Hi all,  I'm 27 and I've had insomnia since February (stress and work related) and surviving on an average of 4 hours a night.  I was very very sleep deprived - my cognitive function was low as was my mood! I tried everything from relaxtion, meditation, sleep hygiene and nothing worked to start. Now I have started taking a magnesium and calcium supplement and it has basically cured my sleeping problems. I sleep for 7-8 hours a night with waking only once and with that I fall straight back asleep. My question is: Would the body go through a re-adjustment period? I've only had 4 nights of this amazing sleep but I feel jetlagged. Not like hungover as one would be with sleeping tablets but just like I haven't gotten enough sleep. Would my body have just got used to this 4 hours a night and now adjusting to such a peaceful sleep?  
hi, ive been researching online and have found some tips but i just wanted to know some tips that were more personal to my routine. iv heard online that you shouldnt sleep on your left side. is this true? iv been pretty depressed since the start of the year (sometimes suicidal, used to be everyday) but im getting a little better. after school i usually stay on my bed until about 8pm then i watch a movie on the floor haha. it helps a bit. then i go to bed at around 10pm and go to sleep around 12 and wake up at around 6am even though my alarm is set on 7am. am i staying on my bed too much? i usuallly dont do more intense workout before sleep however i do 120 situps and 40 pushups just to make my body tired. i feel like it helps. i frequently feel tired at school and it effects my schooling and social life. i was just wondering what you guys think could improve my sleep. sorry this was so long. thanks  
I'm at my wits end. I've had sleeping problems before but this is different. I'm scared to death I have Fatal Insomnia! I've always made it on 5-6 hours a night and been fine. The last few nights have been hell. My anxiety has been rearing is ugly head. As I begin to doze I feel weird sensations. My heart pounds, I feel short of breath, and I feel as if I'll vomit. It all jolts me awake. I've gotten maybe 7 hours total the last 2 nights and I'm scared.  I do have other symptoms as well.  Horrible Insomnia Sweating and chills  Heart pounding Depression and anxiety Also when I do achieve sleep, I feel as if I don't and have vivid dreams. I'm almost dreaming with my eyes open. I'm never aware I'm asleep, done it for years. My job requires a ton of thinking and my anxiety is fine until the moment I get home and begin to wind down. I think I've developed a fear of sleep or sleep dread.  I just can't shake the feeling that I really have Fatal Insomnia. Any reassurance will help please?  
Hello, I suffer from DSPD (Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder) for a period of 4 years (my entire adulthood). Only recently I have been diagnosed.  The thing I wanted to ask about is a strange symptom that my doctor couldn't identify.  Almost every single day at 4 o'clock in the afternoon (this changes depending on my sleeping pattern, which is largely abnormal because of DSPD) I experience debiliating states of exhaustion and derealisation. There is no additional drowsiness and I fail to fail asleep most of the times this happens. My doctor said this is not something typical for DSPD, referred me to a psychiatrist but so far nothing came from it.  During this state I experience: - Strong feeling of being an observer, watching myself from 3rd preson (derealisation) - Muscle pain and extreme fatigue without drowsiness - Inability to focus on most trivial things - Slight coordination loss (if I have to walk I tend to bump into objects constantly)  This is a great problem, perhaps bigger than DSPD itself. I am unable to hold a conversation, I tend to be irritable and have an urge to avoid contact with others. I have no choice but to withdraw quickly from any activity I might be doing (nowadays I plan my day around this).  This state dissipates within 1 to 2 hours. It happens almost every day at 4 pm (sudden sleep pattern changes alter the time it occurs).  I have no medical history other than DSPD and OCD (which I no longer suffer from thanks to succesful therapy) and take no medications.  This has been going for almost a year now with no explanation and nothing to help. As you can imagine I am quite desperate.  Anyone experiences anything similar? Perhaps any doctor here has encountered a symptom like this? 
Hey guys any help will be appreciated. I will start from the beginning to give an overview. Excuse my grammer i have  gotten any sleep since April. Also I am very sorry for the long story just want to give everyone a better understanding. Thank you for your patience.    So back in 2011 I was self employed at the age of 19, i was doing really good for my age. I was in a sometimes stressful environment seeing as I ran my company myself. I started getting weird pains. in My stomach, muscle spasms and all kind of things I thought something was wrong with me. I went to doctors did tests and different scans they all found nothing. But I was convinced it was something because pain could t just come out of no where. I ended up having to close my business because it got so bad I was always worrying bout it and thought I was going  to die. I did research online and found out there was a condition where people think k they have a disease but don't. I later found out about cbd which is used to aniexty. I drove to Denver got it and instantly my aniexty was gone. Good right ? . I completely forgot about all those things I was worried about and moved on wit life.   2015 I decided to go back to school and get my associate it 1year so I was taking g 5 classes a semester but I noticed in Feb of 2015 one night literally felt like someone dimmed the light it my brain after that I noticed I could not sleep. Months went by I was using melatonin for sleep it was helping but I would feel groggy and hung over. I keep uping my dose to bout 10mg it stopped working my August mind you I am still taking 5 classes each semester.     In August I got a job in the IT field while I was still in school sleep was still crappy I didnt think nothing of it because I know many people who work full time w school and still make it so I thought if they can do it so can I. My job required alot of walking and I noticed my leg was aching from Fatigue but once again I said whatever take it like a champ. Now I think the fatigue was nothing if I was getting good restorative sleep but the fact was I wasn't getting this with all the work and school I was doing but at the time I wasnt thinking about that I was too focused on what I need to do.   ((((I would take Xanax sometimes when I was stressed out and into 2016 i would take .25 or .5  or 1mg and it would knock me out but never consecutively and not more than 30 pills stressed out in months))    I was so tired and exhausted that sometime around December of 2015 I said forget all this gave up on school and work and for a whole week I sleep without pills or anything. I noticed that 1week of sleep was enough to rejuvenate my legs I felt no pain and was overall in a good state. After that 1 week I had to get back to work as I graduated Dec of 15.   I graduated and also got a better job while I had my other one work both for a month and dropped one by Jan of 2016. Kept working 45 hour weeks and found it difficult to sleep as I was stressed out at work and was studying for a certification exam. I occasionally took Xanax just to knock my out when I had difficulty sleeping but noticed I didnt feel restored when I woke up. I then went to a doc in Feb of 2016 I was giving amtrililin or something like that it made me feel terrible nausea and headache then I was giving trazodone it helped me sleep but had same side effects. I didn't take both at the same time fyi but discontinued them.  Fast forward to April I endured the fatigue in My legs and lack of sleep only because I had bills/responsibilities and had a goal to reach. I talked to co workers and they said might be your mattress causing all this and I went ahead and bought a new one around April 24 and surprisingly I slept for 3 days but once gain I think stress at work and studying ending that.  So after those 3 days I went right back to not being about to sleep due to racing  mind.  After April my sleep was literally non existent by the  of may I think my body had taken all it would because around June 3rd amd 4th it became impossible for me to.procoess thought and do my job duties. I was a lead tech for a big company and I had a lot of responsibilities.  O. The 3rd a mistake I did was take yellow Xanax for sleep and I had less than 5-6 to wake up for work. When I got up I felt foggy brain. And just terrible. By the time i got to work my legs were dead I think my leg fatigue had reached its limit because I could barely walk. I ended up leaving  early  and that night when I got home just the thought of me having to go to work give me a mini panic attack which I never had before.  ( Never had a panic attack) . Someone had to calm me down, I went to work next day but I could only stay for 2 hours I ended up quitting  that day my mind and body couldnt take it.    I felt good quitting my goal was to get as much sleep as possible to heal my body and mind  ( sounds easy right ). The whole month of June I did not get a lick of sleep. After I dropped every stressor In my life i still could t sleep I was so confused. When you lay In Bed tossing and turning due to lack of sleep you start goggling and trying to find disgnosis a d treatments. As you guessed my aniexty and fatigue shot through the roof. I have become unable to walk, I mean I can walk my legs are just extremely fatigued and in pain.   In July I had 2more panic attacks biggest one was while driving I thought it was a heart attack. I decided to make another trip to Denver and see if cbd would help. I tried cbd CBN medicinal weed for insomnia none worked like they did before. Well when I smoke I feel like I am about to sleep but when I get that falling feeling my heart starts beating fast as hell and it wakes me back up.fast forward to August I have this crawling feeling in my chest (heart) and arm I am scared due to lack of sleep I might get heart failure. I would be happy if I can Just get even 30 mins or an 1hr.  Guys I don't know what else to do I have a sleep study on the 20th.  The problem is when I lay down to sleep my brain doesn't turn off aka my mind hasnt rested in months.   I get night sweats  Exhausted all times of the day  Extremely fatigued Little depressed  Aniexty    I know all these things will go away when I sleep but I do t know how to get there.   Here are the things I have tried   Melatonin  GABA  Magnesium liquid  OTC sleep aids  Benadryl  Advil pm  Marijuana  aroma therapy Massage  Acupuncture Vitamin b complex Cbd Cbn  I don't believe I have any illness because I sleep those times and everything went away I just need to get my sleep back.   Thanks in advance.  
I am expecting to be diagnosed with sleep apnoea (they are doing one more test to confirm it). âI am told that I will then be given a CPAP machine. âI have seen these and find the prospect of trying to use (sleep) with a face mask and rigid tube connecting to a machine, quite daunting. Can anyone offer any reassuring guideance on managing this or even maybe confirm my worst fears! âNigel  
I'm back and I have some serious questions about my sleeping issues. On this forum a few nights ago I posted about my fear of Fatal Insomnia. While this fear is still going strong I have some serious questions about my issues.  I've had Insomnia before but this is different. Im suddenly getting to where I can't sleep at all some nights. I've gone from 6-7 hours to 2-3 hours a night very suddenly. Is this normal for Insomnia?  Has anybody ever felt as if you're not sleeping because your brain never fully shuts down? Does anyone suffer from sleep dread/phobia? Finally is anyone suffering from sleep state misperception?  
Hi all,         Having only an hour of sleep for entire day. Even though had an hour of sleep i feel healthy and Happy. This condition eating me...is it a problem or not.. 
I find it extremely difficult to fall asleep, even when i do i find it hard to stay asleep to the point where i only get a maximum of 2 hours. Ive come of my antidepressants because theyre making me worse but ive struggled with this for half a year. Ive tried relaxing techniques e.g. candles, reading, turning phone and tv off, hot milk, herbal sleep aids, stress relief tablets etc but nothing is working. Ive got a new job (that isnt stressing me out) but i have to call in sick a lot because im so drained that i can barely concentrate. I get bad headaches alongside it. Its gotten so bad i try to take strong painkillers to see if they knock me out  ive been to the GP but they didnt do nothing but give me a weeks worth months back. Ive spoken to a NHS nurse and they told me to see my GP and explain again to them. My GP doesnt listen so i dont know what else i can do.. im so fed up.. its making me more depressed. 
Hi Everyone, Hope that you are doing well. I just want some expert opinion about remeron and clonezapam. I was using clonezapam previously for almost 2 years and was taking it 2,3 times a week mostly on weekends with 1mg dosage.(the medicine didn't give me more than 6 hours of sleep) I was fine at that time and quite satisfied because at least 2 or 3 times in a week i have my natural sleep. But from last sixth months i am very upset regarding my sleep pattern. My natutral sleep was gone and even clonzepam is not working( As it was working before). I consulted one doctor, initially he given me seroquel i tried it for almost 1 month but it was also not worth it.. Then he shifted me to Remmeron 15 mg one dose at night time, with an SSRI (Xeroxat, i didn't used it because only two days of usage starts giving me side effects). But i continued to use Remmeron. Remmeron is quite better but when i take it my body getting jerks from time to time like for every after 15 minutes i got jerk(my wife really afraid of me these days ).Some days in a week (mostly on weekends) i got some uninterrputed sleep for 5,6 hours. but some days i won't(May be 2,3 hours of sleep). My job is badly effected. In the lunch break i take a nap of 1 hour just to make sure that my rest of day goes well. I am thinking of taking clonezepam 1mg with remmeron 15mg before bed just to give it a shot. Please guide me should i do it? or any other option. I don't want to take SSRI as the have adverse side effects( for me Sexual Dysfunctino is more often). Any single word of help will be appreciated. Thanks   
6 weeks ago I had a panic attack, ever since then I have pretty much completely lost the ability to sleep, my head is so numb and I feel high pressure and tension in my head all the time, feels like my head is swelling from no sleep my memory is so bad now like I mean really bad and it keeps getting worse and worse Iv'e done a lot of research on sleep and apparently it's necessary for the brain to repair, I just feel like an empty vesile now, nothing works sleeping tablets, anxiety tablets, you name it Iv'e been prescribed and tried it all, doctors just tell me it's anxiety making me think I'm loosing my memory but I just know their is something wrong I feel like I have demantia, I am just never tired, to be honest I don't know how I'm alive still, I have almost completely lost the ability to imaginative, and I am almost certain if they did a CT scan on my brain it would show brain damage, I know most of you probably won't believe me, I'm at my witts end now I can't concentrate on even the most basic tasks now, another thing is I feel like my immune system has been affected, for example I have grazed my arm twice since the not sleeping started and both the grazes have turned to scars, I know this is not normal especially for me, please help me if you can, I'm really desperate now, and not sure how much longer I can go on like this, please help, thanks a lot, I know Iv'e alreay poseted a similar story, but I'm just so scared and desperate now, by the way every symptom of sleep deprivation I have, such as not healing (weakened amune system), losing my memory, etc, the scariest symptom if not healing properly, because it's so obvious and clear  
Hi all. I seem to be suffering with anxiety first thing in the morning even if I've managed to get a reasonable amount of sleep. I do wake in the night a few times and manage to get off to sleep again providing I have nothing worrying me e.g something happening the next day that I'm nervous about. I'm reluctant to start taking sleep meds again as I feel they only mask the problem. But I feel like I'm cornered. Help anyone, your advice will be greatly appreciated.  
Hey. Im gonna be straightforward with this one because I dont want to share a very long, weird story about my family. Lol. So basically my dad, who's 55yrs old works for a cleaning company at this time and his schedule is pretty whack for him. He works for only 4 hours and 30 mins. That's from 3am to 7:30am. And my mom doesnt seem to want to let him sleep on her bed that's supposed to be theirs. Yup pretty weird right? But the problem is, my dad is having a difficult time to get sleep by the time he is home. He sleeps in my room and on the floor. And I find it difficult now to move around and do stuff since he's there and I dont want to wake him but I dont really do important things because its my vacation. So like everytime he's sleeping I gotta be a ninja. I just dont want to tell him to sleep somewhere else because might get him depressed (i think he's basically depressed but just hiding it, ugh). But when he sleep, it seems to be very light because even though I'd be the best ninja as I can, he would still wake up and then have a hard time to sleep. Heck I probably wake him up by just breathing! I know the place to sleep might be a factor of his sleeping problems but he just tells me thats really how he is with his age, which I don't really know If it's true. I even told him to go see a doctor but I don't think he will. Still gonna try to convince him. I just want to know things from you guys for now on what he must do to get at least a good sleep. Maybe quit the job and get one that would be good for him? Pretty hard to find a job as an immigrant(plus old age) sheesh. Well thanks for reading! Hope you guys have something to say.  Ps. He snores occasionally too and Im pretty sure thats one thing that messes with his sleep 
For the last 5 weeks I have barely slept and really want to know how much I am actually sleeping so I really want to go to a sleep clinc so I can get my sleep monitored I live in the UK England, and am having a real struggle finding a sleep clinic I would greatly appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction ?  
For the last two weeks I have been waking up between 3 and 4 am with an overwhelming amount of energy which has made it impossible to fall back asleep for about an hour. It feels like a tightness in my back and I am often so energized that it is uncomfortable to stay in bed and I find myself getting up and walking around or sitting in a chair shaking my legs and arms as if I need to run a marathon to rid myself of this energy. I often find myself shaking the energy off for 1-2 hours   I had shoulder surgery almost two months ago and have changed my diet as a result of my more sedentary recovery ( I am 22 year old college rugby athlete). I have reduced my calorie intake and reduced caffiene fat, carbohydrates, and sugar consumption.   I have tried reintroducing some calories and fats during these hours and before going to bed, because I have read that it may be a response to low blood sugar but have not seen an improvement thus far. I have also tried using a sleeping medications before bed and during the insomnia episode. Both have yet to yield results.  Does anyone have any information as to what is causing these dramatic energy episodes and how they can be alleviated?  
Mine was horrible. I sometimes went 3 days with no sleep and thought I was losing my mind. If I did get any sleep, it was maybe 3 hours a night max and then I kept waking up. Grandson mentioned 2 days ago that maybe I needed to exercise more and get fresh air, so I researched it and he was right! I am sedentary most of the time, on the computer working. My lymph nodes, our  body's garbage disposal, was plugged up and it affected my brain and caused insomnia. Just 2 days of walking, stair stepping and fresh air and my God, I am sleeping! Here is some info we all need to know!  The lymph system needs to be worked. It is the sewage system for cellular metabolic toxins. Lymph nodes provide antigens for purifying fluids containing anything from allergens to cancer cells. That fluid is called lymph. There is more lymph in your body than blood, but there is no pump for lymph.  If lymph doesn't move out of small lymph nodes through their ducts into the kidneys and liver, it backs up like a clogged sewer line. Lymph nodes can become infected and you wind up with "swollen glands," a misnomer. Lymph nodes are not glands.  The lymph nodes drain via physical activity, such as walking briskly, not slowly. Itâs through your lymph system that your body is able to remove all the built-up wastes, toxins, and any other elements that are not needed by other systems in your body.  Those who have proper lymphatic drainage tend to rid this waste quickly and efficiently, which then means they tend to feel their best on a day to day basis.  Those who donât drain this system properly, well, you can likely imagine how they feel.  Think about it this way.  What would happen if you didnât clean your house for an entire year?  Or, letâs say you didnât take out the garbage for one monthâs time.  The garbage man never came and instead, that trash piled up inside your garage (or on the corner of your lot).  After the time has passed, what would that look like?  It would be quite the sight to see.  The same applies for your body. If you are not experiencing proper lymphatic drainage, these toxins will build up in the body and soon, theyâll be impacting every other system you have.  Your organs will be impacted, your heart will be impacted, even your brain may start to be influenced by all this toxic waste disabling its sleep signals, causing insomnia. 
Can anyone help?I am having dreadful problems with getting off to sleeo at night.Some nights I am still awake at two in the morning,when I do drop off I wake up after having the most violent dreams.I really do not want to go on sleeping pills but don not know what else to do. 
My insomnia has gotten progressively worse weekly. I have gone four nights with no sleep at all and mind still doesn't stop. When it finally stopped last night with trazodone i still only got  four hours. . I just hardly ever get sleepy. I have been using a cocktail of 10mg Ambien, 100 mg trazodone, kava, and even belsomra every four days to avoid building tolerance, while I also use a cocktail of 7.5 mg remeron, 50 mg seroquel, kava every four days as well. The other days I will just go without meds so that these can continue working. I am very nervous that they will stop working but at the same time when I don't sleep the whole night, I find my anxiety rises even more...making insomnia worse....I know I cannot sleep a wink without these meds. these cocktails get me about 5 hours on a good night. Does anyone feel that starting antidepressants will stop my anxiety? I am afraid of taking the sedating antidepressants every day because then i might lose the effectiveness of the antihistamine effect. While i am afraid of using SSRIs because they have a side effect of insomnia. Since i couldn't even sleep a wink in four nights, i am not sure how i could go about with sleep restriction. My life is stressfree otherwise...I only worry about my insomnia and my future..becoming brain dead slowly or something. I drink no coffee, alcohol and i exercise daily. 
Hello I have been suffering from insomnia now for 6 months, after an acute stress reaction back in January. I became very depressed, although that is getting better week by week. I have never suffered with this before. The doc tried me on some anti depression meds, which had little effect so I tapered off them. He also gave me a low dose of quetiepine to help sleep, which made me feel very weird the next day. Another doc gave me lorazepam, which is the only med which gives me a good nights sleep. Sometimes I will take 1mg, or I will cut it in half. I wake up feeling normal and functional, but I don't want to get dependant on it. I don't crave it at all in the day, just like it to get me to sleep. Does anyone have any suggestions? 
Hi,  I've been struggling with anxiety, depression, overeating and I am currently on a variation of medication: - Prozac - Beta blockers (not daily) - Mefenamic Acid - Mini Pill - Iron Tablets  For the past, I'd say a decade, I've struggled with nightmares. But over the past six months, they've got unbearable. Every single night I have confusing, real feeling, overwhelming nightmares/dreams.   I always always feel tired, I mean like I can't stay awake at work and nap through the day. I seem to sleep better, without nightmares (or not ones I remember) in the day, to what I do on a  night.  It's ruining my life, I'm tired all the time. I'm too anxious to sleep.  What's wrong with me? Please help??  I'm too scared to talk to the doctor because I have to go already there for my PCOS, Ovarian Polyps, General Anxiety & Depression. I don't to add more to the list and them to think I'm stupid/silly. 
does anyone take temazepam  
I have recently stopped taking B12 & B6 as I believed they caused me to have anxiety. I took them first thing in the morning and the anxiety would last until midday-ish. I'm so confused.... Since I stopped I felt less anxious in the morning but so very tired as my sleep problems have retuned (waking every 2 hours). There is lots of information that states b vits help with sleep issues, so I've decided to start taking them again. I take Valerian sometimes too. I'm feeling like this whole sleep thing is too complex for me. Anyone else take B vits for sleep - does it help you?  
Ive been like this for 2 weeks now. I am so tired but I cant sleep. If I fell asleep the sleep I got is just like 3 hours and then stay awake till morning. Also this has been happening a lot to me, everytime I was about to fall asleep my body jerks. Sometimes my left hand sometimes my feet. I dont know. Im just so tired right now. Im getting crazy abou this. Please someone help? 
So I haven't slept in 2 nights, I just came off holidays, where I was gaming till early hours in the morning (2-5am) and waking at around 11-3pm. I am started back to school after te holidays yesterday but didn't go to school as I had no sleep that night. This is now my Second night with no sleep and i don't feel really tired just slighty fatigued.  I have tried everything: Music (loud quite, calming, not calming.) Watching YouTube, a Moive or TV while laying down trying to close my eyes. I have tried things like 2 or more hours just lying there breathing techniques and such with my eyes closed.  Im getting kind of scared of what could happen without sleep. Should I see my doctor about sleeping pills or try another night to get some sleep? 
Does anyone have experience of using these magnetic devices.  According to the adverts they are the anwer to insomnia, but they are very expensive and I would like to know if they work! 
I have just been recently diagnosed with sleep apnea and now have to get a C-Pap machine.  Is there one that is better and more comfortable than another???   I don't know anything about them so any help or advice would be "Greatly Appreciated".

Hi last night I had sleep paralaysi, I get it often but its getting worse.  I felll asleep but then I felt someone holding me tight from behind, I couldn't move or talk, I felt him breathing on the back of my neck, every time I tried to move my body wouldn't allow me  I tried shouting but I couldn't talk.  All i could feel was a body behind me and warm breath on the back of my neck.  As I started to wake an image flew at me screaming from the wall.  My son ran in and I was screaming, my son said I'd been crying out for a cpl minutes.  This really scared me I couldn't go back to sleep and I've been thinking about it all day I'm dreading going to sleep tonight.   
I've had this problem for 2 years now I take zolpidem and ace no problem getting to sleep usually but awake every morning around 4am and am unable to get back to sleep why is this happening to me  
I've been having sleep problems as far back as I can remember.  About 8 years ago I was having terrible RLS, it took about 4 years to finally find a doctor able to control it.  I still have bad nights, however, much better.  Now that my RLS has improved, I'm sleeping much better.  Unfortunately, I'm still having insomnia, I wake several times during the night and I have awful daytime fatigue (even after having a great night of sleep).  It is effecting my life in so manyways.  I am unable to drive long distances or even work full time because of my extreme fatigue.  There have been times that I have been driving and at a red light will nod off, luckily I catch myself and fight to stay awake.  It's really scary!  I only drive when absolutely necessary.  At family get togethers, there are times that I'll be talking to someone and fighting not to fall asleep in the middle ofa conversation.  Usually the person I'm speaking to will comment...Are you ok, your eyes look like they're half shut and sometimes I'll start talking about something totally irrelevant to what the conversation is about.  I also have had times during the day at home that I'll nod off and in those few minutes I'll have a dream and wake and start talking to whomever it was about like it actually happened (if that makes any sense, lol), it's very strange!  I've also had times when I was sitting up eating and I fell asleep and woke with my head in my food, lol.  Not funny, it's scary and embarrassing!  I've had sleep studies in the past which showed, abnormal sleep structure, frequent awakenings, RLS and no REM sleep.  IT seems like Narcolepsy to me, but from everything that I have read, people with Narcolepsy usually have increased REM?  Is it possible to have Narcolepsy and no REM???  Sorry for rambling on, thanks for reading!!!  If anyone has any advice or similar stories, I would be extremely appreciative!!!!  I'm so tired of living like this!  THANKS SO MUCH!!! 
sometimes when i fall asleep i feel awake but i cant move any of my body parts and they stay sized or paralised i cant even speak even if i can speak my voice will not come out. sometimes i also sleep with my friends and this problem happened again i can see him looking at me and i was aking for help but i cant say any expcet to watch him and move my eyes my friend thought i was awake and staying put or quiet but it was not that please tell me what is happening to me? 
Does anyone have any ideas for getting back to a deep sleep after nightime wake up call to the loo?  I fall asleep fine but when I need to get up at say 3 am, (in the dark) and use the loo, when i return to the bed, sleep evades me.  I just lay there until the alarm goes off.  Can't keep doing this and expect to function normally.  
Hi all.  For months I was taking 100mg of 5 htp before bed and my sleep was dreadful. I then went about 3 wks without taking it and my sleep improved massively... It was life changing for me. Howevever, I did start to feel low and anxious in the day. So I have been taking 100 mg of 5 htp first thing in the morning to try and raise my serotonin again. Last night I had the worst night sleep again and wondering if it's the 5 htp causing havoc. Has anyone else used 5 htp, morning or night? Thanks in advance xx 
I've had this unusal problem just recently. My face would get hot for no apparent reason at night when I'm trying to get back to sleep. I'll usually sleep and then wake up in the middle of the night and my face will feel really hot. I thought it might just be my body temperature so when I take off the blankets my body would cool down but my face would still be hot?? I've even tried covering only up to my stomach with the blankets but it still gets hot. It's really annoying I can't get back to sleep and it's not because I'm nervous or anxious. I've  checked everywhere online but I can't find anything. Can someone tell me what's causing this? 
I have been having this problem for years  I awaken early every morning (3am until getting out of bed) from sleep feeling too exhausted to get up or even open my eyes. During the time I am awake (at least consciously), âwhile closed, my eyes are stuck in REM, twitching around very fast in all directions. Additionally, my mind is stuck in a completely chaotic autopilot mode, flipping from random thought to random thought without any sense of order (objects dropping, planes flying, and whatever the heck you can imagine). It does not feel like anxiety of worrying or emotions, it is just a state of extreme fatigue in which my mind feels stuck and my eyes keep moving.  Upon opening my eyes they stop twitching and my mind goes back to normal. However, I usually feel so tired that it is very difficult to open mye eyes or get up, beacause I just want to sleep. Is this normal of any REM sleep disruption, or is it a specific problem? 
Hello everyone I am a 20 year old male and I suffer from hypochondria and anxiety so bare with me on this one. However on most nights when I try to go to sleep I have this weird occurance where I am falling asleep and my eyes are closed then my brain and shoulder area have this weird sensation and it's kind of like my brain ticks me awake. My body doesnt move/heart doesnt race or anything it's just my brain kind of zaps me awake every few minutes when I close my eyes. This doesn't occur every night but it has been happening more frequently. I was never able to find anything on this because everywhere I read it says hypnic jerk or myclonus but those involve limb movement unlike my issue. Mine is just my brain that zaps me awake with no body movement whatsoever. I have gotten checked by many doctors including neurologists and even a brain MRI (for other reasons due to my hypochondria) which came clean however this sleep disturbance is really scaring me because it makes me think this is due to something sinister when it can just be something benign yet I don't know because I have never heard of anyone with this symptom. It's been so hard to sleep because the more it happens the more my mind expects it to happen when I try to sleep so it happens a lot more. Anyone with a similar experience or know if this is called something so I can look into it? Thanks. 
Well I have had sleeping problems for many years, the Dr's never seemed to be too bothered about it so I treated myself with over the counter sleep aids (Sominex) I have been taking these for months maybe 8 months consistantly because it was the only way I could fall asleep. Well a week ago I stopped taking them and last night and the night before I have had multiple lucid dreams and I have been sleep walking.  One of the lucid dreams I had was; getting a new tattoo done and I'd actually scratched one into myself with my finger nails. I woke up with blood all over the bed sheets.  This morning I woke up to find my PC had been turned on in the night and I had infact purchased a game on Steam called "cat lady." I explained it to Steam and I was refunded (thankfully) I don't recall anything.  No one else could have done it as my door is locked and I sleep alone. I really don't remember it. My dad also sleep walks sometimes he wakes up and scratches the walls. I haven't slept properly since I started school and I'm 25 now I gave up on seeing the Dr because they really do not want to help. Is this a temporary problem that will go away is there something seriously wrong and is there anything I can do? 
Last night I went to sleep as usual, I had a weird but spine chilling dream, which then turned into a horrible nightmare. And in the nightmare the very freakish man who was walking behind me who I turned round to find out what hell he wanted said something like 'your friends told me you haven't been feeling to well' and although it sounds insane I started to feel like I was about to collapse in the dream. I then was in my bed felt awake but I was hallucinating. And I was scared of course. I was trying to unplug my phone which was beside me from the charger but every time I did it just seemed to go back in and the phone wouldn't unlock or anything and I thought it was real of course and that someone had gave me some mad trippy drugð So I tried to shout for my brother but I literally couldn't get the words out but I could move it was so weird. I'm not sure if the dreams/hallucinations happened at different times but since I woke up I'm feeling really on edge. Although it's so unlikely I hope someone else has felt the same 
I have been suffering with this issue for many, many years now and it seems to be getting worse. Falling asleep is not an issue for me but staying asleep is. No matter when I go to my bed I only sleep for 2 hours and then I awaken and I am fully awake. I have tried all the normal things in an attempt to fall back asleep but nothing works to the extent that I have to get up. Sometimes I get tired again and can go back to bed but many times I only manage to dose in a chair until morning. I seem to function OK and hold down a very high pressured job but, as I mentioned earlier, the situation is getting worse and I cannot continue like this. Does anyone else have this issue and if so, how do you manage it? 
Iâd like to share my experience of a few years of moderately serious insomnia and my solution that has led me to recover over the past few couple of months. Hopefully it will help someone else.   Before I tell you my solution (last two paragraphs) I just need to tell you a bit of the back-story â¦  It started when I was. Iâm 27 now. Looking back perhaps I have never been a brilliant sleeper, but the whole thing largely came out of the blue. I did all the usual things people tell you to do at first. No caffeine, lavender, milky drink, relaxing music, exercise, getting up etc, etc. All no help to me whatsoever (I now know trying to do all those âtricksâ probably made it worse!). My average was 4 hours a night. But 1, 2 or even 3 days a week would be 1 or 0 hours sleep. On a weekend I might be lucky and eventually get to 6 hours due to not having to go to work but that was a treat! Nytol worked a little bit at first but after a while I was taking 3 of the â1 a nightâ tablets over the course of the night and it still having no effect whatsoever â must have built up a resistance. I learned to cope surprisingly well at work. All but 2 days in those three years did I miss any time off work due to the insomnia and managed to do all the jobs and interacting I had to do up to a good standard. But when I got home I was an utter zombie. I missed out on seeing friends, going out, just generally things I wanted to do. It made me so irritable. It used to make me cry a lot and I know it began to get distressing for my family to see me in such a state. I know things were getting bad when I began drinking myself to sleep out of desperation a couple of times. Iâd literally buy a bottle of spirit and drink it in bed until somehow sleep was achieved. Doctor prescribed me sleeping pills. They worked very well but quite rightly I was only allowed to take them short term. I turned to the internet and googled away and friends and family tried to help me too but the advice was always the same â âyou must be anxiousâ. But I wasnât anxious! I was definitely a very happy person (apart from not sleeping of course) I had nothing to worry about, my life was really good. So why on earth was I cursed with this problem?! It was really baffling.  My insomnia was fairly unusual... Like many insomnia sufferers, when I would go to bed my mind âwouldnât switch offâ but it was the way it wouldnât switch off which was fairly extraordinary.  Basically, when I closed my eyes ready to go to sleep I was plagued by âvisionsâ. Itâs hard to explain but if you put a camera to my head you would see a crazy miscellany of things. Places I had visited, bits from tv programmes, imaginary things, shapes and colours as complicated as a moving aboriginal painting -all flashing through my head. It wasnât every single night this used to happen but it was frequent enough to train my mind into the habit of âbedtime was not a time for sleepingâ. Then the summer holidays came. I worked in a school and I thought that over the 6 weeks holidays â without the pressure of work- I would be able to crack the problem by being ârelaxedâ but in fact things got worse. This is when I truly realized my problem was not anxiety related. I had run out of ideas so I decided to go about making chances in my life and lo and behold they worked!  I enjoyed my job but I knew it wasnât what I really wanted to do, nor well-paid. I gave it up and now I make my living from being a nanny and a waitress and far more importantly, I have more time to concentrate on my art and craft hobbies. I have always been a very artistic person- ever since I can remember  I truly believe allowing myself far more time be creative â like my character is naturally inclined to be- has been the silver bullet. Now I do my art and craft late into the evenings and then I go to bed and fall asleep within half an hour which is a minor miracle to me! No more âvisionsâ. I can only conclude that I am more creative than most people and I have to âuse itâ in order for my mind to be able to rest. I have had 3-4 months of good sleep now so perhaps I have recovered? My fingers are crossed.  
So If I do not set an alarm my body normally wants 10-12 hours of sleep. My normal bed time is between 1-2am and my normal wakeups are normally 7-8am however I am normally almost never tired at 2am in the morning. I feel like I am almost always too awake and active to sleep even after having a busy day or excercising. I have tried offsetting my sleep schedule but am always unable to fall asleep allnight in every case of me going to bed before 1am.  I can only get myself to feel tired if I miss an entire night of sleep.  I was wondering if this should be worrying at all and if I should fix it, I myself have no problems with it other than I would really prefer it if I could get to bed before 1am however I have never been able to for atleast 10 years (Im 18) 
I have been a sleep talker my whole life. It hasn't really been a problem, it's mostly mumbling, my girlfriend finds it cute. Unfortunately, recently, I have started doing some random actions while sleeping. We recently got a dog, and I have been partially waking up from a dream that I think our dog is in our room running around. Unfortunately I think the dream is real and start grabbing at my girlfriend thinking she is the dog, scaring her to death. Last night I grabbed her really hard and was squeezing her for some reason, which is not acceptable because she has compression fractures and other back problems. Before the dog I woke up once and ran around the room thinking my girlfriend was badly hurt, I think she spilled hot oil on herself in my dream. I was just wondering if anybody knew of anyway for me to stop this from happening. Or at least reduce the severity of it. It was mostly harmless before but it's getting worse. I cannot stand the thought of my girlfriend being afraid of me.  
Hi there I am 28 years old and ever since i was a little girl i have had this reoccurance that has always annoyed me and it wasnt until today i actually spoke of it to my mum and she also claimed that she has had this aswell over the time. Basically when i am off to sleep and my eyes are closed i can see a black background and objects in a distance that a very small and then they are moving/bouncing around and getting closer to me and becoming so big its untrue. I have seen and felt my thumb enlarge and then move around and then get smaller etc, my tongue and legs and also random other objects too. But when i come to open my eyes i am feeling really dizzy and faint and obviously the objects etc have stopped but then asoon as i reclose my eyes it happens again and again. Then i don't have this again for another year or so and is exactly the same thing that happens. It not a nice feeling but very strange. Just wondered if anybody else knows exactly what i am talking about and had this experience aswell?? Would be very interesting if you had.  I am not into drugs, hardly drink, have depression but this started when i was around 5 years old onwards.  Thanks Emz xx 
Hello,   I did say last time I'd report back about the Trazadone 50mg I had been prescribed, I apologize for not doing so. It's a strange one tbh, not much sedative effect and gave me flu like symptoms most mornings. I stuck with it for 3 months to give it a real chance but it ultimately did nothing. I was getting some sleep but no where near enough and felt it very difficult to get back to sleep afterwards.   But hey, I was sleeping and feeling a little better! Anyone who has read my negative, sleep deprived dismissive comments in the past will know that's a good thing. Sadly it wasn't enough though and after having a bad reaction last Thursday by upping the dose (as advised btw, just 2..) I have stopped taking Trazadone completely. No side effects I may add which I'm surprised about.   So I visit my wonderful GP today (seriously I love this guy compared to the quacks I've saw in the past..) and he agreed that stopping the medication was the correct way to go. We have spoke extensively about no more antidepressants but his hands really are tied with this. But he listens to me, appreciates that I do my own research and is happy for me to suggest certain medications that I think may help me, on a long term basis of course.   Today we discussed Mirtazapine, he advised that it is in the antidepressant family has been commonly prescribed for insomnia in the past in a controlled way. I agreed to give them a try, I've got 2 weeks worth to try but going back next week for a check up and possible repeat prescription.   My questions are has anybody good/bad experiences with this Drug with regards to sleep? I hear it is great for people with low tolerance and can be used for long periods of time, but I've also read about the dependency of it so would like a little insight before I start my course tonight.   Kind regards,  Lee.  
It happened several times before sporadically, though it hadnât happened for a while. But it has definitely happened again. I was choking last night in the middle of my sleep, again. I was slowly waking to a terrible choke and found that my jaw was wide open, my throat was closed, and I just couldnât breath. I was suffocating for no apparent reason and warning. I had to shut my mouth right away and grasp for air. It took my body a while to calm down before I could sleep again. It was horrible.  Would I be wrong to consider my experience last night a symptom of sleep apnea? Can anyone confirm or disprove it for me? If it is not sleep apnea, then what could that be? Your help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks 
Hi there, I was hoping someone could help me! I had a baby 4 weeks ago and it was a traumatic experience! But my baby is fine now. I didn't sleep for days then I got very anxious! I was so tired but could sleep! When my baby is alseep I'm awake! I have a lot going on in my life at the min with other children to bring up and also with my house getting flooded I'm all over the place! I was put on sertaline 150mg to help and lorazepam 1mg to help me! I have been on this for 3 weeks! I decided to not take my lorazepam and just go for it! But yet again I'm still awake making it harder to cope with things the next day! I'm so scared that I'm going to loose my children cause I won't be able to function! I just wish I could get back into sleep routine! Can anyone relate and did it get better? ð 
I am being refered as an emergancy to the sleep clinic, as i have constantly stopped breathing in my sleep.. To the point where i lose sleep because i'm too afriad, yet i then get to that point where i am too tired to stay awake and it is a vicious cycle.. Im not sure when i will get an appointment, i guess they will call and let me know, the issue is that i am going on holiday in 5 days with my bestfriend.. And now i'm not sure if i should go or not, incase it is a risk, or that an appointment will be made for me during that time, do i still go on holiday?  or do i blow it off to get these issue's looked at, i dont want to be riddled with anxiety whilst im in another country, but i also dont want to waste the change of me facing my fears of flying and going on adventures and making something of my life.. Might i add that i also have chiari malformation, a brain condition, which i believe is all related to my sleep issues.  What do i do.. I am so afraid   
So i am being referred to get a sleep study as the doctors suspect i may have sleep apnea or narcolepsy, or both lol.. But when i get this done, what happens if i cant sleep? I always have trouble sleeping and staying awake.. But im never able to sleep at appropiate times  what do i do? Does it matter when you fall asleep during a sleep study? 
So i have a chiari malformation type 1 which is a brain condition, and recently i have developed new symptoms, well.. ive had them before but they werent much of a regular thing like they are now. I havent been diagnosed with sleep apnea or narcolepsy but i'm getting these issues checked out.. do you think its possible i have these? My symptoms include: Visually dreaming (hallucinating with my eyes closed) before ive fully fallen asleep, and when these happen i am aware of them, kinda cool but it does freak me out..i sometimes ear sounds too, again when i'm concious during dream state and not fully in deep sleep, its really weird to explain. Just as i am about to fall asleep i realise i have stopped breathing and i wake out of it and gasp for air, ive never woken up in the middle of the night choking though, its only when im just about to drift off. I can either sleep for england or not sleep at all.. I require a lot of naps as i tire so damn easily.. but naps always make me feel really odd and then it takes away all the tiredness for bed time, i only allow myself to nap for 20mins tops. The only time i will ever have stable energy is if i am asleep by 9pm and awake at 6am. most of the time my sleeping pattern is out of whack, its awful and brings me down all the time, and actually scares me quite a bit. I get sleep paralysis quite a bit, i had it years ago and then i didnt have it for years and now its come back with vengance lol..  Does anybody experience these same symptoms? Have you also been diagnosed with them? can i live a happy and normal life with it?  i am afraid   Thankyou. 
Hi I'm 20 years old now and this used to happen sometimes when I was a kid but isn't so frequent now. What happens is I wake up in the middle of the night not from a nightmare I just wake up and I feel like I'm going to die. I don't panic or scream I just sit up and I don't really know what's going on. I feel so disconnected from my actual self but I still partly understand things. I usually just sit upright or walk around the room sometimes mumbling to myself. I remember when I was a child I would sometimes cry and go and wake my parents up but they never really understood what was happening. After maybe an hour I usually go back to sleep and wake up the next day as usual. At the time I just feel like the only thing that is happening is the fact that I'm going to die and it's a really terrifying experience. Just wondering if anyone has a similar experience or if someone can explain to me what this is?  Thanks  
I have imovaine, but I feel groggy in the morning when taking it. I can fall asleep with melatonin but wake up 2-3 hours later & can't sleep. I'm looking for a prescription pill that won't make me feel so groggy in the morning. Thanks 
I'm 7 weeks post op p from a TKR. I have horrible insomnia! Sometimes it's as late as 5am and I still haven't slepr!  I've tried 2 prescriptions but they give no relief. I've tried Benadryl, Tylenol PM, Norco and combinations of all the above in addition to Melatonin.  I don't know how I'll go back to work when I'm barely falling asleep at the time I need to get up!  How can surgery have made such a mess of this?? 
I am a 24 year old girl. I am looking for a serious answer how can i reduce snoring? 
I am struggling like many with sleep issues. I am a heavy smoker.  I always wake up 1.5 hours into a sleep and thinking I can take a couple "drags" and fall back to sleep (and I do)...and I burn my comforter by falling asleep with lit cigs..etc.  So, in the past I had successfully quit smoking with an electronic cig. The last 2 nights...I brought an electric cig into bed with me...and I have taken a couple drags off that when I wake up...and noticed that I have been able to sleep 3 hours at a time.  My conclusion is the smoking is seriously affecting my problem I already have with insomnia...  I am posting this for anyone who smokes like me and has insomnia... And I am posting for myself..because I am a little bit relieved that I have figured this out...not a total cure....but better.   
Hello,  I'm always tired. I get around 7-8 hours of sleep a night (24 yr old male). Recently I've started tracking my sleep and I get on average 40minutes of REM sleep per night. I am on medication (zopiclone) to help me sleep when my GF stays as I barely sleep at all when she does. So I took one last night when I slept by myself to see if it helped my quality of sleep at all and I had 4 hours REM sleep for the first time it's been over an hour since I  started tracking two weeks ago ( i only track when I am sleeping in my bed alone ).  What can I do about my terrible quality of sleep? Really don't want to have to take medication every single night for the rest of my life, i'm young and in very good shape, not stressed just can't catch a good night sleep.  Would love to hear any advice... I mean 4 hours of deep sleep last night i woke up and still feel tired but presumably it's because im chronically deprived of sleep.  Thanks, Kris 
Hi all  I have been using a normal portable pulse oximeter CMS50D+ by Contec to measure in good estimates how my sleep quality is. I seem to have trouble analyzing my sleep graph. I recognize that anything about 95% SpO2 is a good range to be. Anything below spells some sort of trouble. This is for the experts here, how do you filter out noise from data that you really want to look at.  Please take a look at the attached for an example. This data is partially from my sleep last night. 
Hi i have major anxiety problems and even worse sleep problems. Have been given zolpidem as a new drug in the hope it helps...  just wondering if people had any experiences whilst on this that they could share with me to curb my anxiety on taking them. Thanks  
Hey guys,     As the title suggests I have been having trouble with falling asleep, this issue is not recent I have had this problem for a very long time (I would say 3+ years). I am 21 years old.   The problem is: I never found it easy to simply rest my head on the pillow and fall asleep, what seems like a relatively simple task to others is a nightmare for me. I once went 3 or 4 straight days sleeping a total of 2 or 3 hours. I do not know what the problem is. The strange this is that melatonin even sleeping pills do not have any sort of effect on me. Just a week ago I took a pill (Calmepan 3mg) and it didn't put me to sleep, it only made me extremely drowsy almost like I was drunk. I don't know what the problem is, sometimes it comes and sometimes it goes. However, even when the sleeping problems subside it is still a relatively difficult task for me to fall asleep. I actually got used to it. Sometimes in order for me to sleep I would have to stay awake for a full 24 or 48 hours so my body would be forced to shut down. What's even stranger than that is this: sometimes even when I'm feeling extremely sleepy and I tell myself "Yes! Today is the day where I will not have to try to fall asleep" I still have troubles. It's almost as if my bed doesn't want me to fall asleep. I could be extremely drowsy and fatigued but as soon as I enter the bed and close my eyes I feel awake as ever. So what's the problem?  
Can i take benzehexol drug together with halipeliridol antipsychotic drug to help with insomnia?Since my psychiatrist has been giving me a drug called aripatas/aripipazole(an antipsychotic drug) together with benzehexol & lamitor as treatment for depression & i slept fine. Plus does helipiridol have any bad reactions towards drugs like benzehexol,lamitor & aripatas/aripiprazole?   
I have been experiencing very weird sleep incidents for the 9 months. Sometimes when I begin to fall asleep, I feel this pulsing in my ears (kinda like when you yawn and you can feel the pressure in your head) this is the first symptom that happens. I then begin to hear this very high pitched ringing in my ears and its so loud that it becomes incredibly painful. I also cannot move my muscles and sometimes I feel like I am floating off of my bed and doing weird contortions with my body. I am completely lucid when this happens and I always tell myself that it will end soon. Last night was the worst and it happened multiple times in a row. I remember my arm being bent and I tried to put it down but the ringing only got more intense and kinda almost punished me for trying to make it stop. My doctor could not explain to me at all so I'm here trying to see if anyone else can relate.  
I'm 30 and have had insomnia since age 19. It used to be that it would take me forever to fall asleep, and I still sometimes have that issue but that's easier to deal with with the occasional use of meds (trazodone). Now that I'm older I seem to have some version of Advanced Sleep Phase syndrome. I've always slept on the earlier side but it seems to be getting worse and worse to the point where I can easily fall asleep at 8 if I have nothing to keep me awake, and then I will wake up around 4 and sometimes even 3:30. I used to work until 10 PM so being able to stay awake if I have to is not as much as an issue (though I find it nearly impossible if I am home alone with nothing to do). However, I have yet to find ANY way to force my body to stay asleep until at least 5. Very occasionally I will sleep until 5:30 but even if I don't go to bed until around 11 I will still most often wake up around 4 or 4:30. Then of course the sleep deprivation will build up and I will be exhausted.   Has anyone found a solution for this? I tend to wake up several times in the night anyway and I avoid looking at the clock because I know that if I know it's close to time to wake up I will get excited about being awake and doing things. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal since in general I am getting between 6-7 hrs of sleep a night but it does affect me psychologically in terms of feeling socially isolated and just generally anxious about not being able to sleep. 
Hi, I'm new to group so hello. I've recently had some legal issues where I needed to explain how narcolepsy effects everyday life and I wasn't very successful in my efforts. In one instance I had a judge comment that, "we'll see if we are being led a merry dance", when I tried to explain why I couldn't remember signing a document. Turned out that the document was forged but I didn't get any apology. Another, the judge totally ignored the letters from my treating neurologist. I got her decision overturned eventually. These were civil litigation cases, not criminal situations but even so. Trying to get legal assistance from someone with a knowledge of Narcolepsy and it's effects seems to be difficult. I just wondered if anyone on here has had the need for this type of legal assistance and were successful in finding someone? Any pointers would be really appreciated.  
I've had difficulty falling asleep since I was a teenager (27 now), but over the years the problem has only gotten worse.  To put it as simply as possible: No matter how tired I am during the day, I am never tired or sleepy by the time I have to go to bed.I believe this is partly a case of DSPD (delayed sleep-phase disorder), because I do tend to fall asleep faster if I stay up until well past midnight. The problem is I have to get up at 8AM and there is no way to get around this (I own an independant store that opens at 9AM).  I am not stressed out when I go to bed or thinking/worrying too much, I am simply not tired. If I go to bed at 10PM it feels like I am trying to sleep in the middle of the afternoon. I ted to fall asleep between 12-12.30 at night which is around 1 to 1,5 hours later than I would like to fall asleep.  Going to bed earlier has almost no influence on when I fall afsleep: For example if I go to bed at 10PM I'd fall asleep at 11.45, while if I go to bed at 11.15 I'd fall asleep at midnight. 30 minutes of laying awake is the minimum though and I consider that a REALLY good night.  To make matters worse, I am a competitive athlete which makes a good restful night's sleep all the more necessary. This is also why I have stubbornly only used a few types of sleep medication, because it is EXTREMELY important that my reflexes/focus is not impaired the next morning, which is a side effect of nearly all sleeping aids. What I've tried:  1mg lormetazepam: Slept fine but did not feel rested and felt groggy the next day 3mg melatonin: Had no influence on falling asleep and woke up in the middle of the night way too energized like it was the middle of the afternoon. Passiflora extract: no effect ZMA: no effect.  The bottom line is: I sleep 6-7 hours a night, I only feel rested after 9-10 hours, and no matter what I try, I can't seem to fall asleep quicker, or even be tired when it's time to go to bed.   
Over the years, I have noticed I get a certain type of dream, which I think only happens when I am stressed. Basically, I dream of whatever room I happen to be in at the time - which makes it seem like I am awake. For example, a hotel room, my bed room, etc. The first one I had, I was dreaming of having something important under my pillow as I slept. I woke up in a panic as the thing that was meant to be there, wasn't. And for what seemed like ages, I searched for it on and around my bed in a panic, only to discover it was dreaming. I also have been traveling recently, for up to 10 days at a time for retail shop re-fits. And in the hotel rooms, I have been dreaming of the refit happening around me in my room, worrying that I will be told off because I have been sleeping, or worrying about the fact I'm nude, or almost nude in a working enviroment.... As daft as it sounds, it is actual panic. This can happen from once, to a dozen or so times a night. And when I go away for a refit, it can be every night. Working 12 or so hours a day - with broken sleep, can make the next day so much harder. i am looking for a name of the problem so I can research ways of stopping it or lessening it or something.  Thanks for reading, hearing other things the same or similar would be cool too!   
Hi, I have had sleep problems my entire life however now they are affecting me majorly. I am quite healthy and i quit smoking 6 months ago. I am only mid 20's. On Monday I had a goods night sleep but had to get up at 6am. I felt fine for about 1.5 hours then felt like I had not slept at all. I was at work and i could not concentrate, and could barely keep my eyes open. I would say I felt tired that i have not slept for 24 hours or more.  This happens if i force myself to get up early in the morning. If i get up at my own pace i do not get extremely tired during the day. I think i am getting around 7 - 8 hours sleep normally sometimes more. This morning I was woken by my alarm and had a crazy experience trying to get up. I was not sure if i was awake or asleep and it was like battle to get up. I think i called out for help at some point but this may have been a dream. I eventually managed to get up and then starting from about 11am I have been very tired and cannot concentrate. I have been to the Doctors several times over the past few years and I get blank faces. I have tried loads of things but nothing seems to make any difference. Any ideas or know where I can get help?    
This happened just last night 20/3/16 but i hasn't happened before then for about 3 years or so. This may not make sense as it is rather hard to explain but I'll try my best to include the details    Basically i was drifting off to sleep, when i suddenly woke up, and my whole body felt numb, and i couldn't hear very well or see good either. If i tried to move i would freak out even more and exacerbate it. It feels as though im about to faint ( if anyone has ever fainted and felt that feeling, where you black out/ white out) my vision goes all white and bright. But if i close my eyes i am able to contain the feeling off passing out. So i guess closing my eyes and lying really still calms me down.  It only lasted about 5 mins probably, and i basically just lie their very still until the feeling passes. But then i was too scared to go to sleep in case it happened again (becuase it was a very scary experience)..  # For anyone who thinks it might be sleep paralyses or me in a dream state... I know its not as i turned my light On and was able to move #  My Thoughts and questions on it: So i thought maybe it is a stress or anxiety thing that causes this sensation?  Is it possible that my back is out or a nerve is being pinched, as my neck and back are very tight and sore?   Thankyou to anyone who has answers on this or is able to help me figure it out.  
Hi all this mornin I woke around 4am this is normal for me by the way suffer really bad insomnia for the last 18 months but I woke this morning to my hands and arms been numb and tingling and a tight feeling in my chest like someone was stood on it also couldn't swallow properly what is this help !!! Any ad this?  
For the past 5 days I have been almost entirely unable to sleep, I do have a sinus infection, but I don't think that has anything to do with this. I've been dealing with horrible sinus infections most of my life, but they usually only make it difficult to fall asleep, not impossible.  The 5 hours of sleep I did manage to get, includes an hour on the second day, two hours the third day, and 2 hours today. Since that first hour of sleep I got, whenever I try to fall asleep it almost feels like there is a pressure in my head similar to when you are just starting to feel a headache come on, and I am able to get to the point that I feel as though i'm about to fall into sleep, but then i'm suddenly jolted back into conciousness.   Both two hour periods of sleep I got were after I had taken a gravol (it always make me groggy as hell, and usually knocks me out within half an hour), but I still woke up again after only two hours and then experience the same issues as before. Tomorrow I will be picking up some melatonin and giving that a try, as after tomorrow I have to be back to work, and without sleep that just won't be possible. If I still don't manage to get a good nights rest with the melatonin, I don't know what i'm going to do. it'll be a trip to the hospital for me I guess.  I have had trouble getting a proper amount of sleep for many years, but it has never been anywhere near this bad before. 
My doctor suggested a home sleep study but when I called the center to schedule they sort of talked into a lab study because it was more comprehensive. But on the other hand, wouldn't a home study be more accurate in terms of replicating your actual sleep patterns being you're in the same bed, room, noise level, etc?  I'm being tested because of daytime fatigue and nocturia. Welcome any thoughts or experiences.  Jim 
Hell for the past few weeks I've got into the habit of staying up all night and now my body clock only allows me to go to bed at 7 or 8 in the morning. Unless I set my alarm clock for a more acceptable time (which is sometimes unsuccessful anyway as I sometimes go back to sleep due to severe tiredness) I'm getting up at around 5-7pm.  I think you'll all agree that this is a horrendous body clock pattern. What should I do to break this cycle and go to bed and sleep through the night rather than the day? I'm still awake now, I haven't gone to bed. I'm not sure whether to go to bed as soon as possible and set my alarm clock for 1 or 2 pm or just wait it out and go to bed at like 5 or 6pm and risk becoming ill the morning after. Which option do you think I should choose? 
I'm not exactly sure when this started but it seems like it has become more troublesome. I've tried looking up information but seem to get stuck in RLS sites. When I am tired and lie down for bed I feel like I have to keep moving. I have to constantly toss and turn otherwise I feel extremely uncomfortable, almost anxious. I don't feel pain, tingling, crawling sensations or anything else physically. It drives me nuts. Sometimes I resort to a hot bath in which I usually fall asleep in. I sometimes try my heating pad hoping that will give the same effect, but most of the time it just makes me sweat. I am on Synthroid (take in the morn), Norvasc, HCTZ, and Zoloft (which I take at night). I also work 12 hour night shifts three nights a week. This occurs both day and night when I am trying to sleep. Recently, I have even been starting to feel it before going to bed. Anyone else experience this? Any tips or thoughts on what the problem is? Thanks! 
So I've slept poorly off and on for years, and I'm fairly confident my quality of sleep is dependent solely upon my pillow.   When I sleep poorly I wake up very groggy, feeling exhausted, and I'm generally miserable throughout the day. I'll try to switch up my pillow combination and if it works, the first night will be great, the second will be less great but still overall OK, and the third night and on the quality plummets. It's as if my head/body gets used to the new  pillow combination after a few nights, and my sleep quality is at its highest when it's still novel (and my body/head is not used to the new combination).  I've found that sleeping on my side helps slightly, but the problem remains. I purchased an expensive and high-quality foam pillow a little while back and that helped for a surprisingly number of nights, but after some time it was back to normal.   Does anyone else suffer from this "condition"? Is there a solution other than constantly exchanging pillows in the hope of getting a good night's sleep?  I should also mention that I'm very healthy, I work out several times a week, eat well, and I turn off all electronics and read before bed. I don't think changing my lifestyle is the solution here.  TIA for any and all help.  -James 
Hi everyone, I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what your narcolepsy symptoms are like? My doctor thought I'd got it, sent me to neuro who doesn't think I have. I seem to have all the symptoms, but obviously don't know what the reality of the symptoms are. I could sleep all the time and still be tired. My tiredness has got so bad I've had to keep going home from work to sleep coz I couldn't function or think or anything!!!(Lucky my line manager's not based in same office)- With mild narcolepsy are you aware that you're tired and falling asleep or does it just happen? I've fallen asleep for a second whilst driving. According to my neuro this doesn't consitute as falling asleep.  When I'm so tired I can't function I start to dream while I'm awake- I can hear voices and see my dream and talk to people at the same time!?(though not coherently) I don't see people in reality that aren't there- it's more in my head when I'm half asleep. What is it like when you have the 'visual hallucinations'.  I also think I have cataplexy because my muscles suddenly go- I can stagger to a chair-this has got better with the medication I've been on (fluoxetine) so now it's more a weakness. I've noticed this tends to be emotionally linked- if I'm upset or get a shock or am anxious.  I've also woken up paralysed on numerous occassions- this usually lasts anything from a few secs to half an hour, but once it lasted an hour- so the neuro said it can't be- the one time it lasted longer my muscles were stiff yet most of the time they're floppy-   I'm sorry to ramble on- I just need to know from yourselves- the experts whether these are how you experience narcolepsy or if it definitely isn't. Obviously I don't want to have it and I really feel for you all, as I know how much it is affecting my life!!- But the neuro couldn't offer any explanations as to what it could be!?  I hope you can help me- thanks for listening! x 
A while back I had a lab sleep test done and it showed moderate Sleep Apnea. At the time my testosterone levels were really high like 1,700 total. I read that testosterone can make Apnea worse so now that my level is much lower say 400 now I have noticed that my CPAP machine shows no Apnea at all for 2.5 hours of sleep. Now I think a new test is in order. I may not need the stupid machine at all. Has anyone else ever had a sleep test that may have been botched do to high T? If so please let me know. 
Hello, I'd appreciate any help/advice please. Last year i had a multitude of sleeping disorders, hypnic jerk, restless leg, insomnia, but there was one thing that started it all off. Come the summer they all faded away and i've slept soundly for almost 7 months now, until tonight, it's starting again. Basically, i start by feeling extremely tired, more tired than usual, so i went to bed early (9PM), i was in a light doze until almost midnight, being aware of my surroundings and tossing and turning. I woke up a few times between 12 and 1, until at 1 i was subconciously aware of myself (what feels) violently slipping into a deep sleep. But not a pleasant deep sleep, it feels horrible, it feels like falling down a well and then being trapped and unable to escape whatever i'm dreaming about, and the dreams/nightmares tend to be frighteningly vivid and graphic. I generally can't wake myself up and when i eventually do manage to i physically feel like i'm pulling myself out of my own mind.  When this happened i decided to stay up and go online for a few hours - sometimes this helps to calm my mind and get some proper sleep, but when i went back to bed at 2.30 i couldn't fall asleep - my mind was racing with a million thoughts, before once again falling into a very light doze and then violently falling into a deep sleep again, i managed to jerk myself awake this time before i could get trapped. So now i'm wide awake at 4AM trying to work out what the hell is causing this, what it even is and how to prevent it.  Last year this was the first stage, following this i developed severe sleep anxiety causing all my other disorders to be set off - it was a very unpleasant, tiring winter. I'd like to not go through that experience again if i can. Any help would be incredibly appreciated. 
Please help me. I snore daily at night. I tried many remedies to control my snore, but no result. Can you guess advice me something?????? 
All my life I have struggled with waking up in the morning. I am female, aged 71, and can remember this problem going right back to my childhood. I think I may have something called Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome. It doesn't matter what time I go to bed, I find it almost impossible to fall asleep before about 1 am, but the problem in the morning is even worse. I don't think I've ever woken naturally and feeling awake and alert. I am drowsy and dopey and half asleep and if I don't have to get to a job or a meeting I can easily fall back asleep for another 2 hours. It takes three different alarms to wake me up, and most mornings I just feel sick and awful. Do other people have this problem and how do they cope? 
hi, i've been having weird dreams for the past month.  before i go to bed i usually think of the things i'm doing the next day but while i'm sleeping i have dreams that i am doing the activity i'm doing the next day. whether it is going to work or even getting a pair of socks out. every morning i wake up thinking its two days later. the strange thing is, is that what ever happens in my dream, it actually happens whether it is falling over on a step or deciding to do something i wasn't planning on doing. if you know what it is or how i can stop it please let me know asap 
Please help me, over the last couple months my partner has been waking me in bed seeming to be a completely different person and it's tearing me apart and very frightening. He swears at me and laughs then leaves to go home. This is very distressing as I am asleep until that point. I've told him to seek help and that we can't be together until he has, as I can't rest peacefully anymore when we go to sleep. It's like he's on edge and restless when settling  then this happens.its very scary and he is seeking counselling. Prior to last few months this never happened, we have been together for 12 months. I am greatly concerned and wondering if this is the beginning of other things.your advice would be greatly appreciated  
Hi, I am a media student and currently making a short film where the main character suffers from bursts of insomnia brought on by stress. The last thing I would want is to portay this condition incorrectly, therefore I am asking if you would be willing to share how insomnia makes you feel and act. Anything posted in this thread may be quoted in my reserach folder that will be purely for education use and will not be published anywhere else on print or online. Thank you so much! Siobhan 
I am 27 and have been suffering from insomnia for 4 years... For 2 years I almost never got more than 2-4 hours of sleep per night..   I tried all natural remedies like  hypnotheraphy, acupunture, exercising a lot, but nothing started to really improve until I started taking antidepressants. I am not depressed but they helped me sleep.  Then those stopped working and the dr was hesitant but moved me onto sleep aids like Ziploclone. Then I got addicted and now they don´t work either. Doctor has suggested switching between meds and also taking anti anxiety pills (bromazepam) as my case is quite serious.   I still try to work out as often as possible, I rarely drink alcohol, and almost never have caffeine. I drink herbal infusions and use aromatherapy to help my anxiety.  I regulate my intake of meds as much as possible and can fall asleep naturally once a month or so. When I do manage to sleep, I can sleep quite well and I have lucid and vivid dreams.   The problem is that the insomnia always comes back and seems to be at worst a week or two before my period.   For me the problem starts to improve and then it gets bad again.  It definitely hurts my mood, makes me anxious and gives me headaches. Sometimes I feel like a zombie and get very depressed.   Any insights?     
but i'm struggling to stay awake at the moment. I take Modafinil (900mg a day) for my narcolepsy and venafaxline (100mg) for my cataplexy. Does anybody else take modafinil? and if so how much per day?   
Hello, my name's Carl, I'm a Highschool Senior due to graduate on May 25 . I've been diagnosed with Hyper insomnia, depression, and anxiety.. I try not to use them as a excuse but I used to always sleep nearly 15 hours a day.. Now I'm lucky to get 2-4 hours of sleep a day. I think it might be because I've been really stressed lately, even though I'm going to graduate and I know that... When I try sleep I start getting a headache and if I stay there it gets worse, but when I sit up and stay awake I feel fine. I don't fall asleep during daily activities, heck I hardly feel tired. I've tried melatonin but I don't even get drowsy. The main thing on my mind is, "Leave Michigan (where I live) and go be by myself.. Any advice would help me.. Thank for reading, sincerely Carl.  
Hi folks, I have been on CPAP for OSA now for a year and I have always had a bit of AHI being in the low range around 1.3, but recently I have noticed the CPAP is reporting no events at all and all my numbers are 0.00. Is this possible? Can it have gotten better? I have lost weight and lowered my TRT replacement. At the time of my sleep study my Testosterone level was high at 1,500. It is now at around 350 to 400. Could the high level of T caused my AHI of 37? Now it would seem as if it is low. Has this happened to anyone else? 
Hello Folks,  First off hello to everyone as I'm new here.  To give a bit of background for the last 5years+ I have what I would class as 'poor sleep' of which 3 years I have been seeing an NHS specialist and have pretty much given up that I will get any help from them after the last recommendation was to have a couple of alcoholic drinks if this helps me to fall asleep (very shocked that a UK DR would recommend this as a daily solution).  Hence I'm posting here to hopefully get some help.  Symptoms Restless in bed Taking hours to fall asleep Waking multiple times through the night Feeling awake when I do fall asleep Short tempered with friends and family Low libido Mood Swings Constantly tired/lethargic Rare morning wood  As mentioned over the last 3 years I have been on and off -  Circaden (2-4mg seems to help me get over to sleep but even up to 10mg/night doesnt help me stay asleep all night and I feel groggy in the morning) Pretty much been on various doses of this for the 3 years, occasionally I tapered down to see if it made much difference. Zopiclone (occasionally but don't like the side effects) Temazepam (more frequently than Zopiclone, but didnt work as well - also didnt like the sides) Clonazepam - I was on this for over a year and it did help stay asleep but I felt groggy in the morning and coming off it from a 1yr+ was an emotional roller-coaster! ZMA - This did help me to get a few hours that felt like 'deep' sleep though I'd be awake shortly after it.  I've tried self meditation apps, Head Space etc with little luck.  I've also over the 3 years been keeping a daily log of the following -   Tiredness (1-10) Quality of Sleep (1-10) Libido (1-10) Mood (1-10) Irritability (1-10) Motivation/Energy (1-10) Diet (1-10) Stress (1-10) Blood Pressure Resting Heart Rate Weight Any medication I am on  When I did plot a graph of the above it was easy to see that my perceived sleep was better when on the Clonazepam etc.  I was also tested for low testosterone but it fell within 'normal' range (albeit a the low end).  Really at a loss to do so if anyone has anything they can suggest I am open to options, experimental or otherwise?  Thanks and sorry for the long first post! BigPete 
For the past two weeks I been having sleep problems.  It started with sleeping 4-5hours and then for two days I slept 0 hours. After many days of this on going battle I went to the doctor.  One of the nurses joking around said, "let's hope it's not sporadic fatal insomnia". I was terrified when she said that since I suffer from anxiety.  She then apologize for saying that. I told the doctor my concerns and she run some blood work . She said she wanted to rule out physical problems.  However I feel like this is getting worse as the time goes by . This whole week I can't get myself to sleep and If I doze off I am awake by jerks or a feeling that my breathing stops.this causes my heart to race and I feel panic. This can go on a many as 15x  a night and if I do fall asleep.   MY SLEEP FEELS EXTREMELY LIGHT AND I WAKE UP EVERY 1 OR 2 HOURS . I ALSO REMEMBER ALL MY DREAMS. I DON'T FEEL LIKE I GO INTO DEEP SLEEP.  THIS IS WHAT'S SCARING ME.  do I really have sporadic fatal insomnia where you die from not getting deep sleep or is this how insomnia is???  I am really scared and I feel like  depression is starting to set in. Since I never has this before.   Please help  :, ( 
Hi, I'm a 16 year old teen and I was diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy a year ago.  Recently I've been noticing something kind of strange. I sometimes take naps in the afternoon and my mom will wake me up sometimes to ask me if I want to go if she's going out somewhere. I usually have no memory of this.  I'm told I'll sit up and speak as if I normally would and my eyes are open and I look normal and awake. I'll go back to sleep when I'm left alone I guess, but I do not recall this. I often wake up and freak out about the house being empty so I'll call my mom and she'll tell me I told her I wanted to stay home and sleep or that I told her I didn't want to go. What do you think is causing this? I'm sort of frightened by the thought of being conscious but having no memory of it. 
I am absolutly exhausted. Awake all night. Sleep slowly getting worse over last few months dr had me on amitriptyline  10mg  started sleeping 6or 7 hrs but a complete zombie during the day. Non functional. With brain fog. I dropped dose to 5mg. Sleep about 6 hrs . Still dopy all day. Last night was tied forgot pill. Dozed for less than an hr.  Awake rest of night. Grrrrrr 
I have a sleep formula pill that I take at least once a week. Here are the ingredients:  Valerian: 300 mg L-Theanine: 200 mg Gamma-aminobulryic acid: 250 mg 5-HTP: 250 mg. Melatonin: 2 mg.  Will I go through withdrawals if I stop taking it? 
Hey all, i have a horrible time falling asleep, i almost always have to have a TV on to listen to and concentrate on in order to fall asleep. 90% of the time if i shut off the tv within minutes my mind is racing over negative thoughts. People i hate that have wronged me, lost loves, revenge I would like to have, then the next thing im full blown angry, heart racing and no chance of falling asleep.  Its always just something random, worry about bills, worry about a better job, think of someone i hate/that wronged me. Once i fall asleep im usually good, its just so hard to get there. I cant shut my mind off. Ambien is a joke and does nothing, same with valium, i will chew up 3-4 off the shelf sleeping pills and sometimes that will put me out.  The only times i have ever fell asleep well is all drugged up. Like a big ole xanax or so drunk i pass out. I just wish i could close my eyes and fall asleep, but as soon as its quiet my mind goes 100mph.  
It's 9pm and already I'm feeling panicky and emotional about going to sleep.   To my knowledge over the past 12 years I have suffered varying degrees of \&quot;night activity\&quot; at differing levels of consciousness and at different times of the night. Usually every other night and anything from sitting upright in bed for a few seconds before lying back down and going to sleep again, shouting, chatting, crying; to getting out of bed and wandering round the house unlocking doors and switching on lights.  However, I've had about 5 cases of extreme night terrors which I now believe to be hypnagogic hallucinations. These always happen not long after going to bed or not long before wakening up. They are, without doubt, the most terrifying of experiences and take weeks to come to terms with.  The most recent one was on Thursday night not long after I went to sleep. I always have my eyes open when they happen and have the ability to take in the details of the room about me. It's just that there are always additional details which my mind seems to trick me into believing are as real as the furniture.   On Thursday night I opened my eyes to see two shadowy figures, male, at the end of my bed, standing there looking at me. I was so scared and unable to ration that it was a dream state, I was sure they would rape or murder me, that I screamed twice which was enough to raise my levels of consciousness enough for the figures to just disappear. I know I screamed because my throat is still sore, fortunately for my boyfriend he wasn't there at the time. My fear was so extreme and I was so distressed that three days later I'm still carrying the emotional anguish.   The worst experience of extreme night terror that I've had was when I woke when morning, again my eyes were open and there was someone sitting on my bed with their legs across my body, I could feel the pressure of their body. They had a balaclava on (so no facial detail again as in the last case) but I conversated with the person who I believed was my boyfriend and he told me he was a terrorist and threatened that he'd kill me if I told anyone. After some time, maybe three minutes, my fear must have peaked enough to raise my consciousness levels and he just disappeared. I was left staring at the curtains. It was so traumatic that I still carry the emotional distress and can remember every detail of it 10 years later. Strange, I can't even remember things I did a couple of weeks ago but this etched in my memory like a death. The conversation I had was not auditory, I know it was constructed within my mind, but at the time I couldn't reason that out, it felt so real.  I have to seek help on this but I don't want to have to take drugs and that seems to be the preferred route by medical practitioners 
I feel I get to sleep after a long time then am rudely awakened and need to rush to the bathroom to rinse out my mouth to remove poison. If I swallow while rinsing I think I will die. Does anyone else have this nightmare or fantasy and if so what causes it? I almost daren't sleep in case I am really poisoned. Hope you can help. 
hi all, i hope someone can help me diagnose this problem i have. For the past 2 years, it is like i stopped knowing how to sleep. I have had severl health issues, lots of stress in my life and 2 episodes of AFIB. I am on an off Beta Blockers. Here is what happens: I fall asleep well and quickly. Then, every hour, i wake up suddenly having to stretch my entire body and the need to yawn. My heart beat is fast. I need 5-10 minutes to lower my heartbeat and i fall back asleep. Sometimes i am sweating. I do this about 6 or 7 times per night.  I am going to ask my doc to schedule a sleep test. My girfriend tells me that i snore a little bit but nothing major. I try to always sleep on the side.  Any ideas? It scares the living daylights out of me. Needless to say, it affects me in other ways as well.  thanks. 
Recently purchased some 'high quality melatonin'.. Improve your sleep it says...  Lies. Don't bother wasting your money like I have, in fact do not buy any legal sleep aid as thet are all a waste of f*****g time!!!   P.S. Your doctor can help you, but the law in UK says they can't. Guess I just have to learn to live with this life ruining illness and never have a wife, family and all the simple things I wanted out of life.  
Hey everyone, id like you all to take note that this has only occured to me about 3 times before and its by no means a current issue, however i am immensely wary of it and want to know what it is that ive been experiencing  a little background info first : i go through periods of Insomnia and slight depression, and naturally i can be a little anxious. This can sometimes amount to me actually having minor hallucinations at night such as hearing faint words or seeing things in the corner of my eyes, leading to paranoia  anyway so basically, the first time it happened ( Worst time ) i was extremely fatigued and feeling very uncertain about my life, etc. I began to feel a little tired and started dosing off in bed, and thats when it happened. suddenly, my door was thrown open, and a dark figure ran into my room very fast. the next thing, the intruder was grabbing my hair and dragging me around my room. I woke up very quickly and bolted upright, screamed fairly loud. This dream was particularily traumitising because at the end i saw a dead corpse under my bed  i had a panick attack and was crying for about 10 minutes, before calming down. The dream was so realistic that to this day i cannot distinguish the difference between it and reality.  What the hell happened, thanks guys! 
I went 5 days without sleep, it was teh holidays couldn't see the Doctor so I phoned NHS 24 they gave me 3 Diazipam to help me sleep which worked but last night am a wreck again no sleep, I don't wan to go through 5 days without sleep again Doctor said no sleeping pills or Diazipam will be prescribed due to no helping the situation they only mask it and Diazipam has bad effects.  i also got my mother to get me something fromt eh chemist to maybe help which is diphenhydramine this is an allergy pill, i suffer from anxiety and panic will this help me or make me worse and not help me sleep at all let me know if this pill is ok to take thanks. 
 I have been struggling with insomnia for a year now which has caused me to become anxious during the day which doesn't help. I panic when I go to bed, I am an emotional wreck during the day - anything can set me off. I will go for weeks at a time where I am fine, then have one bad night and that will turn into a few weeks of struggling. Sleeping pills don't seem to work anymore. I have seen psychiatrists and psychologists to no avail - nothing seems to help. I have tried Mirtzaphine and I tried to come off it and it made me feel awful - I have now been prescribed Trazadone - however it was a doctor that I had never seen before and he prescribed it and kind of rushed me out of the office and all he told me was to start with 50mg and increase dose as needed but that doesn't sit well with me. Has anybody tried this for insomnia/anxiety and can give some more insight?    
I bought some over the weekend, just waiting for it to be delivered.   I've heard mixed reviews but at this point I'm willing to try anything.. Has or does anybody use this for sleep and how affective is it?   Some reports say it doesn't actually put you to sleep but prepares your body for sleep and promotes better, longer sleep. It has also been known to help with anxiety and depression, two symptoms that cone along with sleep deprivation.   Any information would be great, thanks.  Lee. 
I have been suffering from fear of not sleeping since I was 15 y/o. Now I have 31 and I am confronting a conflict. My husban want to have a baby, but I am afraid of getting crazy during the proces due to my lack of sleep. I have tried everithing to heal my insomnia from meditation-yoga to strong medications. Now the only meds that help me is ativan. I don't want to take any medication while pregnant- could affect the fetus. I feel hopeless, Does any woman with my condition ever have a baby? I appreciate all your help (sorry for my spelling, english is not my firts language) 
Hi,  Wondering if anyone has similar issues for a number of years now I would say 4-5 years I am really struggling to sleep, I know I am tired but cannot sleep and also cannot close my eyes for extended periods of time, after maybe a few seconds I have to open my eyes and take in the surroundings of the room. I don't know why I feel I have to do this I try my hardest not to but my eyes will open anyway and I will scan around the room. It even gets to the point where my eyes are actually hurting but making sure my eyes are open so I can see the room for some reason In my mind takes priority over closing my eyes to relieve the pain. Some nights it is worse than others and I can go a couple of days with no sleep at all sometimes very minimal sleep 2-3 hours after total exhaustion takes over.  If anyone can help Or explain why this happens I will be grateful 
Is Sertraline making me have trouble sleeping? I've had weeks where I had trouble sleeping 3 nights, but I've had a couple of weeks where I only had trouble sleeping one night. 
Dose anyone now of a forum that I could communicate with  Others throughout the night as my long sleepless time go's real  Slow and lonley? 
Hi,   First, before i type anything else, i just want to let you know what i have Autism so i may not make perfect sense but i hope you can understand what i'm typing.   I've had this problem for years now, i can not tell when i'm going to fall asleep, it just happens, it can happen anywhere and everywhere and it's really annoying. I've even fallen asleep literally on top of some very large speakers going at full volume, i've fallen asleep in the middle of a football stadium and on the bus, i just keep randomly falling asleep, i can't control it, it's making me feel exhausted every single day from sleeping ( i don't know if that sounds weird ) I even fall asleep while i'm talking to someone or in the middle of typing on my keyboard  When i wake up, my body is shaking, i used to think it was an earthquake but it's not, it's me that's shaking but it feels like my bed / room is the one that's shaking, sometimes when i wake up it feels like i've been frozen, i can't get up but i know... or at least i think i know that i'm awake, i just can't get up, i'm frozen  Since some of the cuts, i have lost my carers / personal assistants that i could go to the GP with so i'm unable to go and see a GP now because i haven't got anyone to go with, do you think this could be diet related too? because i am unable to cook without help (that i don't get anymore) i usually just have 1 bowl of cereal or soup a day  Please can i have some advice on what i can do to try and stop this from happeneing? i really want it to stop   Nick 
Help!  I've had insomnia off and on for years, but for the past month, I'd developed a pattern where I  will only sleep every-other-night.  By this, I mean that will pull and all-nighter, and then sleep 12 hours the next night.  This parttern has remain unchanged for about 4 weeks now.  I have never taken sleeping pills because they terrify me, and do not like the side effects of over-the-counter drugs.  Does anyone else have this problem.  Sleepless in Boston  
At least once a week my girlfriend tells me that in the middle of the night I wake up and try to wake her up panicking that there's something in the bed, a spider, snake, lizard, something! It varies time to time apparently, yet I have no idea that I do it until she mentions it and then I vaguely remember it happening.  I'm quite an active sleeper, sometimes sleep walk and sleep talk but just wondered if there was some hidden meaning behind this, why am i panicking that something is in the bed?? To the point when I'm scared (whilst asleep) and won't get back into bed for 5 minutes where I calm myself down in my sleep.  All very strange but just wondered if it's unhealthy and that I need some light shed on it.  Male, 22 by the way.  Thanks  
 After having a breakdown 18 months ago along with  antipsychotic and antidepressant medication I was prescribed zopiclone to help me sleep.  I took it every night (7.5 MG) for over a year and then my general practitioner decided I should not take it any more. He instead prescribed to me  promethazine hydrochloride  25 mg but have never had a good nights sleep since. What to do I do about it? Any advice is greatly appreciated.  
Hi all, I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this. I have had a thing before where when I'm doing something boring or relaxing, usually reading, at work or a book, I'll get an irresistible urge to close my eyes and sleep. By irresistible I mean I can try to resist it, but the longer I do the harder it gets until I can't anymore and just close my eyes for a second. If I'm sitting at work say I will then jerk awake, I assume after only a few seconds as no-one around me seems to notice. When I awake, in my mind anyway, I have still kept working, usually solving something I was working on! And I can remember keeping working, but when I jolt awake and look down at my screen,  the (awesome) stuff I just wrote isn't there, just a line of gobbledygook, I realise quickly what happened as I remember jerking awake, and see what I've done doesn't match my memory. This is something that hasn't happened for a few months, but did actually happen in the morning the other day. The reason it is troubling me so much now is that later in that same day I didn't do something I was meant to, but I can vividly remember doing it.  So now I'm wondering if this is the cause of my false memory, but if that is the case I'm rather scared by it as that means I had the sleep thing happen without me noticing, which obviously raises the question of if this has happened before  Does anyone have any experience of anything like this? 
Hello!  Not sure if ive posted in the right section and this needs to be in child health?  Anyway. My daughter is 3, and has always snored so loud. Around 3 months ago though i noticed that she was gasping for breath, holding her breath, and her breathing was generally all over the place.   I finally got ab appointment with an ENT last week & the asked us to do an oxygen test, which we have. And they have booked us back in for June to review the results and consider surgery (she has enlarged tonsils and adenoids)  I want to know though, is she ok to go to june whilst she is breathing so bad in the night? It scares the hell out of me. Last night she stirred and woke herself up because she couldnt breathe and when she went back to sleep i was watching her and she was holding her breath for as long as 17 seconds! Breathing, holding, gasping.   When she had the oxygen teat we attached a little to her toe at homewhich read her oxygen levels in the night. I checked on her and he machine at 2.30Am and she was breathing soooo bad. Her oxygen levels at this point were between 77 & 88. This is not good, right?  Should i call the hospital and ask for a sooner appointment or is she ok to go on like this until June??   Is there any experience with this?  Thank you 
I have a huge work load but somehow I just sleep about 12hrs a day. I can't help it. What can I do?   Im 17.Its not that I'm not passionate. I have huge goals/ dreams but I just sleep. Even on the desk.  As a kid, I kinnd of slept from 5pm to 6am. I don't know why.   What can I do? I feel like compromising on my life as I have a huge work load as well.  I can work late for a couple of days barely max. (Late for me means after 8-10pm).  I also fell low on energy and I haven't drank milk for as long as I can remember (lactose intolerant).   Several teaspoons of a strong coffee and I still sometimes sleep. Ritalin helps me get through the time I feel most sleepy but after taking it just once, I couldn't feel anything the next time and had to double the dose. (Consulted a friend medicine student) I don't think Its healthy to keep taking it and I don't think it will keep helping.   I also once easily slept after a 4teaspoon coffee dose (which was quite strong believe me! Had to drink it while holding my breath ). I even unwillingly slept easily just after taking a 10mg Ritalin. (I was working on my bed) 
About a week ago I started having some leg spasms and pains in my lower back. About 3 days ago I suddenly started having sleeping problems. I've never had insomnia before this. The first night I got 5 hours which is odd for me because I usually sleep 8 or more. Ever since then I've been unable to become tired. My body is tired, but my mind isn't. I know I need sleep, because I'm having trouble remembering things. I already tried melatonin, but it didn't seem to do anything for me. I looked up my symptoms and now I'm convinced I have sporadic fatal insomnia. I know its rare, but I have a lot of the symptoms. I hoping someone can give me insight into whats going on and what to do now. Any help at all would be amazing.  
Does anyone know if it's possible to use zopiclone twice a week without developing tolerance/physical dependence issues? 
I used to take half a Sertraline in the morning, and half at night.  Now, I take both halves at night. Could it be making me have trouble sleeping? 
I go to bed at 10:34, and if I'm not asleep by 10:50, I take a sleep formula. Do I need to give myself more time? 
I've recently ive been taking Zopiclone for a short term because of my developping insomnia. I was wondering if anybody else has use/using it and how they like it/affects them. It doesnt really help me fall asleep but when i do i manage to get a decent 3-4 hours of sleep instead of a usual half hour. Also it completely ruins the taste of any food i eat after i was up with a nasty pill taste and i'm wondering if that's just me? I'm new to sleeping pills so i'm reall unsure what to expect/ 
So for roughly 6+ years I've battled with the beast known as insomnia. Last year I was almost certain I'd beaten it, I slept for around 4 months straight with no issues. However 6 weeks ago I had no choice but to change my working hours from 7am-3pm to 3pm-11pm, also with the odd nightshift + overtime.   This has completely ruined my sleep pattern and currently I'm sleeping maybe 2/3 days a week out of 7. Apart from the usual symptoms (lack of concentration, clumsiness, headaches, mild paranoia, stress, depression, increased anger etc etc....) one thing that is beginning to worry me is after a few nights of no sleep my heart rate is through the roof, resting bpm is over 100 which is known as a tachycardia (mild heart problem). At 27 years of age   After reading into it I've found that sleep deprivation is connected to numerous heart problems including heart disease, heart failure, irregular heartbeat and many more. I've mentioned this to my doctor and the ***** said 'i can't prescribe benzodiazepines.' Wtf!!! Needless to say I'm never seeing my GP ever again as they seem to think I'm after sleeping pills after 6 years of asking for help?? My house is like a chemist, I have plenty of sleeping pills, most of which given to me from friend's who are concerned about my health, but refuse to take any as I'm educated on benzodiazepines and know they aren't the answer. Guess my doctor thinks heart disease isn't an issue huh?  Does anyone else suffer from/worry about this? I'm honestly not sure where to go from here. My main problem is work. Work work work, the absolute plight of my life.... It is the main thing that causes me not to sleep yet not working isn't an option. I'd like a 9-5 job but I've looked all over and can't find anything in my sector which doesn't include working early/late or nights.  I don't want much out of life, a nice home and a family of my own is all I've ever wanted. This is simply unachievable in my current state. I think it would be unfair of me to let a girl into my life given all the problems I deal with on a day to day basis. Sadly I'm now beginning to have thoughts of suicide even though it's something I doubt I could go through with but who knows......  I need help. 
I have been diagnosed as suffering from sleep apnea although this is supposed to be mild   I wake up a couple of times in the night, I wake in the morning with bad headaches and not feeling refreshed at all this has been going on for 3 yrs, I do not get on with a cpap machine as it is invasive and I wake up more when I use it, I am falling asleep at work which clearly is not ideal during the day I have to force myself to do anything I have no energy tearful and putting on weight please help I have been to the doctor this morning and nothing can be done  
Hi, I'm on 150mg of a Beta Blocker and 100mg of antidepresent and i'm worried this is what may be affecting my sleep.  I've struggled with nightmares for years and I also struggle with stress, anxiety and depression. Over the past few weeks I have been waking up all sorts hours of the night and not being able to fall asleep. I have around four hours sleep a night.  I also have nightmares all night and wake up hot and sweaty and unable to calm down.  What should I do? 
I take occasionally a 2mg tablet or Diazepam (Valium) to help me sleep. This might be once or twice a week.  I need to know if this would adversely effect my memory as I'm 79 and suffer from a terrible short term memory.  And suggesions or help would be appreciated. 
My psychiatrist yesterday suggested a sleep study to me.  So..I looked up some information on a sleep study on the computer and I see some pictures of a guy with probes on his head...and some gadget strapped to his chest....laying on his back!  #1 - How do I sleep knowing people are "wathching" me?  I can't sleep as it is.  #2 - I toss and turn from side to side.  How does one move with all this equipement on them.  #3 - I think I would not sleep at ALL with the equipment on me, being in a strange environment and knowing people are watching me!   
After a nights sleep I wake up with a headache which is slightly relieve after a drinking water although I still feel tired and fuzzy headed for the rest of the day.  The headaches started to occur after after I moved into a new build house. Our last house was colder and humid. The new house is warmer and less humid.  Is it possible that warmer and dry air cause dehydration overnight? Can that cause morning headaches and fatigue during the day? 
Can anyone please give advice on dosage amounts for taking trazodone for onset anxiety caused from chronic insomnia? I am from Australia where you cannot get it so had to order online as heard such great things about it helping with insomnia. Have tried both mirtzapine & valdoxin but mirt caused a lot of weight gain & valdoxin didn't help at all. Any help would be greatly appreciated! 
I have been diagnosed as a chronic insomniac.Tried everything herbal, medical from acupuncture to hypnotherapy.Also suffer from an essential tremor.Doctors have their hands tied with me.Nothing more they can deliver.Any advice please ?. 
Hi, I've been referred for a sleep study on the nhs and I've been waiting five weeks and no appointment letter through yet. They can't seem to give me any indication of how much longer i'll have to wait. Just wondered if others had had a sleep study roughly how long you had to wait for your appointment?  Thanks 
Hello,  Ever since I was little, I've never slept through the night, and I can pretty much count on one hand the times that I have. My problem is that whenever I sleep, I have very detailed dreams and I dream throughout the night. When I wake up during the night, I'll go back to sleep and start a new dream. I would say I wake up between 5 and 10 times a night, but it's usually just to turn to the side and I fall right back asleep within 30 seconds or less.   This is not something that has occured lately, it's what I've always known. I can remember specific details from my dream and can recall almost everything that happened.   Once in a blue moon I sleep through the night and whenever I do I will wake up with a headache, and the rest of the day is ruined because I'm tired and my body feels heavy. When this happens I will also not have any dreams, at least that I can remember.   Even with waking up 5 times a night and always dreaming, I will usually wake up feeling well rested, so it's not necessarily a problem, but I'm very curious as to why I'm such an excessive dreamer. Also there isn't an increase in dreaming if I am going through a hard time, it always stays exactly the same with waking up and dreaming whenever I'm asleep. If I take a 15 minute nap (I have a timer on), I'll dream then too.   Sorry for the long post, but I just wanted to know if there is something I can do to control this because lately they have been so detailed that I'll have trouble remembering if something really happened or if it was part of a dream.   In advance, thank you!  
It started about 6 weeks ago I was diagnosed with anxiety and was perscibied citalipram for which I'm scared to take, then I resulted in going on herbal stress relief after 5 days I was admitted to hospital for the night, my heart had problems regulating, i stopped taking the herbals straight away, after this I had a fear of going to sleep, 4 days later the insomnia started to emerge I would get some nights of 4 to 5 hours sleep which decreased on the remaining 4 weeks now for the past 8 days I've only been getting  7 to 8 hours Every 36 Hours like I'm stuck in a 48 hour cycle, please help as I'm now scared that this is not going to get better 
So...I started listening to my body and instead of listening to Drs and having a "routine" for sleep...like going to bed at the same time everynight.  I started going to be when I felt TIRED!  So....that worked ok...I go right to sleep no tossing and turning.  And I always woke many times in the night...but now when I wake up at the 5am time...I start panicking and can't go back to sleep.  So panicky about it...and think about it all day...as I type this...my heart is racing.   Does anyone else...start a cycle of waking up?  Like now for the past week I have been waking up 1, 2, 4 and 5.  A couple weeks back I had a better schedule. like waking up at 2, 3 and then 7...that was awesome!   
As many here...I've strugged for years. I'm 52...female...toss, turn, panic at bedtime.  There is medical guidance to go to be same time each night to maintain a routine and I have been doing that for 2 years.   No matter how tired I am...I wait till 12 to go to bed..because that has been my ROUTINE.  Well, last night I was so exhausted at 10...and I decided I was going to go to bed.  I realized this morning that the thought of the "routine" was really stressing me out.  I followed that routine because the medical community says that works.  But, I felt alot of pressure going to bed at the same time every night.  Going to bed when I was tired last night: I fell right to sleep (no tossing and turning) I felt less pressure I slept better (I know because I had dreams REM sleep the deepest) I still arise many times during my sleep time for the commode but that is a different problem to discuss with my Dr. I awoke feeling more refreshed than I usually do.  So, I am going to try the same thing tonight...when I am tired...I'm going to bed.   The only problem with this is that I take sleep medication.  And I was taking it every night at 11pm...to get to bed at 12.  BUT...I did feel very tired last night at 9 and I said sc*w it.....I'm taking my medicine NOW...so I guess that is how it will work.  i thought i would share this for people who are trying the "routine" thing...maybe you should try going to bed when your tired.   I feel rested today and I feel like being rested is going to lead me to having a less cranky and more productive day.  
As the title says, my sleep is suffering. Especially the last week and a half. I work graveyard shifts part-time 4 days a weekm so i tend to try and sleep through the day. But recently i just can't fall asleep, i start to get uncomfortably warm and a little sweaty even with a window open and i don't know what it is. I'm currently taking zoloft once a day for depression but it hasn't affected my sleep as i take it before bed, and it does make me a bit drowsy. Each day i'm getting less and less sleep, and it's weird because sometimes i feel fully rested when i haven't slept for more than 3 hours, but the rest of the time i'm struggling to keep my eyes open even after pounding down an energy drink or two.I've tried reading 
Cut a long story short. One year of depression/anxiety. Taking Lofepramine with limited results. Sleep pattern tends to be this:  Fall asleep ok but often wake again in an hour after vivid dream. Usually not a nightmare,  more a trying to find something in a building and never getting there. Wake out of sorts but go back to sleep most times. Overall the whole nights sleep tending to be no more than 5 hours. Tired in day and evening. Because after the 5 hours am out of sorts from ruminating thoughts the nurse for Cmht today recommended a sleep aid called promethazine. Though i need no help getting to sleep this was recommended for just a two day burst to help get some nights with longer sleep to avoid the ruminating early waking. The pharmacist would only give me sominex, is this actually the same thing? Will this really help in the way described? The pharmacist had her doubts as these are meant to help get you to sleep which i am ok with. I struggle with staying asleep.  Really tough time at the moment so any advice gratefully received. 
Ive been diagnosed with G.A.D and have serious problrms sleeping. Was taking 3mg of diazepam for the past fortnight but have run out last night im just wondering if i can take 1mg of lorazepam yo help me sleep tonight before i see my doctor again tomorrow. Just wanna know if its safe due to my anxiety. Thanks in advance 
Hello, after 9 years of working a night shift I've finally managed to get back on days (still at the same firm). My sleep has always been an issue but hopefully I will be able to get it sorted now that I'm sleeping at nigth instead of days.   I'm still tired after sleeping about nine hours, last night although I was shattered I couldn't get to sleep and then I woke up for about 2 hours, I know it will take me a little while to get back to normal, but as a part time student, I really need this to hurry up. I've read about sleep debt and how I should just sleep for as long as by body wants  to reset it, but would this be the same advice for an ex night worker trying to flip his body clock back to how it should be? I'm sure if I slept all day,come bedtime I probly  wouldn't get to sleep. Should I just stick it out and got to/get out of bed at the same time each day.  My education is my priority and I need my brain to be at its best, which is stressing me out,   many thanks for reading any advice would be great  Luke 
I work in a kitchen open 8am till 11pm so my shifts could change from 6AM-4PM to 12PM-12AM!  I don't just do lates and I don't just do earlies in a week so my body can never get used to one sleeping pattern over a week resulting me being awake all night not being able to sleep! I'm on a weekly rota also so there is no set days I have days off or set times I work each week. Over the past few months I've been on mostly lates working till 12AM but then still having 6AM or 9AM starts thrown in there so my body keeps stay up all night!  I could be tired all day working but as soon as I'm getting ready to go to bed or getting in bed I'll be wide awake and won't be able to sleep for another 2-3 hours after getting into bed no matter what time I get into bed! Then it will all repeat over again I'll be so tired when waking up the next day because I wasn't able to sleep the night before and be tired all day at work then getting home to get into bed I'll be wide awake again even if I did get a rubbish night sleep the night before! Is there any way anyone could help?  I've tried turning off my mind, turning all lights off around me getting into bed with no telly no phone no distractions before sleeping. I just can't find a way and I'm just getting more and more tired each day because my body isn't letting it catch up on a night... Someone must have a good trick or something?! 
Hi guys..   I find it really hard to sleep at night, It almost like my body is exausted but my brain wont shut off..   I have recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and one of the syptoms is insomnia. I can't sleep at night but when i finally get to sleep and my brain has shut down when it comes to getting up in the morning for work, I can't. I sleep through alarms, people could be screaming down my ear, world war 3 could be happening and i wouldn't wake up.  Please, Does anyone know any ways I can help myself get to sleep before I get sacked? 
Good morning everyone, I hope you are able to help me or at least provide some information!  i've been having what in my house has been coined as "one of your sleep things", on and off for nearly 10 years now.  Essentially I get up, while still asleep, and "have" to do something, because something has gone somewhere.  Normally this is relatively benign, just there's "something" I need to do, which usually results in pushing beds, moving furniture, throwing off bedsheets.  But sometimes it can enter full Night Terror mode, where I wake up sweating and there's something which I perceive to be an immediate threat.  Last night for instance I "woke" up and had to throw my bedsheets off, opening the window and nearly throwing them outside because there was some sort of poison on them.  The worse one I've ever had was a dream where I was nearly going to be ground to mulch by an enormous rotating blade and I woke up screaming.  They seem to come in fits and bursts, and my sleeping routine hasn't really changed much over the years, go up to bed, read for a bit, go off to sleep.  It's getting to the point where it's beginning to effect my sleep enough that I am constantly tired at work, so any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated! 
Hi guys, New here and just looking for some advice.  I am a struggled sleeper, i either sleep very lightly or some nights what seems like not at all.  On average i am in bed between 10-11 and up at 6.  However i wake up at least 3 or 4 times a night, sometimes it's just for a few minutes sporadically and sometimes for alot longer maybe half hour.  sometimes when i wake up i feel like i need the loo however when i get there i don't really, i think this is pyschological.  I also also seem to be constantly warm, even in a cold room.  for example last night the room was very cool yet under the duvet in the morning i woke up absolutely drenched in sweat.  It's beginning to become a frustration for me as i'm worried i'm ruining my girlfriends sleeping as well.  Does anyone else get overheated at night and remain uncomfortable alot, constantly change position and wake up alot like me? If so, what do you do to try and help it!    
I READ AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND MY ILLNESS MORE BUT IT STILL SCARES ME. CAUSE NOBODY LIKES TO LOOSE CONTROL TEMPORARY OR NOT. I WAS WONDERING ANY LIKE MINDED FOLK WANNA COME TOGETHER AND RAISE AWARENESS CAUSE THIS ILLNESS IS SERIOUS IF I COLLAPSED IN THE STREET NOBODY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING CAUSE SOMETIMES MY SPASMS ARE LIKE A FIT.   
Hi there, I suffer from severe sleep anxiety. It reared its head last May out of the blue - causing a month or so of chronic anxiety, a bit of depression and hopelessness. I felt like I would feel like it forever. I ended up going on Mirtzaphine which immediately helped and had sound sleeps and manageable anxiety for the next 7 months. In December I came off the Mirtzaphine but instantly became anxious with no sleep again, going back on the Mirtzaphine didn't help and am now on Veldoxin but it hasn't had the same effect. I may sleep well for 3 nights then have 5 terrible nights and my anxiety during the day consumes me. I've tried meditation work shops, yoga, I've been seeing a sleep psychologist for the last 7 months but nothing seems to be helping. Sleeping pills are the only things that get me to sleep on bad nights but they seem to make me just as anxious as having no sleep. I'm at my wits end - any advice possibly would be greatly appreciated :-) 
Hi I'm Lex, I've had insomnia for as long as I can remember. Possibly since before I was a teen. I am 28 years old and a mom of three little ones. For almost as long as I've had the insomnia I have had the same recurring nightmare but it comes and goes. Its somewhat strange when I 1st started dating my husband he said I would jump I'm my sleep and tense up when he would hold me. I would already be in a deep sleep by the time he got to because of the graveyard shift he used to work. I told him of my nightmares and he was very understanding since he is a combat vet. Through the years though the nightmares slowly stopped but I still had insomnia. 2 months ago my nightmares started again. They feel so real to me I almost feel crazy talking about them. Its always starts with me laying down trying to sleep, of course tossing and turning. I look I'm the corner and see a dark figure. For yes I could not see a face just a mouth moving like its trying to tell me something but I can never make it out what its saying. I once had a dream that the figure was choking me when I was in highschool. I must of been screaming because when I came to my mom was over me trying to wake me up. Last week I had the dream again but when I tried to wake up the figure rushes to me and before I could open my eyes it looked me in the eyes for the 1st time. What does it all mean? I've tried different ways to help with the insomnia in the past but I feel like it males the nightmares worse. Please help. 
Hi everyone.  My problem is that I almost always wake up about an hour before I really need to.  I usually go to bed about 11 and my alarm is set for about 6.40am.  Almost without fail, I will wake at about 5.30am for no apparent reason.  I almost always go back to sleep straight away, I don't lie wide awake fretting or anything.  My bedroom is always dark (particularly at this time of year) and I usually use earplugs to eliminate any noises that might disturb me.  This has been going on for about a year now - prior to that I used to sleep soundly right up until the alarm went off.  So does anyone have any advice?  Should I maybe accept it and get up at 5.30?  Cheers JM 
We have all heard phrases such as &quot;going weak at the knees&quot; in moments of heightened emoption. I wonder how this familiar experience compares with actual cataplexy: I have narcolepsy and either mild, infrequent or absent cataplexy.  That is, while I do sometimes feel &quot;weak kneed&quot; if something unexpected happens (eg I once realised I had left my purse in a shop I had just lef.  I hurried back in (and found it, untouched, where I had left it) but suspect that the wobbly kneed feelings I had would also have been experienced by many others in a similar situation, without that experience being labelled as cataplexy.

Since December I have been suffering from insomnia. I had moved from my country to a new country, and after a month, these insomnia problems started. I was sleeping only 3-4 hours a day at a time, and my sleep cycle was distorted. However, in late December when I returned to my country for a while, my insomnia vanished. In January, I came back to the new country, and the insomnia has returned. Nowadays, I fall in a light sleep at night for a few hours only. Furthermore, in the morning I feel extremely dizzy and tired. I am also facing memory problems, in the sense I cannot remember events and things that happened a few days ago, which other people do. Do I have fatal insomnia? There is no history of the disease in my family. I am very scared. Please help me. I seem to have all the symptoms of the disease. I am only 27 years old. The memory problems are mostly that I dont remember what day a person said we should meet up, or where exactly I had dinner a few days ago, and whether it was that day or some other day. I am really scared.      
So the other night as I was trying to fall asleep my throat closed up and it scared the hell out of me... I tried to sleep again.. Same thing kept happening. Eventually i fell asleep though. I was also getting these kind of zaps to my head and WOW they are scary!   Could this just be anxiety? Please don't tell me the throat thing is sleep apnea!!!! 
Hi guys,  I made a post about having sleeping issues some months ago. Since then, this has gone away and come back a number of times (the last time it came back, the doctor gave me a few days worth of sleeping pills to get my pattern back on track) and I've been sleeping okay since (apart from fairly frequent wakeups, but its significantly better than before).  Now I'd like to talk about something which I'm currently very confused about. The first time this happened I really wasn't sure what it was, and I wrote it off as a dream, but now I'm really not sure.  I âwake upâ completely paralysed. I'm unable to speak and move. The first time this happened, it felt as if I was dragged out of bed onto the floor. It felt incredibly real, but when I awoke I was still on my bed. I was terrified, I had to spent a few minutes looking all around my house to reassure me that everything was okay.  This has happened a number of times since, and I really don't understand what's going on. This morning, I woke up a number of times completely paralysed. I would imagine that this would be sleep paralysis, but whilst I'm lying in my bed, I can see things that normally aren't in my room, and at one point, it felt as if I was being dragged out of my bed onto the floor. What makes this so terrifying is that it feels so real, I really don't understand what is going on. Are these just a series of bad dreams, or is this sleep paralysis? I was also in this state when my alarm went off and I awoke from a dream, so it felt as if I was stuck in this state as my alarm was going off. Not sure how long it took for me to snap out of this and switch off my alarm. I'm currently taking 30mg of mirtazapine a night.  Does anyone have any ideas what this could be? Could it be sleep paralysis, even though I'm seeing things whilst paralysed?  Thanks,  - James. 
Hi I'm Lex, I've had insomnia for as long as I can remember. Possibly since before I was a teen. I am 28 years old and a mom of three little ones. For almost as long as I've had the insomnia I have had the same recurring nightmare but it comes and goes. Its somewhat strange when I 1st started dating my husband he said I would jump I'm my sleep and tense up when he would hold me. I would already be in a deep sleep by the time he got to because of the graveyard shift he used to work. I told him of my nightmares and he was very understanding since he is a combat vet. Through the years though the nightmares slowly stopped but I still had insomnia. 2 months ago my nightmares started again. They feel so real to me I almost feel crazy talking about them. Its always starts with me laying down trying to sleep, of course tossing and turning. I look I'm the corner and see a dark figure. For yes I could not see a face just a mouth moving like its trying to tell me something but I can never make it out what its saying. I once had a dream that the figure was choking me when I was in highschool. I must of been screaming because when I came to my mom was over me trying to wake me up. Last week I had the dream again but when I tried to wake up the figure rushes to me and before I could open my eyes it looked me in the eyes for the 1st time and I saw the face of a demon or what looked like one at least in the dream. What does it all mean? I've tried different ways to help with the insomnia in the past but I feel like it males the nightmares worse. Please help. 
Hi, I'm a female, aged 21, and for the last couple months I've been having the same dream almost every night..  I have a little trouble getting to sleep, it normally takes me around an hour to fall asleep. When I do finally get to sleep, I've been having the same dream where I lie awake all night, trying to get to sleep. In the dream I'm in my room, in my bed exactly as I was when I fell asleep, but I lie awake all night struggling to get to sleep. It's so vivid and feels so real, and when I do wake up in the morning I'm absolutely exhausted and sometimes can barely function. It really feels like I HAVE Beenham awake all night. It happens at least 5 times a week, and on the nights that I don't have it I wake up a lot, panicking about having to get up in the morning.  I really don't know whats going on, does anyone have any ideas? Thank you  
Hi, I havn't had a decent nights sleep in weeks now..change of meds,ending of job,family stuff,anxiety...I wake up either with cronic restless legs or my brain is racing with all kinds of strange images...drives me nuts..... 
Hi everyone,  I struggle with sleeping everyday and it is starting to impact my life even more. I would get so much more done if I slept better. I'm looking to get motivated in order to beat this once and for all so would love to hear what positive things motivate you to getting rid of your insomnia. I know it would give me more energy to enjoy the things I have in my life as well as performing better at work.    
Iâm totally geared up about finally having a better sleep routine!  So I was wondering, what would be the biggest change in your life if you guys were able to sleep better?  Mine would be Iâd have more energy to exercise  
Male, aged 60. 5 weeks ago, I had a femero-popliteal bypass left leg for blood clots and blockages. It was a big operation, I was in hospital for 6 nights.. I take 4 paracetamol and 4 codeine 30mg, plus Oramorph 10mg during the night for the pain. The pain comes for me every night. I cannot get to sleep until 3:30 or 4:30 a.m The sleep lasts for 3-4 hours. I keep busy during the day doing walking exercises and resting, with no day time sleep. I cannot relax at night.   Part of the problem is that I fear getting another clot or embolism, even though I take Clopidrogrel to stop the blood from sticking. I wake up in pain, but as soon as I get out of bed, the pain eases off.  Where do I go from here? Please advise or suggest. Thank you

DOES ANYONE KNOW OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICATION  OTHER THAN PHARMACEUTICAL? AS THE SIDE AFFECTS FROM.MODAFINILL?  PROGABLIN AND CHLIPMOPHRANE IS TAKING IT'S TOLL 
I wondered if anyone could help with this. My fiancé has been twitching a lot in his sleep recently, his hands, legs and whole body will start twitching and jerking while he's drifting off to sleep and the twitches continues while he's asleep. He said he's aware that's he's twitching so excessively in his sleep and it wakes him up and the twitching and jerking stops when he's awake but starts again when he falls asleep. It's been keeping me up all night too and both of us are struggling to get a decent sleep. Does anyone know what may be the reason for the twitching and why it's getting worse. Thanks  
I was diagnosed with narcolepsy and cataplexy 8 years ago and was put on modafinil to help control some of my syptoms,  my first thought was what had I done to deserve this, why me, and where my life was going to take me. Although only diagnosed 8 years ago I was definately a sufferer from a young child but only developed cataplexy a short while before I went for a sleep study at papworth 8 years ago . My world came crashing down around me not only did I have this condition I felt extremely alone, and even now I can get very emotional talking about it. I am now on the highest level of modafinil that they can give me and have the worry of a possible change in medication. As I had rapid weight loss initially when I started on modafinil. I could talk all day about my symptoms my meds and generally how I feel, but my main point was to bring to the attention of any female narcolepsy sufferer who either hasn't started a family yet or wishing to extend there's.I had a baby 3 years ago whilst on 700 mg of modafinil. She was healthy, beautiful, and perfect in every way. I had to be monitored a little more than normal , but pregnancy was fine. I was advised that perhaps I should come off modafinil as they were unsure whether it could cause any side effects to my baby, I had to make the decision to stay on my meds throughout my pregnancy as it wouldn't have been possible for me to put a day together. 3 years on and she's great, I sometimes think if I hadn't have gone through with my pregnancy I would be sleeping my life away, she gives me the fight to carry on .... 
Hi is anyone else out there suffering from chronic pain and insomnia?  
I have issues sleeping; it's been over 5 years now. My problem is that I can't fall asleep, but once I do, I can stay asleep for multiple hours.  Right now it's 5:22 am and I haven't slept all night and I have to start getting ready for work in about 1 1/2 hours.  Went to a sleep clinic and had studies done and everything. After all the time and expenses I was diagnosed with.... .... insomnia. I'm not kidding, I went to the doctor because I have insomina and he tells me that tests shows I have insomia.  Anyway, since I have tried many sleeping pills, from Trazadone to Ambien, he gave me a combination therapy (I'm taking three different pills right now) and it's not working. So, in additon to medication, I have tried aromatherapy, acupuncture, yoga and meditation, hypsosis, sleep therapist (who just gives me tips on how to improve sleep like cool room, no caffeine, no electronics (yeah, I know I'm breaking that one, but I'm bored)), excise (which only makes me hyper), please know I've tried anything I could think of.  I even took these natural pills that smelled and tasted horrible.   I'm serious, if you know of something that could help, let me know. I'm desperate, this is affecting my everyday life, not just at work, but also my personal life.   Oh, and I'm tired in the day, but around 6-7pm, I get so much energy, it's crazy.  Thanks in advance for your help. 
So last night i go to bed about 10pm. Wake up at 11 having screamed the house down and woken myself and partner up, (surprised the neighbours werenât and banging the door down to see what was going on!)I was petrified, crying, sweating, and unable to speak properly and i felt sick with fear. My partner consoled me, or tried as for the next half an hour i remained a mess. I felt unable to move and didnât want to open my eyes because i feared what i would see. Eventually he managed to convince me nothing bad had or will happen. We took a walk around the house turned all the lights on and off and looked outside front and back door. I started to cry again. I do not remember a dream but do remember feeling pure fear in my sleep but what from i canât pin point. i definitely was awake after the scream and was awake whilst my partner was trying to help and whilst we walked around the house. I did manage to get back to sleep but am fearing sleep as i donât want to experience this again! This isnât the first time this has happened. I also often have nights were i will wake up to 5 times needing to change the sheets or my pjs because of the amount i have sweated through bad dreams or feeling of fear. In the morning i feel like i have been hit by a bus, my body aches and am so, so tiered. This is affecting everyday life for me i need help. Any suggestions or ideas of whatâs going on would be amazing am normally a pretty un-emotional person and not a lot phases me so it shocks me that i wake up screaming and crying. I have read in to night terrors but apperently people are asleep through all of the motions i go through?! Thanks in advance  
My insomnia is back with avengeance, and I'm having real trouble relaxing at night. I'm in a state of hyper-alertness  which basically means I can't fall asleep till maybe 4am each night. I've tried not to focus on it too much, but I can't stop thinking about how tired I'll be the next day.  I've tried cleaning, washing, listening to music, reading books, watching TV shows, even doing nothing, but none of it works.  My main problem is that I'm all alone while everyone else is asleep. I can't make too much noise in case I wake them up and I have a four-year-old to look after who is  incredibly well-behaved, but needs lots of energetic play. This is tough  at the best of times, but even more taxing on very little sleep.   I think the loneliness gets to me the most, and there seems to be no way to solve it. I can't wake my partner up as he has to work, I obviously don't want to disrupt my daughter  as she is generally a good sleeper, and I have nobody else to call or talk to during the night. All I can think about during the day is how tortuous the night is going to be, and then it comes and it's just as bad as I thought. I know this is a vicious  cycle which I have to break somehow, but I don't know how. If anybody has had any positive experience with this it would be great to hear it, as it just feels like a relentless cycle of misery and I don't want that.  I did have CBT a couple of years ago, and it was great, but it hasn't really solved my insomnia or the anxiety that surrounds it. Anyway, if you got to the end of this well done, Saloire             
Hello there, be prepared for a wierd one: I've always had trouble getting to sleep - I can only ever get to sleep is I am brain-dead tierd. But thats not the strangest thing. Last night I didn't sleep at all - pulled an all nighter without even realising. And supprise supprise I was more awake, alert and generally compos mentis. I am more awake than I have been in years!  Has anybody heard of/experiance anything like this? Whete less sleep is more? 
Hi everyone, I joined this site to hear from some people who suffer from sleep paralysis. I have had sleep paralysis for about 5 or 6 years now and know alot about it however I still can't get it under control. I have really vivid hallucinations, sound and visual. Not only are they vivid but they are also very disturbing. I used to have sleep paralysis very often then it stopped for a while and has now come back. I have tried all the normal suggestions and it doesn't seem to lessen the amount I get it. Is this sometime I will always have to live with?. I think the thing that is worst for me isn't the actually feeling of being paralysed but the extreamly disturbing things I see and hear. I really hate to think they are a reflection on me but I guess they are as they are coming from my thoughts.   Can anyone relate or make a suggestion?     
I think i have sleep apnea. I read that the best way to sleep is on your right side, but it really has not worked out for me, i've tried many times. I want to sleep on by back, but i notice that i snore a lot and i have heard complaints because of this. What's the best way to sleep on your back to avoid this? I cannot sleep on my left side as i have acid reflux.  
hi all for the past week i have had trouble getting to sleep 5 hours in 3 days and i feel wide awake, have a sore throat with rather large tonsil do you thinkthats why i cant get to sleep gasping for air 
I have been having disrupted sleep for sometime now and have started to notice the effect in the daytime. Feeling tired, low mood and anious.  I am female and only in my twenties. I just wondered if anyone else was in the same age bracket that struggled to sleep and if this was normal for my age?   Also what products if any, are people using to help them sleep as I would really like to try something.  All help is much appreciated. 
I have this odd thing that happens sometimes when I sleep. If I got to bed after 11 o'clock at night, I sleep fine and wake up the next day at a normal time. However, if I am exhausted (say, I stay only get 3 hours of sleep the night before) I will go to bed at 10 or 9 at night, but wake up (wide awake) at 2 or 3 in the morning. No matter how exhausted I am when I go to sleep, if I go to sleep around 10 or earlier, I wake up after only a few hours of sleep and I can't go back to sleep. Hopefully someone can help me understand why this happens. Maybe it has something to do with my circadian clock, I'm not sure.  
Hi. I've been recently diagnosed with mild sleep aponea. I use a mandibular advancement device at night. I do not use a CPAP machine as the doctor at the hospital commented that they do not treat mild sleep aponea on the NHS via a CPAP machine. My dilemma is as a driver is whether it affects my driving? I do not suffer day time sleepiness. I do sleep during the day but only at weekends. If I was to feel sleepy you would use your common sense don't drive.  I have contacted DVLA and just waiting to hear whether it affects me and my driving.  Anyone been in a similar situation regarding driving and mild sleep aponea? Thanks. 
I have recurring insomnia and it's debilitating. My doctor has prescribed zolpidem which i take for 3-4 days and get 4hours sleep which makes such a difference but I know they're addictive and their effect wears off anyway.I have such awful side effects from my insomnia like anxiety, pain in whole body and just cannot function. I therefore am unable to make any plans as I just have no idea when it'll hit me. It has taken over my thinking and life. Has anybody any advice to help me. 
I've not yet been diagnosed, but for the last 3 years I've been experiencing life limiting symptoms which I've always found hard to explain to my doctor.   The symptoms consist of a sensation or taste that I can feel in my throat and chest, accompanied by a dull headache, & very heavy eyelids, along with great difficulty in holding my head upright. In a lot of cases, I'm in a situation where I can go to bed & have a sleep for a couple of hours. I'm not fully refreshed afterwards, but usually feel better. This can happen again the next day, maybe 3 or 4 times a week, & sometimes it lasts for longer.   Sometimes I feel like this upon waking up in the mornings & am unable to get up.  I don't sleep well at night. Sometimes I go straight to sleep for about 40 minutes and then wake, often with a gasp for breath, & I am tossing & turning for the rest of the night.  My doctor refered me for a sleep study after exploring several other avenues, & I have spoken to the specialist, who thinks it may be a form of narcolepsy but this study has yet to take place, so I am as yet undiagnosed.   I have been up so many dead ends with this, & my life has been turned upsidedown. Do the symptoms I mention fit with the possibility that I could be on the right track this time?   Thank you - Jay 
Basically I been using a white noise machine for at least 6 months and everytime I use it I always gone to sleep before it stops, it is on a timer for 30 minutes. I been using it this week but I am wake when the machine turns off. Why? Have I got used to the noise? 
Hi all, I have been taking Zopiclone 7.5 for 1 year because I am unable to fall asleep. It caused me great anxiety and great difficulty in living a normal life. I was under a mental health team and was prescribed these tablets then. The last few months have been great - I am no longer depressed or anxious and I work a 6 day week. However my GP has decided to stop the Zopiclone now, and I am back to where I started. Laying awake until 4-5 am and then getting up for work at 7... My mind just does not switch off. I have cut out caffeine all together, i dont use my phone in bed and i feel i have good sleep hygeine. I have tried over the counter herbal remedies, I've tried phenergan, and nothing seems to do it.  What can I do from this point onwards? I don't want it to start affecting my life again like it did before.  
I have always suffered with night terrors, since I was a child. However they have been especially bad over the past few weeks. With me only getting a couple of hours of very disturbed sleep a night.  I can normally pinpoint anxiety or stress related triggers, but there is nothing really I can pinpoint at the moment.  I have tried various relaxation techniques, but I was wondering if anyone had any tips or ideas to overcome them?  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. My life is starting a suffer a little now.  
Hi, for the past few months I've been feeling this strange feeling instead of the sliding into sleep feeling I usually have. It's not everytime I fall asleep but when I get it, it's impossible to fall asleep until the feeling leaves. The other night I spent an hour fighting the feeling off.   I can't describe this feeling well, not even to my wife. But it's sort of like a feeling of things feel like their too easy or too simple combined with a feeling of almost feeling sick but not quite. It's a very odd thing. So long as it's there, it's sort of a barrier to falling asleep. The other night it came just after I comforted my daughter back to sleep after she had a nightmare and at first it was only a mild feeling and I was happy because I could ignore it but then the feeling grew and  grew until it was all I could think about. Not even getting out of bed to go to the loo helped.   I have ADD and take ritalin so maybe it's a strange side effect of that. I wish I could describe this feeling better, but does anyone maybe recognise this particular sleep barrier feeling?  
No idea where to post this .. But recently, as I try to sleep I experience a strange feeling in my head. Like I'm fading away and losing power in my brain. Normally I either fall asleep normally and it's ok, but sometimes I won't be able to sleep and the feeling makes me panicked and therefore waking me up. After these episodes I tend to be very shaky and my heart is pounding. Does anyone know what this could be? It makes me very worried.  
I only get around 55 minutes of deep sleep every night as measured by my zeo headband. I spend most of the night in light sleep. I always feel fatigued. I can't find any reliable data on how much slow wave sleep one is supposed to get. If anyone here has used zeo or a sleep study, please inform me of this.  
For the past two years my sleep cycle has gone more and more out of sync. I wake up usually one hour after I initially fall asleep and then about every 45-75 min thereafter, unless I stay awake for an extended period of time, ( like 20+ hours ). I have tried changing everything about it on several occasions. I have a dog that sheds. For the last year I did not even allow her in my room. At first because I was thinking that her hair was causing my sleep problems. That's not the case though since it has been a year and I still wake up several times in the night. I was a mechanic up until about 8 months ago, and I work out every other day, so I know it is not a build up of energy. The problems started well before I stopped my job. I had a nasal polyp removal done about 11 months ago. Still the problem was not solved. I have tried sleeping during the day and night and there is just about no difference. I was recently in a relationship where we were sleeping together every night. Symptoms persisted before, during, and after. I have tried two sleeping drugs, over the counter, whose names have now slipped my mind because I needed to know them, go figure. Pressure points, massaged for relaxation, reading, and TV, all do not help or help. I drink a lot of soda. However, I just started it again about two months ago. I went almost 3 months on nothing but water, milk, and juice. Mostly grape and orange. I am also a smoker. I enjoy smoking but I did quit for 3 months about 6 months ago just to check if that was my problem. Again no difference. I feel like I have checked everything in my life aside from going to a doctor and getting prescription drugs, which I don't want for some unknown fear that I have of them. If anyone reads this and thinks of something that could lead to me actually getting a full nights sleep without staying up for 20+ hours straight every day please let me know. Thank you. 
I have fallen into a cycle of waking up too early - around 4 or 5 am. I feel tired but my head just starts racing even when I'm not particularly upset or stressed. I have been dealing with stress at work for the past year or so and I am doing much better so it seems unfortunate that this problem has started now and has been the case for 2 months.   I can find plenty of advice on getting to sleep but dealing with early waking seems more complex. Any advice would be appreciated!  
Hi i am new to this forum but was wondering if anyone could advise or help me. I dont know why but every night when i go to bed i manage to fall asleep but after a couple of hours in wide awake again hence me typing this now. I will manage to get back to sleep but then i am up with my alarm at 6.30am for work. Its driving me mad that i can never have a full nights sleep without waking up  
Hi everyone for the last two week I've been concerned with weird issue: When I close my eyes in a day time I see randomly moving whitish streaks and strips. Then - in a few seconds - they begin to shape into incessantly changing black and white ornaments. Then - the 3d phase - a kind of screen appears and I watch as multicolored spots coagulating, diverging and emmerging into each other. Finally - the most shocking part - I watch animated movies on that screen. Very vivid colours, neat, distinct contours but all the way long flowing and blurrin and it's hard to catch a plot. For instanse: i see teddy bears dancing in pairs, , ducks, cats and what not. In two second the image starts to collaps and gradually turns into somethin else. EG military maneuvers: infantry, tanks, cavalry, marines. I want to highlight - this is not a dream! I can open my eyes deliberately at any moment. Have anybody expereinsed stuff like that?  And what do you think: is it somatic or psychiatric impairment? Thanks! 
Hiya! This will probably be quite long so I apologise in advance. I'm coming to here to build some research before heading to my GP as my GP tends to not listen and make me feel a fool (like the time I went with chronic hand pain, the doctor accused me of being anorexic, when it turned out to be carpal tunnel!)  Anyway, I am tired pretty much all the time, I never wake up feeling refreshed. If I stick to the same task for a prolonged amount of time I'll start drifting off to sleep, which is especially bad if I'm at someone elses house or work, where I don't have the freedom to potter about and change activities. I'm an avid gamer and have been known to drift off when playing "important" and stressful roles like healer.   I always put this down to being a teenager, and that it was normal, but I'm now 23 (and female) and if anything it's getting worse. I can quite happily sleep for 15 hours, then struggle to get myself out of bed and then fall asleep again an hour later. I struggle to get myself up everyday. With work etc I usually get between 8 and 10 hours of sleep a night. After a couple nights at 8 hours I end up with hallucinations, the odd time when waking up but mostly when going off to sleep.   My concentration levels have really suffered over the years, as well my memory.  If any more info is needed ask away! I just can't think of anything to add right now!   Thanks  
I have had insomnia for 1 year and 1 month now. It came out of nowhere, no major event nor change in my environment that caused it.  I can describe it as, at around midnight, I am suddenly full of energy. If I do fall asleep before then, I usually jolt awake around midnight and canât return to sleep, usually at all. This happens usually once a week, however sometimes it escalates to 2-4 times per week. Sometimes the mind isnât tired (racing thoughts about absolutely nothing), and sometimes the body isnât tired (heart beating strongly as though I have been exercising).  I do feel tired in the runup, 10pm, 11pm, I am sleepy. Sometimes my eyes droop and I am ready for bed.  I have no worries in life, I am not stressed. I am not depressed. I am in my mid-30âs, I am not and have never been a smoker. I am very slightly overweight however not by much. I have practiced the doctor prescribed âsleep hygieneâ point by point, but to no avail.  I have other irregularities that have shown up since. Some of them are consistent, whereas some of them come and go. I am posting them in the offchance they are connected.  -Heart palpitations. These are approx 3-4 times a week, my heart will skip a beat, then race for a few moments to seemingly âcatch upâ.  -Lightheaded / Energy spikes and dips at random. I noticed the lightheadedness above all when I am exercising. I was mildly anaemic in my teenage years, with similar effects, so I have disregarded this as possibly an iron or b12 deficiency. I am a vegetarian. There are slight visual disturbances when the lightheadedness occurs.  -Sharp pinpricks all over, noticeable at night. These can only be described as very sudden pricks or spots of intense itchyness that come and go, irrespective of whether i itch or not. I have changed laundry detergent for my sheets to no avail.  -I urinate more frequently these days, however admittedly I do drink a fair amount of water (probably 4-5 pints over the course of a day).  -Consistently very light coloured stool and occasionally diarhhea. These seem to occur on the days after I havenât slept, so I am discounting them as symptoms of fatigue.  -Sharp shooting pains in the abdomen, right side. These come and go and sometimes donât occur for months at a time.  -Once or twice in the past year I have had a strange tingling in the legs, that have lasted for a few days and then completely disappeared.  As this ghost would play tricks on anyones mind, I have in the past 3 months started to try different approaches. I have tried;  -cutting out caffeine, alcohol, sugars completely (teetotal for 3 months now) -eating 5 small meals per day instead of 3, to maintain blood glucose levels -have tried quitting exercising, changing exercise times, all to no avail -I have tried taking an antihistamine (phenergan (as per doctors suggested)) 7 days in a row to âresetâ and they work but I do not want to live my life on sleeping pills, for obvious reasons. -I have taken b12, multivitamin, and magnesium supplements for a few months to no avail -as mentioned above, i practice sleep hygiene -meditation  I have been to a GP 4 times (the first time, I was prescribed sleeping pills mentioned earlier, the second and third time I was discounted with âoh you are young and healthy, you are fineâ (despite no questions being asked about my general health)).   The fourth time under a new GP, my doctor suggested to test liver and kidney function, and white/red bloodcell tests, all of which came back fine.  This most recent GP and I then agreed to try CBT (currently on a 3 month waiting list).  What I am asking is, would anyone qualified or not, have any idea whatsoever what should be my next steps. I do understand the immense drain on the NHS and so each time I use the services I feel very guilty, and am made to feel guilty by my GP. I am not a hypochondriac in the least, however anyone could agree the sudden onset of the aforementioned would make anybody question their physical health.  Thank you very much for your time 
Hi all, I'm worried about someone I know. This person is an insomniac and has been for quite a while. Though every now and then, this person will get a good nights rest and yet the next morning wake up feeling sick, feeling feverish and having cold shakes. I'm so worried. This individual is also a smoker but slowly quitting. Could it be possible this is a virus or something?  Thank you x  
I can't remember precisely when i startes to have problems going to sleep but I think it was when I started a new study (I'm 20 yo). I didn't like the study so i started getting stressed. I quit the study and after that I've been in and out of a job. I had nights where I didn't sleep at all, my brain would just go beserk once I got into bed. I started smoking weed before going to bed which helpted me get to sleep but I never slept calmly. I quit weed after 7 months of smoking each day. I just cant seem to get 1 good night of sleep now and some nights (like last night) I have nothing to be stressed about but when I go to bed my brain just cant stop thinking about stuff, its like a storm. Ive tries melatonin pills bit it doesnt help, ive tried reading aswell. I was thinking about suicide, just thinking about it I would.never do it, since I got sleep problems. I have huge blue red circles around my eyes which make me ashamed. Im healthy and go to the gym 5 times a week.  My mind is cloudy most days. Sorry for ramblind I just got out of bed and have to work soon which makes me want to.jump in front of a train but I dont know what to do anymore. Im not particularry stressed anymore so thats not a reason for me not to sleep, I just want 1 night of good sleep. Theres alot more to it I mainly wantes to vent and see what people think. English is not my 1st language sorry.  
It does not happen that often. I can only think of 3 times, but there are likely more.   I fall asleep and have a dream. I then try to wake from the dream and find myself in bed. I then end up back in the dream and cannot move and things go black or I see somehting, sometimes I feel my body being pulled or frozen in place. I have to pull myself out of the dream again and it takes me a few tries before I am full free. what the hell is this? 
I stared taking Valerin root as I had read that it can help to relax you and help get you to sleep. I feel a lot less tired during the day but still not sleep, spending hours awake at night. I have been told to try 5-HTP which is also supposed to help with sleeplessness, does anyone know if it would be same to try taking both th Valerian & 5-HTP at the same time in the hope of getting some decent nights sleep. 
For 2 months now I have been taking 3.5mg Zopiclone to get to sleep and now I would like to come off these tablets and  go to sleep naturally.  Any advice can you give to enable that to happen.  Normally without medication I can doze watching the 10pm news then when I go to bed nothing, I just cannot drop off, which after a week or so I then go into being anxious mode and it ends up as a viscious circle. 
Okay, so for a while now i have been having trouble waking up, so i asked my little brother to wake me before he leaves to school. Now he swears that he wakes me up and that i talk to him and make eye contact but i never remember this and end up waking up at 10 - 12 and end up not going to school... help please  
Can under 16s buy valerian from boots in the UK? 
Wondering if anyone can help. Constantly feeling sick. Never actually sick. Always have a sharp pain in left hand side of stomach. Can only walk so far before end up having dizzy spells.  
Hi everyone. So for months now I've been struggling with a terrible sleep schedule. Usually I am awake until 3-4am and will sleep, telling myself to wake up at 8am to fix my schedule, and I end up up at 1-2pm. I feel tired and exhausted when I do, and still feel like I need more sleep. I believe I've been struggling with Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder and its affecting my quality of life. My problem is I cant force myself to sleep earlier because it wont work, ill end up laying there awake until 3am and then waking up on and off all the time after I do sleep, then unable to wake up in the morning. I want to be on a schedule to sleep at 12am and wake up at 8am but i just dont know how to get myself there. Waking myself up earlier is near impossible. I dont work or have school so i have no reason that forces me up at 8. I need help. Its depriving my quality of life and i want it fixed. Ive considered staying up all night to reset my clock but I just want opinions and help from others who maybe have overcome this problem as well. Thank you. 
Hello, my name is Kenny and I'm a 23 year old male. Recently, when I start going to sleep late ( around 1 in the morning), in the middle of the night, I suddenly jolt up and try to grab my right numb hand with my left. During that time, it feels as if some kind of creature was trying to run away from me and I was trying to grab it. After a minute or two of grabbing my hand, I calm down, collect my thoughts and go back to sleep. Has anyone ever experienced this? This never happens when I sleep at around 11 pm or earlier, only when I sleep late.  Thank you, Kenny 
never thought I would need to seek help off others who are in the same boat but I do..... I'm scared and worried all the time about thoughts I really don't want to think!!! Now I tell myself I can't sleep.... And I don't!!! Sometimes NO sleep all night!! I lie there thinking scary thoughts and sweating dreading the next day of work!! I have my own business and 2 young children and just want to live my normal happy life that I used to have!!! I'm a mess and feel I've lost the plot and will never get back to normal! It depresses me but refuse to take meds! I used to take sertraline and zopiclone but didn't think they helped!! I've just purchased the effortless sleep method by sasha Stephens so fingers crossed it helps!! Just knowing people experience the same actually helps ( hate feeling so tired and anxious every day ( 
Hello ive been awake for almost 48 hours i try to sleep but no luck i take 3mg of melatonin and that also did not work is this normal?Will i eventually fall asleep i need some advice please 
Hey guys, I'm 20 years old and have been getting night terrors for 5 years, after my brother passed away. A few nights a week I wake up and see someone standing in my room. I've had a boyfriend for 2 years now and they stopped when he first started sleeping over. But they've come back, and now I get one every night. My boyfriend says i wake up and tell him someones in the room, with a terrified look on my face. Last night I saw a corpse looking old woman flying towards me at full speed. I screamed at the top of my lungs and was shaking very bad. Today I noticed a part of my hair looks like it was ripped out and my scalp hurts. I feel very scared and confused, and don't like going to sleep. Is there anything I can do to stop these?  Thanks, Mikaela 
I am a 59 year old retired lady. I recently went "Cold Turkey" ( a month ago) to come off Tramadol which I had become addicted to as I had been taking it for pain for several years, they did nothing for the pain but gave me a "high". I have not been a very good sleeper for many years but now find I seem to feel constanlty Tired even first thing in the morning. Everything I do seems to be such a effort, I'm exhaulsted all the time. Has anyone any suggestions as to what I can eat/drink to give me a daily boost of energy which is what I am lacking. Blood test have shown nothing untowards so I am at a loss as what to do. I walk quite a lot as I have a dog but quite frankly if it wasn't for him I'd happily not leave the house. Thanks for any sensible advice. 
I struggle to fall asleep at the best of times but I have to wake up early for work and live on a busy noisy street with drunk people singing, shouting, screaming outside on their way home. I usually wear foam earplugs to block out the noise but they've started to make my ears sore and it's not bearable to have them in so I'm not able to block out the sound. I've also had an ear infection and blocked ears as a result of using earplugs!   I've tried silicone earplugs but didn't get along with them, couldn't get them to mould right and usually they'd end up getting stuck in my hair lol.  So I was basically wondering does anyone know of any products that wrap around your ear and block out noise, as opposed to earplugs that go into your ear? Kind of like what builders wear but that would be comfortable to sleep in! 
Hello everyone,  I've suffered sleeping issues my entire life, but up until recently this has only effected the time it takes for me to sleep. However, in the past couple of days, it both takes me forever to sleep and I am waking up during the night. I often wake up at 5am after falling asleep at 3am and can't get back to sleep at all. I'm currently so tired that I can barley think. I arrived at uni about four or five days ago and my registration for the GP hasn't been accepted yet so I can't get any proper sleeping pills as of yet. I was wondering if it would be okay to take 100mg of Diphenhydramine and 10mg of Melatonin together to help me get to sleep as well as stay asleep. Is this safe/will it work (as in keep me asleep)?  Thanks. 
Hey everybody. I've been dealing with chronic fatigue, muscle soreness, lack of appetite, and "foggy mindedness" for two years. I never feel good, I feel terrible in the morning, and sometimes it's hard for me to even get up a flight of stairs. I am only 19 years old so age is not a factor here. I have had several blood panels ran and all of them came back negative, including lyme disease. I had a sleep study done and while I slept consistently the entire night, I never entered REM sleep. I am on no prescription medications and I was on none at the time of my study. My mom had a similar symptoms 20 years ago, but the major difference was that she would actually wake up every two hours. She was prescribed an anti depressant called Amitriptyline to help her sleep and it cured her of all of the symptoms. I've spoken to my doctor about allowing me to try the same drug and am waiting on a response from him, but I was wondering if anyone has heard of this. 
My insomnia started about 2 months ago, and except for a few nights, I rarely get more than 2 hours sleep at a time, maybe 6 hrs/night but only if I use a small dose lorazapam (.25).  Ive tried melatonin which didnt make much difference for me.  I can usually fall asleep, but cannot stay asleep.  1)  Is there any hope that this will resolve itself?  Has anyone returned to a normal sleep pattern once this insomnia sets in for months?  2) Has anybody tried magnesium or amino acids (ie. l-tryptophan), and if so, did they help at all, any better than melatonin for example?  3) I tried Ambien years ago, but hated the groggy day after.  A new drug named Belsomra is being released soon, has anybody heard if this drug could be more effective with fewer side effects?  Thanks!   
I have always had issues when it comes to sleeping in one way or another. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression on multiple occasions and paranoia and other mental issues run in my family.  Usually I do not struggle to get to sleep it's the staying asleep that is the problem. A lot of the time I am waking up because I'm "dreaming" that I am late for work or that I've fallen asleep serving a customer (from my house?) It actually takes me a minute or two to figure out that I am infact in bed. If I am not dreaming of work I'm convinced there is someone in the room with us. I wake up seeing shadows leaning over me or my partner and I lash out at it only to wake up or to sometimes find I am already awake.  I'm not sure what I can do about this situation but I find I'm always tired and lack energy. 
My pharmacist recommended NYTOL OTC medication. Luckily in Canada is is very inexpensive. Just $8.50 for 20 pills  I use it on a regular basis and am very compliant.  I even get some beautiful dreams since taking it. What a blessing.  If your pharmacy doesn't carry it in stock they can order it for you. That was the case for me. It only took 3 days for the drug store to get it for me.  If you do try it, get back to me after a week of using it. I'm sure it will make a differenmce. 
Its been almost two months since i had a good night sleep..Since then, i'm lucky if i can have 2 to 3 continous hrs of sleep..I tried relaxing myself, followed some techniques and even meditate. but with no help..my mind is so hyped up thinking about almost everything..i need to have a good night sleep because i'm working as a senior lecturer, how can i perform well in front of my class if i'm like this?? I just had this bad experience recently, something personal.. Is there any over the counter meds for at least makes me relax? 
I am always really tired and feel i have no engery especially during the late afternoon and dont fully feel awake until around midnight. I was wondering if my sleeping pattern is the reason for this. I am on and off the computer pretty much all day and i dont usually stop until i go to bed between 2 - 3am then i usually force myself to wake up between 10:45 and 11am. I seem to be getting enough hours sleep but i feel worse in a morning then i did before i went to bed. Do you think this could be due to my sleeping pattern? 
I am currently taking sleeping tablets  zopiclone in the lowest dose and I am geting drug induced sleep but I have done this for3 weeks now. I dislike taking tablets at the best of times and I am aware of the ever reducing returns. I walk the dogs for 2 hours every day and excercise every other day. I meditate daily. I am in quite a pressurised job but this has never bothered me. Any advise is appreciated. 
How many here use C-PAP machine. I mean really use them. 
Plz help I've suffered for 10 years but only got diagnosed 3 months ago I'm on 60 mg of duluxitine at night also 80mg of MST morning and night and when I'm at my worst oramorph but at the moment the worst thing apart from pain is no sleep I've been given 2x zoploclone at night so over 7mg nothing any advice or help would be gratefully aprciated I wore with all my meds as I'm only 34 thanks  
I only get 2hours sleep a night. Sometimes no sleep at all. Ive gone from a happy person to a very sad person who has not much energy and cant think straight the next day. I dont even feel like talking to people at work..It is down to guilt at something i did at work which i cant fix. I now have a weak bladder as well so need toilet all the time as when i drink it goes through me in a few hours, also have stomach pains like nots. Ive also lost weight Im at my wits ends, not sleeping has made me want to kill myself which i think about most days and google it. 
I am wondering if anyone out there could give me any feedback on this. 
I honestly feel like I've tried everything. I'm 19 years old and I've had sleeping issues for years. I've been given so much different things by the doctors because the normal solutions weren't working. At the moment I'm taking Zolphidem (10mg each night) however they're making me fall asleep but I'm back into my constant bad pattern of sleeping during the day, making it extremely difficult for work, mostly having to go to work without sleep.  These tablets are also having huge side effects with memory loss that night (I've done things that I don't remember, things that can put me in danger) however at the same time, I can't sleep without them and it's been an issue for a long time.  I'll stay up all night for example (even if I'm lying in bed trying to sleep) not being able to rest and fall asleep. I found that without tablets I don't sleep at all that night and will normally attempt to fall asleep between 10pm-12am however would end up giving up after still being awake between 2-3am. I'd eventually get so tired that I'll fall asleep around 5isham.   At the moment I'm going to bed around 8am. I sometimes skip nights due to it and then compensate. Some people have said "do some excercise" however even if I went to the gym or excercised for an hour, it doesn't matter. My issue isn't being tired, I could be extremely tired and still not sleep.   I'm just sick of being in this pattern as it really lowers your mood and it's having an effect on my relationship as well. The issues caused me a lot of hassle with school, causing my grades to drop in my second year of A-levels as the sleeping got worse, and now causing issues with work and other activities. I normally get prescribed sleeping tablets by the doctor however they tend to stop working after a while, which seems to be happening with the zolphidem as I'm back to a bad pattern. They normally then switch my tablets or increase my dosage.  
I am 20 years old and a sufferer of extreme ocd and intrusive thoughts the latest instrusive thought as taken me for one heck of a ride and i dont know if i can recover its been that bad. The thought randomly entered my mind what if i can never sleep again. Then went online read about visuale and auditory hallucanations even pyschosis from not sleeping it has driven me off the wagon im not going to lie. My mind keeps telling me that i wont sleep and will go crazy and have to be put in a pysch ward the thought is stressing me out to no end and i dont know what to do. I read a story of someone who died from being awake for 72 hours and that drove me to even more stress. Is it physically possive for a normal person to just stay awake until they die from anxiety cause thats my biggest fear at this point.  
Why do I always kick and punch while asleep? Sometimes even when I'm half awake and I can't control my legs and arms jerking and twitching. Is this part of something or serious? Should I see a doctor? 
I have never been a good sleeper but in the last few months my sleep has just gone down through  the gutter. Back in May I was averaging over 9 hours of sleep per night but now I am lucky to make 6.  Yes I have had a double whammy of suffering from depression and my mum was diagonosed with terminal cancer back in April but particularly in the last month I am finding that I get into bed but it's well after midnight before I settle down and now waking up regularly between 6 and 7 and unable to get back to sleep..becoming a regular listener to R5 live breakfast show..  Any advise will be most welcome 
My question is how melotinin production get interrupted for people sleeping after 3 AM and what does it mean to the normal function of pineal gland? Should I take melotinin production boasting OTPs as as a night  owl?  I only sleep after 3 as my current living conditions demand that I stay awake until then to get work done at peace and quietness. As a result, I am asleep at least until noon. I don't have any sleep problems. Once I sleep, then I get a good 'day' sleep and function normally.    
I've been having sleep paralysis for as long as i can remember.  i remember having it when I was little, I am now 22 and wonder if sleep paralysis is actually normal?  i've never told a doctor about this/  
Would like advice on sleep disorders,what kinds are they and what medication has people used and have they worked! Insomnia for 18 years! Thanks  
my husband told me that I often Stop breathing for quite long periods during the night. He says almost a minute! Then I do a loud gasp and start breathing again. I am not snoring at all, I don't smoke, am a very light drinker and am not tired during the day. Could this be sleep apnea ? 
It's 4.10am and I've just woken from what seems like hours of sleep paralysis (bit was probably a couple minutes). Always accompanied by a bizarre vivid dream and what seems like levitation. This time I sat up and flew backwards out of my window up into the night sky. (I know I didn't actually but it reaaaaally feels like I did). I wish I was joking because I literally cannot right now. Why is this happening?!!!!! 
I don't know what's wrong, I have rarely woken up from any dream so scared before. I'm not even sure if I had a nightmare or if I was just dreaming, I don't remember anything about my dream. I just woke up and I was terrified, I don't know why. But I ran to my parents room screaming and I was psychicaly shaking.  I'm 17 and I do have trouble getting to sleep, it takes a few hours for me to fall asleep, I have had nightmares but I don't understand what this is. I'm just to scared to sleep now.  
During the summer I have started a habit of staying up late watching Youtube videos and that sorta stuff. I have to go back to school this two weeks from now and I have been trying to go to bed earlier.  Unfortunetly, I toss and turn for about two hours and can not fall asleep until three. I'm definetly going to lose a lot of energy and mental power if I cant fall asleep at a decent time.  Please let me know how I can finally fall asleep earlier. 
I am new to this forum and have signed up out of sheer desparation so I do apologise for the essay.....  I am a 27 year old female, 5"3 and around 8st11 in weight, usually a size 6 to 8. This may seem relevant later on....  For the last 14 nearly 15 years I have been struggling with severe exhaustion which only seems to be getting worse and I am stuck in a terrible chicken-and-egg situation.  When I was 13 I started to feel tired. My mum, thinking that it might be because I had started my periods took me to the doctors for anaemia tests, these came back negative. Thinking it was me being a teenager nothing more was really done about it until I was 15, again the tiredness continued and various other tests were performed but to no avail. Around about this time I started to get depressed (again put down to one of the gripes of being a teenager).  Around 17/18 I started taking caffiene tablets to feel more awake (pro plus) and visited my doctor about six months later to explain I felt exhausted and could not live without the caffiene tablets. I believe as a result of this I started suffereing with anxiety and panic attacks. This anxiety lasted until I was about 19, I was scared to drink alcohol, smoke or do any recreational drugs as I had developed an obsession about being sick in public. I note that by this point I had been taking the depo provera shot injection as a form of contraception and no longer got periods so the tiredness could not be attributed to loss of blood.  Around that time I visited the doctor again about feeling tired and was tested for all kinds of things, when these came back negative I remember clearly the doctor saying "well some people just get more tired than others" and it was kind of left at that. I was frustrated and felt helpless and did no more about it.  When I met my partner when I was 20, he commented on the amount of caffiene I was taking (20 pro plus a day and around 3 cans of redbull) and noted that I was the only person he knew who could drink a can of redbull and fall asleep immediately afterwards.  When I started staying at his house on a regular basis he noticed that I am a "weird sleeper" something I have known about myself for a long time but never thought of as abnormal. I scream, cry, laugh, talk and do all kinds of weird stuff in my sleep. He said perhaps the reason I was feeling tired was maybe because of that and suggested I spoke to my GP.  Insistant that there was nothing more they could do after feeling like all those years had been waisted I did not go, and continued with my lifestyle as a normal young woman. I would go out at weekends, enjoy drugs recreationally, drink, smoke and take the caffiene during the week.  Anyone would think that perhaps my tiredness was a result of lifestyle, right? Wrong. Because I stopped. I stopped smoking, I stopped partying, I started excerising regularly but felt no better. I would sleep and sleep for 12-13 hours and feel terrible still. My dad would joke that I had narcolepsy as I would always fall asleep when I visited him.  Eventually at 23 I went back to the doctors and explained that the obvious causes of the tiredness (partying, smoking, caffiene etc) had been excluded from my life and that I had this night time activity. She then referred me to a sleep specialist in east grinstead and I've been undergoing tests ever since.  First I had to sleep with a heart monitor at home, this showed that my heart rate fluctuated a lot during the night, they said that something was causing me to become disturbed. They also said this would explain the parasomnias and sleep walking as something is causing me to become disturbed in my deep sleep and my brain is not fully waking up so as a result I am half acting out my dreams in this weird lucid state.  They have put me on various sedating anti depressants (around 3 or 4 different types) but I cannot remember the names of all of them. They also gave me gabapentin for epilepsy in the hope this would do something but nothing, the tablets make me groggy and feel worse afterwards.  They thought initially that I might have had sleep apnea, although I am not overweight my jaw is slightly set back and they thought perhaps this could be a cause. I had to wear a splint to keep my jaw forward which was agony and caused me to feel more tired than I had ever felt before.  They got me in for various sleep studies but the wires and machinerey were suffocating and caused me to stay awake the entire time.  I then was given and oxygen mask thing to wear (a cpap) but this was bad too as I could not drop off to sleep with it on. Frustrated, I returned to them at 26 to say that I was prepared to go for the surgery they had initially offered me which was going to radically change the way I look (breaking and resetting of both jaws, metal pins, braces, loss of nerve feeling) because I was so desparate.   They did one final sleep test in which I did fall asleep only to find my worst nightmare - nothing wrong.  I cried and cried and cried sitting in that doctors chair. As the years go on I feel more and more overwhelmed with exhaustion. Some days I get in and can do nothing but sit, I feel my limbs throbing with exhaustion. I cannot conerntrate, my brain function is terrible, my memory is shocking and only getting worse. I forget how old I am, what year it is, what day of the week it is. I struggle so much to remember what I am expected to do and focus at work that all of my energy is taken up doing this, I get in from work and can do nothing but sit. I am moody, irritable and generally miserable. I also suffer from nausea and upset stomach frequently which often means I am too ill to do anything so I just lay on the sofa feeling rubbish.  As I get older, I am taking the caffiene still (i had to return to this after a six month break) as life is unbearable. I want to exercise but have no energy to do it, I have no energy to do simple household chores and spend my days looking forward to sleep. I sleep for 13-14 hours easilly during the weekends. The doctors now say I might have "idiopathic hypersomnia" and have prescribed me 400ml modafinil 200ml twice a day. in addition to that I take between 6-10 pro plus just to keep me going.  I work in an office, from 9-6pm, I go to bed around 10.30pm although if I can get into bed at 9pm then great and I get up between 6.55am and 7.15am. I have been given discaplinaries at work due to time off but its simply because I am too tired to go in. I have had accidents in my car as a result of my concerntration. I have been told off for being distracted again all because I am tired.  I have lost friends and argued with family, my partner and I split up briefly with my sleep problem being a large factor.  I feel terrible, I feel worn out. The older I am getting the worse I feel, I have just enough energy to get to work and back then possibly cook dinner. Weekends are a no no, I really wanted to go out this weekend but can't as I need to rest so much for work.   I no longer use drugs recreationally, I do not exercise, although I would love to I am too tired and worn out. I feel like I have flu. I am trapped because the caffiene I need keeps me awake during the day but could be making me feel sick, I get deeply miserable, is my life going to be like this forever? If I am getting this bad what will I be like in the future? I am too tired to cook and eat properly which makes it worse. I literally live for sleep and at 27 years old I am very very sad. I look at my colleagues who are younger than me who can have weekends out and be fine for work on Monday, I cannot. I do not drink during the week AT ALL as I do not like alcohol and binge drinking is all rationed depending on how tired I am feeling. I havent seen my best friend for weeks as I get in from work and cancel our plans as I feel so sick and tired.   I get ill frequently, I have good night hygeine and morning rituals to help but nothing ever really takes away from the constant exhaustion. If I get less than six hours sleep a night I am an emotional mess, if I consistently get this (a week or more) I start to lose my mind all together, I start hearing things, seeing things, I think about suicide. I am not me when I am tired, its like I have this devil side that I am constantly trying to keep at bay,  I have to sleep with earplugs in, even though we live in a quiet suburb the drop of a pin will wake me up. I hiccup in the night, I punch my partner in the night. As I write this email I am sporting a black eye as a result of sleep walking into the bed.  I get up CONSTANTLY throughout the night to go to the toilet, I sleepwalk (have done on a few occasions when guests stay and woke up in bed with them) I have been known to do sexual things to my partner in my sleep which really and truthfully as great as that might sound is never appropriate when you are both sleeping.  The constant caffiene does cause paranoia and anxiety and I know this, but I need it, even after cutting it out for a good half a year I felt no better, my sleep did not improve so I figure it doesnt matter.  I get terribly low and depressed because I feel like I have this huge burden that no one understands as its not obvious. People always say "oh yeah I get tired" but they don't know what its like to battle with yourself emotionally every morning to get out of bed. To risk your life driving to work if your concerntration slips just a bit. To struggle to remember things that have been said in meetings and be told off for time off or lack of concerntration. To feel so sick and nauseaous all the time that you can do nothing else but sit. To have aching muscles like the flu. Forget about getting ill, thats a week off work right there. I got sacked from a job I had just started as I became very ill in 2013, I got a chest infection that did not clear despite 3 rounds of antibiotics and inhalers. I was so ill I had to sleep on the sofa as my constant coughing kept my partner up at night, I felt terrible and did not have the physical strength to fight it off. Some days I struggle to string scentences together. I used to be so clever at school and was placed in higher education maths and english as I was so advanced, now my brain is mush. I cannot spell properly, I cannot remember things or do basic problem solving as my brain feels thick and heavy. My eyes sting with tiredness most of the time. I am ALWAYS yawning. It not normal I know, I know my lifestyle hasnt helped but this problem started WAY before any of the adult bits and I gave them up a while ago and still I get worse.  I am so tearful and miserable I get depressed, I do not want to carry on living as my life is becoming more and more restricted. I had to change the flights of a holiday recently as I was too exhausted to get to the airport.  Sometimes I feel so tired I feel drunk, like I could pass out at any moment yet the doctors cannot find out whats wrong, surely it cant be that hard with so many obvious symptoms?  I am due back to sleep centre for one more test for Narcolepsy, they are throwing around the idea of amphetamines as a daily medecation which I do not want, the caffiene is bad enough amphs will be so much worse. What will happen to my heart? Will I be able to have healthy children? Its a nightmare and I am absolutely sick and tired of being sick and tired!  
Hi everyone,   Posted on here a couple of times about my anxiety / depression and how I'm trying my hardest to get over it. Which I still am!   I'm finding myself very confused about a lot of things, as if I am unsure of what's reality and what's all in my head. The worst case of this is within my relationship. I've been with someone off and on for 3.5 years. The relationship has been off and on due to him changing his mind about me all the time. I'll try to nutshell the situation:   I have 2 children from a previous relationship. Their father does not help in any way and has minimal contact.  I have also looked after my cousin since he was 10 (now 17) with no help from his parents either.  I am an only child and have to do a lot to take care of my parents who are divorced, lonely and not too healthy now that they're getting older.  I have been suffering with severe anxiety and depression for well over 10 years but try to deal with it by myself without it impacting on those I care about. I mostly seeking professional help and have tried several medications.  My eldest child has autism and my youngest is due to undergo assessments for Asperger's syndrome.  I have no job or career and my future prospects seem non existent BUT I am intelligent and capable. I guess I am just lost, overwhelmed and just don't know what to do to make life better for everyone but I know it's ME who has to change everything.   The guy I am with tells me all the time that I  am not doing enough, that I should be out there trying to earn more money (where is "there"?) as he is trying to start his own businesses and thinks I should be doing the same.  He still lives at home with his parents, has no responsibilities and has had help from his parents to start his businesses, none of which have been greatly successful. But I have always supported him and never ever put him down when things haven't worked out for him. He tells me that he doesn't want to work hard in order to support children that are not his and that he will want to spend his money going off and doing things he wants to do, travel etc and not have to pay for us too. Bearing in mind that I have NEVER asked him for anything ever. In fact, I have my own house, car etc and have been the one that has provided for him many a time! He says that in the 3+ years he's known me I haven't moved forward or achieved anything. That I should find a cash job to add to money the government gives me (which is illegal) so that I have more and can buy a new car, take kids on holiday etc. he tells me that I always have a problem with everything he does - it's not that I have a problem it's just that I feel unsettled and insecure I this relationship so I guess that's true. He often a uses the words "why can't you just...?" "I don't get why you're not like...." And stuff like that.   I am confused by what he says to me. He says all these nasty things and then seems happy when I am basically crushed and feeling completely worthless. Why doesn't he just leave me if I am such a loser? I don't understand how someone can continuously hurt another human being and be okay with it, happy with it! Especially when you're meant to love that person. He always says sorry, that he was wrong, shouldn't say such things but then does it over and over again. He goes on about how attractive I am and says he can't stay away from me for that reason only. How does that make sense? How can I possibly be attractive/sexy when I have practically no self esteem at all what so ever?   If anyone has been through this sort of thing I'd really appreciate some feedback. There's more to what he does to me but I've tried to summarise. I'm just so confused and feeling like if he's right about me I am a complete waste of space who doesn't deserve to be loved. But if he's wrong, then surely he is a very mean person. I just don't know anymore. Help.  
Im an 18 year old female and i have been suffering since January. I came down with some sort of illness which i still find hard to describe! I had an extremely high temperature, I wasnt able to stand or move properly, I became very weak, my heart rate was extremely high and my blood pressure was very low. My local doctor immediatley sent me into A&E where i was kept for about 12 hours on a drip, but when the doctor couldn't figure out what was wrong I was sent home with a ton of antibiotics (which did nothing!). It took me almost 2 months to recover enough so that i could get back into a somewhat normal routine and return to finish my school exams. However since the illness I am constantly fatigued and cannot stop sleeping. I sleep from about 10pm-8am and then when i return home i sleep again for another 3/4 hours and fall asleep once more at 10pm. I find it extremely hard to get through the day and it is really holding me back. Ive had several blood tests ran which all came back clear, i also went for an MRI scan as ive been having muscle weakness and fatigue but that also came back clear. Im at my wits end and to be totally honest i feel like my doctor just doesn't care anymore! Has anybody experienced anything like this or have any advice as to where i can go from here. Thank you! 
Hi. I'm 52 and have no history of sleep problems. In fact I generally sleep through anything. That is until seven weeks ago today. I went to bed as usual, but didn't get to sleep till about four in the morning. The same thing happened the next night and the next etc etc. sometimes I'll go to sleep quickly but wake up a couple of hours later- just for a bit of variation ha, ha. The thing is, I'm pretty certain what caused this, but it makes me sound a bit pathetic. There's a woman at work who I've become quite friendly with. Just friends I must stress and she has given no indication that it is anything more. Anyway, I had a week off work and the night before my first day back I started to get butterflies in my stomach and realised I was excited about seeing this woman the next day. That's the first night I didn't sleep. I became quite infatuated for a couple of weeks, but that intensity seems to be wainiing now. However, I'm still left with the insomnia. I must stress that this type of schoolboy crush iscompletely out of character. She has a partner an so do I - 20 years now I wouldn't want to do anything to ruin it. Any thoughts Advice would be most welcome. Thanks. 
Does anybody else get a feeling of an adrenalin rush when falling asleep? I'd feel perfectly fine and then as soon as I start falling asleep all of a sudden I get this weird feeling my heart starts pounding, not fast just heavy, as if someone scared the hell out of me. But, as soon as I actually fall asleep I usually have no problem staying asleep and I sleep fine. Anyone else experiencing this? 
Before I alway go to sleep at 3am. Now, I try to listen stories audio at bedtime, I think it OK (youtube/channel/UCeaXBVPpxvSXuUu1aX6Rzeg) 
As you know , (if your in the northern hemisphere) summer is coming to a close soon and school is right around the corner. I've been sleeping rather late (like 3 AM) and waking up very late (12-3PM). I've always had a hard time falling asleep , it usually takes me at least an hour to sleep. So when school starts , I know I'm gonna have a hard time falling asleep. I need to have a new sleep pattern , and fast because I can't afford to go to sleep at 3 , because I have to wake up at 6:30AM for school. So if you guys have any tips for me to start a new sleep cycle , please tell me! 
i have nightmares everytime I fall asleep. They often wake me up. At night or whenever I officially lay down for bed I wake up pa bout four or five times. My heart is always pounding when I awaken from nightmares. I am very tired in the AM I breath fast when I am sleeping(boyfriend made me aware of this). I do not snore. I used to kick and punch in my sleep as a kid. I do have a lesion in my brain.  i have c spine lesions not sure if it has anything to do with my sleep.  
Hi  I have had a severe sleep problem for 4 years now which started with an  episode where I woke up from a weird dream with my heart racing out of control.  It scared me so much I had a panic attack and then developed panic attacks night and day.  Fast forward 4 years and I am still having nightmares a few times a night and am still waking up with my heart pounding and occassionally it races very fast, it is as if I wake up in a complete and utter fright.  I have been to the doctors many times about this and have had heart tests including 24hr ECG  which was normal apart from a missed beat and heart pounding at nigh which apparently was due to me having a bad dream, not the heart itself.  I tried beta blockers but gave up because they made me feel absolutely awful but they did stop my heart pounding at night but I still felt the anxiety.  My dreams are really frightening and they always start of pretty benign but get really bad towards the end and then I wake up in a complete fright feeling really disorientated.  I have also occassionally woken up feeling like I can't breathe but my doctor said that it was anxiety.  I just want to get to the bottom of what is causing this but I've had no joy with going to the doctors and one doctor just told me to set my alarm really early before I go into dream sleep!  My sleep problem is really affecting my mood and I feel really down and I still have an anxiety problem.  I dread going to bed because I know that when I've closed my eyes the next thing I know will be waking up from some horrendous nightmare.    I would be most grateful for any help and advice on what could be causing my severe nightmare problem, is it possible for anxiety to cause nightmares all night, every night?  I'm getting close to going back to the doctors but how are they going to stop me dreaming?  I wish I could go to a sleep clinic, get it sorted out and be able to live a normal life again.  I'm seriously considering not going to bed anymore because I can't bear the nightmares but I know I can't do that really.  Please help.   
Before i would sleep at 6am and wake up at 2pm, now i've managed to fix my sleeping patern and im now sleeping at 10pm and waking up at 5am.  The problem is, im now super tired all day, so tired it feels like i could sleep on the spot. Is this normal? and how long can i expect this to last before i feel normal again? 
I get it quite a lot but last night was the most disturbing ever. I felt like I was being lifted up and could see the bed beneath me. It freaked me out so much. Before I fell asleep I posted on here about feeling suicidal - something I'm battling with. Can the two be linked. Is sleep paralysis something that gets worse with deteriorating mental health? Any advice / experiences would be much appreciated as I am now freaking OUT and petrified to sleep. Thanks. Bird.  
It started last night, I went to sleep at around 10 (a bit early but I was tired) and woke up at about 1. I just looked around for a bit but as I moved my head I heard the sound of a man speaking very loudly, I could even make out the words he was saying. It startled me so much that I started to scream before I stopped myself.  After that I kept nodding in and out of sleep, during one of the dreams I had there was a very sudden and loud sound in it but it didn't wake me up at first, but it happened several more times before I finally did wake up. I didn't note the time but I went back to sleep and woke up again at 3, this time I saw moving things and heard the voice of a woman speaking slowly grow louder as I got more awake before it was almost unbearably loud (once again, I could make out words). This time I just rolled over and waited for everything to stop. The voice ended up fading before suddenly being interrupted by the very loud noise of a car engine. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night.  Now it has started to happen again last night. I was really tired from not sleeping enough so I went to bed at 10 again and ended up being woken up by more loud sounds just a couple hours later.  I really don't think I can take much more of this. I had my first visual hallucination after waking up a couple weeks ago so I assume it has something to do with a routine I have or something I am doing but I just want to sleep. 
I have trouble sleeping before a big event so have been trying valerian root tea it seems to help me drift off but then I wake an about an hour later startled & unable to go back to sleep. On normal nights I have no trouble sleeping any ideas or suggestions please? 
Hi All  I have not had a good night sleep in over 20 years. I am female 45 yeras old. I have had pains in my body and also have night sweats.  Where I have been only just diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in Aug 2014 and also  I know I am not going through my Menopause, I just can't get a good night sleep.  I don't like to take meds but have tried in the past and also have tried herbal remedies.  I also have tried with having a bath before going to bed, as well as having a milky drink before going to sleep.  I have also had CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy) which helps with mindfulness and breathing techniques but just can't get my sleep.  Can anyone please give me advise to get some sleep ?  Thank you in advance..... x 
Has anyone any knowledge on Sleep Apnea? I have been diagnosed with this condition and have an appointment at the sleep clinic at the end of August. 
Hi, I've been recomended to read a book countless times, as usually I go on my phone which I know doesn't help but the problem is I've got no light at bedtime (Sleep on the floor in my mum's room - Can't sleep in my own bed) so would a phone flashlight that's close to my face showing me the words for the book be a bad thing or good?  
This is the third time this has happend and I don't understand it. I wake up in the morning and can't remember what time of day it is, have I woken from a nap? is it morning or night? This morning I woke up feeling it was evening and it was 6.45 in the monring. I am really worried about this wondering if I could have demencia etc. I am hypothyroid and have Graves and Hashimotoes, would it be anything to do with thyroid? I am an intelligent person who likes to keep busy. The only thing I can credit it to was perhaps an upsetting argument with my husband last night, but as I say it's happened a few times now. Any help would be good. 
I have had insomnia for years, but it had gotten worse the past few months and to the point where I coudn't go to sleep at all. I finally tried the smallest dosage of melatonin and it worked. I used melatonin a few times and found other things that work too, chamomile tea, Valerian capsule, magnesium, etc.. My problem is that when I do get a few hours of sound sleep, I feel a sense of mental detachment the next day. it feels awful. Any idea why I feel this? Some call it depersonalization? 
My 12 year old daughter will not sleep. We give her melatonin, and within a week her body has learned to fight it away. We dont want to do anything to her, she is always awake. I dont know how to help. 
Hi everyone. Please don't judge straight away after I mentioned marijuanna. This is a terrifying experience and I'm not sure what is happening to me.  Basically, i had a joint with my friends. Please note - I have only smoked weed a few times in the past and I am not addicted to the drug. After the joint I started having heart palpitations and visual hallucinations. These hallucinations were terrifying and i thought i seen a man in the mirror with no face.   On this trip everytime i was falling asleep, right before i fell asleep, it was like a surge of energy was sent to my brain because i thought my heart was stopping.   This sensation of my heart 'skipping a beat' has occured every single night since I had the joint. I phoned the hospital and got took in late on the second night after the joint, because I was very tired and this sensation was not allowing me to sleep. I also had a mild headache and chest pains. I got my BP and HR taken, both were abnormal. I got kept in and put on an ECG. I was allowed out in the morning because my blood test etc came back normal. I am still having these issues and it has been over a week.   LAST NIGHT however, was TERRIFYING. I had these symptoms and started feeling frustrated because I was at a friends house. But I experienced a terrifyingly strange bout of Lucid Dreams. There was one in particular which was sort of demonic, like there was a screaming face in my full field of vision which caused me to wake up. I also expanded my chest at one point, like I was being possesed and a strong bright light was at my chest.There was a less terrifying one where I was unable to sit up or speak or move, but I could see the dog lying beside me.There was also a dream which was like my spirit was being extracted from my body and a strange dying feeling went through my full body, but i woke up because this happened about 2 times. This sensation was a pleasant feeling but when i woke up i was extremely terrified.   I have also noticed a burning sensation at the back of my neck, sharp pains in my head, slurring of words, struggle to remember things through out the day and weakness throughout my body.   I was a very healthy 18yo girl before this happened, with no history of heart issues.  Please help me I am terrified that one night will be too much and it will cause a heart attack or something similar.  Thanks so much! 
When I'm in bed trying to go to sleep, I often get a sort of loud "bang" in both ears, followed by a mild electric shock down my arms, which leaves my fingers slightly tingling.   I thought this would be cured when I had a C5/6 bone fusion, but it hasn't gone away.   It isn't pain at all, hence I'm reluctant to see a G.P. as I've had bad experiences from them.  Anybody out there with similar symtoms?     It only ever happens in bed.   Thanks. 
Hello,  I have had occurences of a certain sleep type (mostly when younger) and recently found out that I share this with direct blood family memebers; the occurence isnt frequent but it is very strange and I would like some help and answers if anyone can provide them.  The occurence happens the second I close my eyes, the second I close my eyes they seem to only be closed for a few seconds (like a long blink) before the next thing I know, Its morning and I am up, wide awake, and fully rested.  The basic explanation is that I blink at night and wake up in the morning fully rested.   This makes NO sense to me, I havent been able to find answers online or anywhere.   Thanks Again and Excuse my English, J.S. 
Iâve been having sleep problem EVERY SINGLE night for the past ten years, literally. I have no understanding, no cure for it nor does my doctor, a neurologist. It started one night in early 2003 when I was trying to sleep. What felt like an intense and focus jolt of vibration that is usually associated with electrocution struck the back of my head and shook my entire skull inside and out. It then went on sporadically throughout the entire night during sleep. It kept me from falling asleep at first and when I did fall asleep; it hit my head again and woke me up. It happened easily four, five times a night. I felt completely exhausted, worse than before I went to bed the previous night, when morning came eventually and I had to get up and go to work. That was how it started.  This same pattern of debilitating sleep interruption described above has been continuing to this date, ten years later, just as it will happen again tonight and tomorrow night and the night after. What had changed in the meantime were the frequency, sensation and the positions it hit on my body. The vibration mentioned had gradually changed into a sensation that I could only described as being hit by a solid blunt object, and it got stronger as it dragged on. The worst came one night in 2008 just before Easter. As âusualâ I was trying to sleep when it hit again on the back of my head. But this time it struck about every ten minutes or so at almost the exact moment when I just fell asleep and it felt like someone was physically hitting the back of my head with a hammer. It dragged on for more than an hour. I was in serious pain and my head felt like it was going to explode. I literally lost my mind that night. It was like a physical torture by someone only I was the alone in the room and no one else.  The sensation had changed again since then. It went on to become a powerful âpokingâ as if someone was poking me with a stick or something. It also began to spread all over my body: limps, torso, etc. Sometimes the poking was so powerful that my arm would fly up as if I was having some kind of convulsion; other times this poking sensation became more like âtwistingâ and my neck and head would jerk to left or right involuntarily when it hit. It all happened during my sleep. The pattern was the same. I got woken up four, five times a night during sleep. I still felt utterly exhausted even after spending more than ten hours in bed.  At about the same time, a new sensation was developed in addition. It was a needle pricking like sensation which hit my eyes and ears sporadically. At times I would be woken up by a sharp pain in the eye, and it happened for a long period of time. It was really painful, and the pain could last for hours the next day and it required medical attention. This happened in conjunction with the poking sensation on limps and torso. Also around the same time, this âphysical/sleep disorderâ had started to occur during day time as well when I was working in the office. So I didnât even know if I could still consider it as just sleep problem any more.  I went to visit a neurologist few times about couple years ago in search for an answer and cure and had gone through some examinations such as the EEG. My EEG turned out fine though, but it offered no indication or explanation as to how and what caused all the terrorizing âsymptomsâ I had experienced. It puzzled him a great deal. All he could do was prescribing me powerful sleeping pills and no further treatment was suggested. I gave up after a few visits but the problem persisted.  Until recently, the symptoms such as the sensation of electrocution and poking, etc. have become somewhat less powerful, but the pattern and frequency are pretty much the same. I still suffer every single night. Consequently, in addition to suffering from the most immediate and obvious outcome such as chronic fatigue, physical exhaustion, eye strain, black eye, etc.; Iâve also been suffering from depression like symptoms, nightmares and  frequent powerful migraine like headaches which sometimes makes me unable to go to work in the morning. This negative effect of my sleep problem has gone beyond physical. Iâm desperately trying to find a cure for it but to no avail. TEN year later Iâm still suffering from the same illness day after day, night after night, and there seems to be no end and resolution to it.  I could be alone in the whole world experiencing torturous disorder such as this but I try not to believe it. So if you have (or had) experienced or know someone who have been through similar sleep disorder and recuperated, please do share it with me. I will be eternally grateful. Any suggestions which might point to a possible cure are truly welcomed. Many thanks in advance.    
Hello, I'm writing here in the hope that someone can tell me a little about my problem and whether anyone else has heard/suffered from it. What the issue is, is that as soon as i try to read anything, I fall asleep within a minute or so- guaranteed. I've been looking round the net without much real success and if I could, I will tell you some things that it isn't. I've read various answers/replies and many times it has been said that it must be because you are reading something boring -not true, i struggle to read about things I am really, really really interested in. It doesn't matetr whether i am in bed, at work, sat in the garden...anywhere at any time and within a minute or two of reading, I have fallen asleep. It's driving me up the wall, the doctors are not much use just telling me obvious things like 'get more sleep' 'don't drink too much'....for the record, I am in bed about 10 every night, sleep very well and don't drink alcohol. Besides if it was due to drinking alcohol/caffeine it surely wouldn't happen say, in the morning after a very good sleep and I feel fresh as a daisy...until I read.  What on earth is wrong with me? I'm 49, fit and active. Yet I also had this problem when I was unfit and drank a lot and ate a poor diet...I thought getting healthy and losing weight might have sorted it out but no..  Thanks for listening and I hope someone can help or point me in the right direction.    
I've searched for similar problems for people and all I get is people sitting up in their sleep, or sitting up and talking or screaming. It seems to happen on nights where I struggle to sleep and it's usually early in the morning after I've hardly slept but I find myself shooting up from a laying position and then laying back down over and over again for hours. I'm not fully awake when it's happening but I am defiently not fully asleep either. It used to happen very sparringly but it's been happening more and more this year. I feel as if I have zero control over the situation, like my body just decides all on it's own to do this. It's even more odd to me considering I sleep on my stomach, so it takes a decent amount of effort to flip over and up so quickly without really telling my body to do so. Anyways, if anyone has similar issues or has any suggestions I would like to hear of them because it has begun to bug me more and more that I don't seem to have any control over it. 
I am a 15 year old teenager. I go to sleep at 2am and fall asleep at 3am and usually sleep for about 9-10 hours. Anyway. Will I grow slower going to sleep late at night but still having 9-10 hours of sleep or It will not affect my growth hormones at all as if I went to sleep at 11pm and also slept for 9-10 hours. Growth is the only thing I am worried about but if there are any other bad consequences going to sleep late at night please let me know. Thank you!  
Hi, I've been having a lot of problems sleeping in the last couple of weeks and it seems to have come from just one bad night. I have had to take time off work as I am so exhausted. The anxiety comes in when I can't sleep and I start to get panicky that I will never sleep properly. Are there any positive stories out there to help me feel ok ? I've been given an anti-depressent for the anxiety which I've started taking but I've been told this will take a while to take affect 
i'm getting lots of dreams while sleeping which i can remember after wakeup.so 'm feeling irritated ,tension , tierd and drowsy after sleeping time.something is running in my mind which i cant neglect.to avvoid that i'm counting number to get sleep at everynight hardly.i don know why its like this for me..can anyone suggest good solution or me? 
I have another doctors appointment Thursday but so far they have been pretty useless. They have me on 10mg of Amitriptyline which is doing nothing. I'm hoping someone on here can give me some advice on what to do in my current situation. Let me explain in detail...  Insomnia: A long term problem I reported years ago and feel I still havnt received the correct help I need, it is basically ruining my life. While at work I feel drained of energy, I lack focus and by the time I get home I'm wide awake. I work a 3 shift pattern which for me is impossible to adjust to, this doesn't help my situation. I eat healthy and want to be out doing things, going to the gym etc but can't find the motivation to do so. Stress: Mostly brought on by not sleeping, things that would slightly bother me now enrage me to the point of me wanting to hurt people or destroy things. I'm not sure how long I can suppress the anger.  Depression: A combination of the above. I'm not I violent person and hate feeling that way. I'm finding it impossible to live a normal life, I obviously have to work but despise it because of my condition. It's becoming increasingly more difficult each day. I can't seem to settle down with a girl as my problems always get in the way one way or another. I'm 27 years old and feel I have achieved nothing in my life, the last 4 years have been absolute torture. I need help otherwise I will not live to see age 30. Anxiety: I'm starting to feel very uneasy in otherwise normal situations. Increased heart rate and sometimes nausea. I assume it's down to not sleeping, people have suggested that I'm having panic attacks. Everyone around me knows something is wrong and the very few who actually care are telling me to seek help.  
Hi, I have been dealing with hving bad dreams and vivid dreams most of my life. They all seem so real and I stay so busy in them. If I am awaken due t the dreams it will be a long while before I can fall back to sleep and when I do it will start again, these dreams. Most of the dreams are bad dreams and will wake me in a panic mode and a since of dread, usually sweating very badly and heart beating extremely fast. I just wonder if anyone else experiences this as well and if anyone has found a natural solution to deal with this. Keep in mind I can fall asleep quickly it just once I am asleep its like all this drreaming starts. I have had past experiences with sleep paralysis, although not common, and night terrors, again not common, as well as sleep walking and talking. The issue is becoming more uncontrolable and keeps me unrested and anxieties fill my days due to not being abl to stop thing of all these dreams. Any advice is welcome and mostly apperciated. 
Heya guys! I just wanna share my sleep problem with you, and i'm really hoping that you can give me some great advices.  so ok, this started maybe a year ago or let's say  2 years ago coz it feels like it.. before this sleeplessness began, i felt really weird.. like something unexplainable is happening to me.. like something is controlling me.. my thoughts, my feelings, even my hunger and sleepiness.. i know its crazy, but thats what i felt.. i was always anxious, worried, stressed everything.. but whenever night comes i felt so tired i even wake up late  sometimes.. sometimes i even felt  uncontrollable shakiness too.. so after 2 mos or 3 i went to see a doctor specializing  in psychiatry..he gave me meds a anti-psychotic med and something that would help me get some sleep.. it worked really.. all those weird feelings are gone.. i felt relaxed and worry free.. the only problem now is i find it hard to sleep.. i only get 4 hrs of sleep or sometimes 2 even.. and thats on good days.. sometimes i dont sleep at all.. i just lay in bed and close my eyes but i know im awake.. what should i do? 
So I've just been going to sleep tonight like I was really tired and couldn't me my eyes open and then all of sudden I'm wide awake a few seconds later, does anyone have any idea what's this could thanks, it maybe helpful to note, I suffer fro. Really bad anxiety  
Hello all.. Like many on this forum I have arrived here out of desperation. My condition is similar to some whose tales I have read, so I hope I can get some helpful advice. I'm almost 58, fit and healthy, but I have always napped during the day - it used to be a 20 minute power nap, then I was set for the rest of the day,and was actually quite pleasant. Gradually, the need for the nap increased - I first went to a doctor in 1997, to be told that some people just get more tired than others. After years of severe exhaustion - for instance,if I get up at 7am, I need to sleep by 10 am - I was finally diagnosed with "a form" of sleep apnoea and used the CPAP machine for almost a year. When it didn't work, the clinic didn't consider any other approach, in fact they couldn't wait to get me off their books and refer me back to my GP. That was months ago, and I haven't been back to my GP. I'm despondent about it - anything they do come up with takes months for an appojntment, and then (in my experience) they're so half-hearted about it it's obvious they're just ticking boxes and not really desperate to help me. I tend to be a night bird (shift work all my life) and do stay up late, but even if I go to bed early, (a) I find myself waking up that much earlier and (b) it makes no difference to how quickly my batteries run down the following day.    I have the kind of job where I CAN duck and dive and sneak a nap here and there, but it's s constant battle. Like a junkie who wakes up focused on where his next fix is coming from, I wake up thinking straight away about whether I'm going to be able to get my daytime sleep. I have never had a proper holiday, because day trips and normal enjoyment are out of the question when you have to be within shouting distance of your hotel/bed all the time. Weeks when I am on an early shift are a write-off -  I know that when I get home I will do nothing except have a long, up to four hour, nap and sit in front of the TV. Going out anywhere or having any kind of a social life is but a pipedream. It has put an unbearable strain on many relationships - very few people can live with this condition in  a partner. It rules and ruins my life, and has done so for almost twenty years, my prime years. I have lately been considering acupuncture - does anyone have any thoughts, on that or on any aspect of the above? Many thanks in advance and good health to you all. 
My sleep problems started in January 2013...anxiety based. Started a new job, assosiated the importance of good sleep the night before and i didn't sleep at all for 3 days..and i mean at all. Then followed a period of 18 months where i took Zopiclone to help me sleep on work days a couple of times a week..the days i didn't take it I didn't sleep at all..just lay there all night (none of this ..oh you've slept and didn't realise it..i just didn't sleep...eyes closed..no sleep). When i had no stress of getting up early and had no pressure on my sleep, i.e weekends, i could sleep, although it took hours to drop off.  Then in April 2014 the zopiclone i was taking 2 days a week stopped working. I was in real trouble. I went to the docs..he said try Zolpidem. This worked..but only gave me 3 hours sleep. The anxiety got to me and I stopped sleeping unaided at all. Even on my days off i would lay awake all night. So, I made the decision to stop using sleeping tablets at all..what followed is the bit that doctors find unbelievable and shows what anxiety can do. I went to Poland with my partner and left my sleeping pills in the UK. I didn't sleep for 6 (six) nights...i lay still practically all night...hoping for sleep to come..nothing. I had no energy...exhausted..felt i was not going to ever sleep again..but on the seventh night i slept...4 hours initially and then went back to sleep for another hour..i thought i was cured. Unfortunately it wasn't the case. The next night nothing..then nothing the night after. The next night 4 hours then nothing again, this carried on.. I worked out i slept for 30 hours in 35 days. I returned to the UK went to the doctors and because my blood pressure was way up from its normal levels, she said i should take Zolpidem to ensure i got some sleep. So since last June i have taken Zolpidem every night..i sleep 3 hours..and once per 30 days on average may go back to sleep for an extra 30 minutes but usually going back to sleep is impossible...as if the the mechanism for sleep does not exist. I am now unable to work because of contantly being tired, depressed and anxious. If ever i try to sleep unaided nothing happens. I am so sleep deprived I am worried about losing my congnitive abilities. I never drop off, no day time naps etc...never nod off in front of the tv..something is not right. I got a referral to a sleep clinic..they offered group therapy...discussing how to get a better nights sleep etc...i've done all that...relax before bed, no tv or computers in the hours before bed, exercise (i walk 1 hour per day), milky drink before bed, no alcohol and i don't smoke. So i didn't take it up as this was miles away and was 3 x 1 hour sessions in a group...not a full investigation. So here i am..in a pickle 
I was diagnosed as  having a mild sleep apnea 10 years ago. I tried using a CPAP machine but it did not work out. But after falling asleep I wake up after 2 1/2 hours. After getting back to sleep I wake up again after 2 1/2 hours. This goes on all the time and it is always 2 1/2 hours, regular as clockwork, night after night, year after year. Does anyone have any ideas what is wrong and how to fix it? Graham09601 
more than 7 years I am using psychatric drug to treat chronic innsomnia . mostly my doctors prescribing anti depressant , very rare case i used to take benzodiazepine.let any one tell long term use of psychatric drug will badly effect kidney or liver ? 
Hey my names Darren  I'm 32 & life is pretty tough at the moment  I worry I won't sleep & every night the anxiety is crazy around getting to sleep. Even though I sleep more then most the fear is always there and I seem to be taking more & more meds. I'm prescribed seroquel & I have some zopiclone. Before I got the zopiclone I managed to take 15 100 mg of serequel as I couldn't sleep one night and crashed out about 7am. I was told this was an overdose by the doctor. I'm sitting here so anxious as I keep thinking I won't sleep tonight and will have to go to A&E & be admitted but still the thought of being up the whole night and next day is scaring the hell out of me.  I've done my research and I think my condition is called psychophsyological insomnia. The thought of being up at 4am onwards tonight is so disturbing to me & my anxiety is sky high. I need constant reassurance & I believe the zopiclone won't work as the other weekend I took 3 7.5 mg and was wide awake but did fall to sleep. I'm in such a state at the moment & all i care about is getting to sleep. This has ruined my life & I would appreciate any help for this forum. 
Hi all - I'm sure a few of you can relate to this problem.  After 12 months of on and off sleep problems, I'm currently struggling with very early wake ups again. Even when I'm very tired still, I'll wake up at the crack of dawn and then the thoughts start coming:  'Please go back to sleep'  'Oh no, it's happening again'!  'Why me'?!  'How the hell do I stop this'?!  My problem is that I've gone through life attaching an intense importance to life events that worry me. At the moment it's sleep and lack of.  I do this because of a problem I had up to the age of 15 which severely affected and damaged my self-esteem.  I seem to go through life sub-consciously looking for the new 'albatross'- even when I've get over a problem, I seem to look for the next one. As much as I don't want another one my sub-conscious does!  So here I am, it's midday and as usual I'm exhausted purely because of lack of sleep. I have just started citalopram after a period on fluoxetine as I'm also suffering from depression and anxiety. These two conditions amplified when my sleep problem emerged out of nowhere 12 months ago. Up until then my sleep was relatively normal.  I'm hoping the mindfulness and new SSRI will help me to let this fear go and allow myself to have a happy life. God knows I really want one, but on certain days I wonder what the hell is going on or what I've done to deserve this.  I really wish I could snap out of this like some people can but something won't let me.  It's so damn miserable, I can't tell you. 
I stay awake at night until 2 o'clock in the morning wanting to sleep, and not managing, but when I do fall asleep, I sleep until midday, this isn't normal for me, and I just want ot sleep earlier, it sucks trying to sleep and knowing that makes it harder. I just want help, I am young and new to looking after myself, so please help. 
I have been taking zopliclone for years and I have never had problems before with the dose,but lately I have had to take more so I guess itâs what they call tolerance. I have had to take alcohol as well sometimes to get me to sleep. I feel like my life is spiralling out of control and I desperately need help. I have a good job and I love my children deeply so I need to get out of this for their sake as well.  Please can anybody suggest a help group or help of any kind? 
my 12 year old daughter who is an asthmatic suffered from a chest infection in january of this year. it lasted for around 6 weeks and after 3 courses of different anti-biotics plus a course of steroids it eventually cleared. around 2 weeks before the infection cleared i noticed she was falling asleep quite easily durring daytime hours, at first i wasn't concerned because i thought it was exhaustion due to the chest infection. around 5 weeks ago things got extremely worse , her periods of falling asleep increased [ one day it was 25 times] and she has fallen asleep in public places and collapsed on the street she has even fallen asleep in the shower. cataplexy is another of her symptoms members of her family plus myself follow her everywhere at home because she is constantly falling over. she has had a head scan an EEG plus a ECG and they have come back clear although she hasn't in fact been seen by a neurologist yet. i feel the doctors have been very dismissive of narcolepsy yet from what i have read it can only be diagnosed in a special sleep clinic. can anybody throw any light on this as my family have literally become prisoners in our home
