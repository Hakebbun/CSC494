 Never remembered nightmares or even having them i was told i woke up either yelling or screaming at someone The last few weeks i have been remembering some of nightmares and last one it was very very disturbing and graphic I wish there was a way to stop these nightmares from happening, someone i know takes meds to help them stop but that too has not been working for her. Why does the mind not let go of all the trauma after it has been released as a dream you would think it would stop alreay and not replay over and over each night 
 Apples iOS 9.3 update might help you sleep better By Nicole Bogart, Globalnews.ca January 12, 2016 Apple is known to throw in some pretty useful features when it updates its mobile operating system, from battery improvements to smarter notifications. But with iOS 9.3, the tech giant hopes to give you a better nights sleep. No, your iPhone wont be able to sing you a lullaby, or cuddle you to sleep  but the update will include a new feature called Night Shift, which will change the colours of the light emitted from your device based on the time of day. Night Shift will use your iPhone or iPads clock and geolocation to determine when its sunset. Then it will automatically shift the colours to the warmer end of the spectrum, making it easier on your eyes in the dark. Why will this help me sleep better? Multiple studies have shown that using blue light-emitting devices before bed can affect how we sleep. We know light affects our day-night cycle, or our circadian rhythm, but particularly the short-wave or blue light from cellphones has a strong impact, said Global News medical contributor Dr. Samir Gupta. The light emitted from a smartphone or tablet, for example, can suppress the production of melatonin  a hormone that regulates a persons circadian rhythm. One study, completed in 2014, compared the effects of reading an e-book versus a regular paper book before bed. Those who read on light-emitting devices took longer to fall asleep and had less REM  the stage of sleep you do most of your active dreaming in  than those who read the paper book. The study also found those who read on a light-emitting device took longer to wake up and were sleepier the next day. By transitioning your iPhone or iPads screen to a warmer hue, Apple hopes this new feature will make it easier on your eyes. However, that doesnt mean its a cure. I dont know if the latest changes that Apple is proposing would reduce or illuminate blue light, but I am doubtful. This is something you would need to look into but I think the way the display works would make it impossible to eliminate the blue light issue, Gupta said. The iOS 9.3 update was recently made available to developers, which means it will be a few weeks before the public will be able to download the update. In the meantime, you might want to think about setting yourself a digital bedtime. Most experts recommend you should avoid looking at screens of any type  yes that means smartphones, tablets and TVs  at least an hour before bedtime. 
 A Lineman in My Bed: Notes on Teeth Grinding By PAUL VanDeCARR, New York Times November 13, 2007 I grind my teeth at night. Have for years. Its my secret shame. But now I have the comfort of knowing that at least 8 to 10 percent of the adult population shares my malady. Its called sleep bruxism, and it refers to the grinding or clenching of teeth. Theres a waking version, too  an unconscious clenching of the teeth, most often owing to stress  but the origins are different and the effects are seldom anywhere near as bad as during sleep, when certain of the bodys protective mechanisms are turned off. Left untreated, it can cause damage to the teeth and surrounding tissue, headaches and jaw pain. Bruxism may be at least as old as the Bible, which describes hell as a state where there is gnashing of teeth. I might fairly be accused of hyperbole if I reversed the equation and declared that bruxism can turn sleep into a kind of hell. But you get the idea. Its a real nuisance. Its much like having a large football player standing on the tooth, says Dr. Noshir Mehta, chairman of general dentistry at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine and director of its Craniofacial Pain Center. During sleep bruxism, he explained, the upper and lower teeth may come into direct contact as much as 40 minutes per hour, and  for example, on the first molar  with a force of about 250 pounds. Hence the football player. Compare that with normal circumstances, when a persons teeth make contact for about 20 minutes a day, while chewing, and with only 20 to 40 pounds of pressure. Even if I wanted a football player in my bed, I certainly wouldnt want him standing on my teeth. I became aware of his presence the way that many bruxers do. My then-boyfriend told me I woke him up with a dreadful crunching noise that came from grinding; my dentist saw the wear patterns on my teeth and confirmed the diagnosis. Sleep bruxism is not a disease, but a common sleep disorder. It is more prevalent in children, who often outgrow it, and its origins may be different in adults. The exact causes are unknown, said Dr. Gilles Lavigne. If anyone would know, its Dr. Lavigne, a professor of dentistry and medicine at the University of Montreal, and president of the Canadian Sleep Society who has published extensively on the topic. In the 1960s, he explains, bruxism was thought to be the bodys response to malocclusion, or problems with how the upper and lower teeth fit together; but that theory was discredited for lack of clinical evidence. Stress was later thought to be the cause, but this failed to explain why not everyone with sleep bruxism was stressed and not everyone with stress ground their teeth. More recent research indicates some relationship of sleep bruxism to neurochemicals like dopamine, but there is still disagreement on how significant a role they play. Dr. Lavignes latest studies have identified a pattern of activation in the autonomic nervous system that correlates strongly with sleep bruxism. (He emphasizes that sleep bruxism is not an indicator of neurological disease.) Whatever underlying causes science may show in time, and they may be several, the more immediate contributing factors for sleep bruxism are better understood. The medical literature shows that stress, smoking, alcohol, caffeine and other factors may set off or worsen the condition. So whats a grinder to do? Right away, my dentist suggested fitting me with a mouth guard, a small plastic device that covers some or all of the teeth to protect them against damage, but does not stop the grinding or clenching itself. Unable to afford the $300 price tag at the time, I got an over-the-counter version at the drugstore for $20. The over-the-counter guards are usually better than nothing, said Dr. Charles McNeill, director of the Center for Orofacial Pain at the University of California, San Francisco. They protect the teeth, he says, but may also be more likely to induce a chewing response and increase bruxism; they can also cause irreversible damage to the bite, or arrangement of the teeth, and so should be used only temporarily. Guards made by a dentist last longer, fit better and are generally designed to distribute the force of grinding to reduce jaw pain. Feeling frustrated about my persistent bruxism, I was determined to find a way to stop altogether. Having started grinding during an especially hectic period in my life, I assumed that it was caused by stress. I tried relaxation techniques like yoga, exercise, biofeedback and hypnotherapy. Much as these may have helped my overall health, they didnt seem to kick the football player out of my bed. Besides, even well after the initial stressor had passed, I was still grinding. So I did what any reasonable person would do: I turned to drugs. The medical literature on bruxism showed that anti-anxiety medications like buspirone and clonazepam had worked on some patients; buspirone only made me jittery, but clonazepam brought my bruxism to, well, a grinding halt. Clonazepam would be a fantastic treatment, but its potentially habit-forming; it works too well, said Dr. Michael Gelb, a clinical professor at the New York University College of Dentistry. The better the pharmacological treatment works, the more fraught it is with difficulty. In two months, I became habituated to the drug and its effect began to diminish. I now use it only occasionally. So much for drugs. Throughout, I paid attention to which factors seemed to worsen my clenching and grinding, like alcohol and poor sleep habits, and cut back where necessary. On my dentists recommendation, I also tried out the NTI-tss device, a hard plastic splint that for some people substantially reduces the intensity of clenching and associated headaches. But I was evidently such an insistent bruxer that I outwitted the principle on which it is based. Finally, I came back to where I started: I got a mouth guard that covers all my teeth, this time custom-fitted by my dentist. Id abandoned hope of ending my bruxism until I met a woman recently who stopped 10 years grinding after a year of regular acupuncture treatments. I was encouraged enough to try acupuncture myself, and have noticed some improvement after a few months of weekly sessions. Acupuncture has not been clinically proved to cure or calm bruxism, but Im willing to hang my hopes on anecdotal evidence that suggests it helps. Though I didnt know it at the time, I had tried most of the approaches recommended for bruxism, albeit with less success than many people enjoy. Dr. Lavigne, of the Canadian Sleep Society, says people who wake up with headaches or jaw pain may clench or grind their teeth, and should consult their dentist, or doctors at a university-affiliated oral-facial pain center. There, patients may be directed to try some of the techniques I used, or others, and may be assessed for associated conditions like snoring. These approaches may reduce bruxism, but since there is no known cure, only the effects can be reliably treated. In the end, mouth guards are still the best defense. After all, if youre going to square off against a football player every night, you need padding. 
 New Recommendations to Achieve Healthy Sleep Medscape Medical News June 30, 2015 The American Thoracic Society (ATS) has released a policy statement with recommendations for clinicians and the general public on achieving good-quality sleep and getting enough sleep. "Sleep plays a vital role in human health, yet there is a lack of sufficient guidance on promoting good sleep health," said Sutapa Mukherjee, MBBS, PhD, chair of the ATS committee that produced the document. "In this statement, with an eye towards improving public health, we address the importance of good quality sleep with a focus on sleep health in adults and children; the effects of work schedules on sleep; the impact of drowsy driving; and the diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia." The statement is published in the June 15 issue of the American Thoracic Society's American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. Key recommendations include the following: Good-quality sleep is critical for good health and overall quality of life.Short sleep duration (6 hours or less per 24-hour period) is associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality.Long sleep duration (>9 to 10 hours per 24-hour period) may also be associated with adverse health outcomes.The optimal sleep duration in adults for good health at a population level is 7 to 9 hours, although individual variability exists.Because drowsy driving is an important cause of fatal and nonfatal motor vehicle crashes, all drivers (occupational and nonoccupational) should receive education about how to recognize the symptoms and consequences of drowsiness.Better education is needed for the general public and healthcare providers regarding the effect of working hours and shift work on sleep duration and quality and the association of sleepiness with workplace injuries.Sleep disorders are common, cause significant morbidity, and have substantial economic impact, but they are treatable. However, many individuals with sleep disorders remain undiagnosed and untreated.Age-based recommendations for sleep duration in children should be developed. These should enable the child to awaken spontaneously at the desired time through implementation of regular wake and sleep schedules.For adolescents, school start times should be delayed to align with physiologic circadian propensity of this age group.Healthcare providers should receive more education on sleep hygiene and encourage patients to maximize their sleep time.Public education programs should be developed to emphasize the importance of sleep for good health.Better education/awareness is needed of the importance of early identification of groups at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (in children and adults).Better education of physicians as to the effectiveness of cognitive-behavior therapy for insomnia rather than immediate implementation of hypnotics and sedatives, and structural changes to increase access to this therapy.

 CBT Effective for Chronic Insomnia Medscape Medical News June 12, 2015 Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can improve sleep in patients with chronic insomnia without recourse to drugs or experiencing adverse outcomes, the results of a meta-analysis reveal. The study, which included data from 20 studies of CBT in chronic insomnia, showed improvements on a range of sleep measures immediately following treatment, with some data indicating that there were further gains over time. "This supports recommendations that CBT [for insomnia] should be used as the initial intervention for chronic insomnia when possible," the investigators, led by James M. Trauer, MD, Melbourne Sleep Disorders Centre, East Melbourne, Australia, write. The study was published online June 9 in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Continued Improvement Dr Trauer explained that he and his colleagues undertook the research after looking at the profile of the patients in his sleep clinic. "We were interested by the fact that a lot of our patients with insomnia have quite a lot of medical treatments, and often vitamins and supplements, but haven't ever tried psychological treatments such as CBT for insomnia," he said. "A lot of the patients we see with insomnia describe having been on the Internet, tried sleep hygiene, tried various sleep tablets that have been prescribed by their GP, but they've never even heard of CBT for insomnia," Dr Trauer added. To examine the impact of the use of CBT for insomnia on diary measures of overnight sleep in adults with chronic insomnia, the researchers conducted a search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsyhINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and the PubMed Clinical Queries databases. Of 292 initial citations, 20 randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of face-to-face multimodal CBT vs comparator control groups in patients with chronic insomnia who were without comorbid conditions were selected, yielding a total of 1162 participants (mean age, 56 years). The various CBT approaches used in the studies included cognitive therapy, stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, and relaxation. Each study investigated CBT with at least three components. Results revealed that at posttreatment, sleep onset latency improved by a mean of 19.03 minutes with CBT, and wake after sleep onset improved by a mean of 26.00 minutes. In addition, total sleep time improved by 7.61 minutes, and there was a 9.91% improvement in sleep efficiency with CBT. Importantly, no adverse outcomes were reported with CBT. In performing the meta-analysis, the investigators found there was little consistency in follow-up, which made it difficult to determine the longer-term impact of CBT on insomnia. "Having said that, there were some data on that, and we think that a signal is beginning to emerge that, months down the track, you continue to maintain the gains that you made with the treatment, and those gains then even augment or get greater with time from the original treatment," Dr Trauer noted. "For example, for the total amount of time that patients are sleeping, it really didn't change very much immediately after the treatment, but months down the track, it looks as if it has improved significantly by half an hour or more after several months. That's consistent with how we understand the treatment to work," he added. In order for CBT to be more widely implemented, Dr Trauer believes there needs to be increased awareness and availability of CBT for insomnia. "For a lot of patients, even if they have heard of it, it's pretty difficult to access the treatment. One of the reasons for that, I suppose, is that the classic model is one-on-one treatment, and that's the studies that we included in our meta-analysis," he said. "It consists of one-on-one treatment for generally a period of an hour, with four to six sessions with a psychologist, and, given that insomnia is so widespread, if you adopt that model and try to roll it out to all of the population with insomnia, it's going to be difficult to provide those kinds of resources, because about 10% of the population has insomnia." Cultural Shift Needed In an accompanying editorial, Charles M. Morin, PhD, Université Laval, Quebec, Canada, notes that other studies have indicated that psychological therapies can produce sleep improvements in patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions, which is a common occurrence with insomnia. Speaking to Medscape Medical News, Dr Morin said that regardless of whether or not a patient with insomnia has comorbid conditions, the recommendation is the same. "We used to think that if insomnia was presenting, let's say, in the context of a depression, that we just needed to treat the depression and it would take care of the sleep problems. But oftentimes that was not the case," he said. "We could treat effectively the depression, but insomnia was the most common residual symptom, and oftentimes the persistence of that residual symptom would increase the relapse rate for depression." He continued: "Now, clearly the paradigm is different, and most experts would say that we need to treat both conditions...and the overall results will be much better in the end." Dr Morin believes that a cultural shift is required for CBT to become more widely used in the treatment of insomnia, alongside a change in the way in which CBT is reimbursed. "As long as we continue reimbursing medication treatment with a medical doctor but we don't for psychological treatment with a psychologist, I think that we are in trouble, because we are taking a very narrow view of how to take care of these kinds of problems," he said. "The medication is more like a Band-Aid, so in the short run, that's fine, but in the long run, we need to do CBT to address the underlying issues that perpetuate this sleep problem." Another barrier against the adoption of CBT is linked to education. Dr Morin stated: "We don't do a great deal of education about sleep and the importance of sleep." "If we only allow enough time in graduate school, in medical school to talk about sleep the way we do about nutrition, about exercise, then maybe people would pay more attention." Talking more generally about public health education programs, Dr Morin observed that "we don't hear a lot about sleep except maybe when a drug company brings a new medication on the market." "At least in Canada, we hear a lot about the importance about good nutrition, a good diet, about the importance of exercising to stay fit, but sleep occupies a third of our lives, and we really don't hear a lot about it, so we take it for granted until we start having sleep problems," he added. One way in which the case for CBT could be strengthened would be to link it to the poor clinical outcomes that are observed in people who suffer from chronic insomnia. Dr Morin pointed out that there are long-term epidemiologic studies documenting the impact of persistent insomnia, such as depression and hypertension. "Now what we need to do in terms of studies is to do long-term studies and not only aim at improving sleep but aim at reducing this negative health outcome," he said. He added that things are moving in the "right direction," because it is no longer taken for granted that the sleep problem will "go away" if, for example, a patient is treated for depression. "We just need to do a bit more different research, and probably need to do a bit more lobbying with the government and agencies and healthcare insurance companies," said Dr Morin. The authors' financial disclosures can be found in the original study. Ann Intern Med. Published online June 9, 2015. Abstract, Editorial 
 Taking Melatonin Correctly for Night Owls Marks Psychiatry Retrieved February 28, 2013 People who are charged up in the evenings can spend a lifetime battling their body’s natural drive to go to sleep later. Low dose melatonin at 0.3 mg – 1 mg taken 3-4 hours before bedtime can help you fall asleep earlier in the evenings. 
 I have had a hard time getting to sleep for years and have been taking 5 mg. of Ambien, and yet I can fall to sleep during the day with a book or the TV on. Recently I have not been able to get back to sleep when I awake in the middle of the night. Thing is I have started to begin dreaming on Ambien, and so just as I awake in the middle of the night, I am also in the middle of a dream. So I get up to use the restroom, but now when I go back to bed instead of getting another 5 mg. of Ambien, I decide to see if I can finish the dream. This puts me back to sleep since I am thinking of trying to continue my dream. If I was having dreams of being chased by a bad man like I used to dream, this wouldn't be easy. Last night my dream was wonderful. I was riding a bike out of town, and for some reason I got off my bike, leaving my purse and shoes with it. I started to walk back to my bike, but must have taken another road. I came upon the outskirts of our town, but a part of town I had never seen. It looks more like England (I had been watching James Herriot series.), and then a Chinese woman helped me get through the town. I was thinking how much I would love my husband to see this town and to eat lunch in it. Then she climbed some rocks and jumped in a pool in town. She wanted me to join, but I told her that I had to get home, and if I can't find my way I would ask to use a phone and have my husband come and get me. What a nice travel dream. I hope to continue to get to sleep this way and hope to someday figure out how to get off Ambien altogether. Reading a book doesn't help at night even though I don't read exciting books then. 
 FDA OKs New Kind of Sleep Drug Suvorexant (Belsomra) Medscape Medical News August 13, 2014 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today approved a first-in-class insomnia drug called suvorexant (Belsomra, Merck) after the manufacturer lowered the dosages to satisfy the agency's safety concerns. Last July, Merck announced that the FDA had declined to approve suvorexant until the starting dose for most patients was 10 mg. The agency also said that proposed upper-limit doses of 30 mg for elderly patients and 40 mg for nonelderly patients were unsafe. In a news release today, the FDA said it had approved suvorexant at 4 different strengths — 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg. The total dosage in 1 day should not exceed 20 mg. Merck noted in its own news release today that the recommended dose is 10 mg for most patients, just as the FDA insisted. Suvorexant, an orexin receptor antagonist, is the first drug of its kind to be approved for patients with insomnia. It alters the signaling of orexins, neurotransmitters responsible for regulating the sleep-wake cycle. The FDA determined that suvorexant was effective based on 3 clinical trials involving more than 500 participants. Those receiving suvorexant nodded off more quickly and spent less time awake for the rest of the night compared with participants given a placebo. Drowsiness was the most commonly reported adverse event for clinical trial participants taking suvorexant, which is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance. In next-day driving tests that the FDA asked Merck to perform, both male and female participants who took the 20-mg dose proved to be impaired drivers. The FDA advises physicians to caution patients at this dosage level against next-day driving or other activities requiring full alertness. Patients taking lower doses also should know about the risk for impaired driving the day after because sensitivity to the drug varies from person to person. "Using the lowest effective dose can reduce the risk of side effects, including next-morning drowsiness," said Ellis Unger, MD, director of the Office of Drug Evaluation I in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in the agency's news release. More information about today's decision is available on the FDA Web site. Not approved by Health Canada as of this date August 20, 2014 
 Insufficient Sleep Is a Public Health Epidemic CDC August 2014 Continued public health surveillance of sleep quality, duration, behaviors, and disorders is needed to monitor sleep difficulties and their health impact. Sleep is increasingly recognized as important to public health, with sleep insufficiency linked to motor vehicle crashes, industrial disasters, and medical and other occupational errors.1 Unintentionally falling asleep, nodding off while driving, and having difficulty performing daily tasks because of sleepiness all may contribute to these hazardous outcomes. Persons experiencing sleep insufficiency are also more likely to suffer from chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, depression, and obesity, as well as from cancer, increased mortality, and reduced quality of life and productivity.1 Sleep insufficiency may be caused by broad scale societal factors such as round-the-clock access to technology and work schedules, but sleep disorders such as insomnia or obstructive sleep apnea also play an important role.1 An estimated 50-70 million US adults have sleep or wakefulness disorder1. Notably, snoring is a major indicator of obstructive sleep apnea. dsSleep_270px.jpg In recognition of the importance of sleep to the nation's health, CDC surveillance of sleep-related behaviors has increased in recent years. Additionally, the Institute of Medicine encouraged collaboration between CDC and the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research to support development and expansion of adequate surveillance of the U.S. population's sleep patterns and associated outcomes. Two new reports on the prevalence of unhealthy sleep behaviors and self-reported sleep-related difficulties among U.S. adults provide further evidence that insufficient sleep is an important public health concern. Sleep-Related Unhealthy Behaviors The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey included a core question regarding perceived insufficient rest or sleep in 2008 (included since 1995 on the Health Related Quality of Life module) and an optional module of four questions on sleep behavior in 2009. Data from the 2009 BRFSS Sleep module were used to assess the prevalence of unhealthy/sleep behaviors by selected sociodemographic factors and geographic variations in 12 states. The analysis[PDF - 1.1MB] determined that, among 74,571 adult respondents in 12 states, 35.3% reported <7 hours of sleep during a typical 24-hour period, 48.0% reported snoring, 37.9% reported unintentionally falling asleep during the day at least once in the preceding month, and 4.7% reported nodding off or falling asleep while driving at least once in the preceding month. This is the first CDC surveillance report to include estimates of drowsy driving and unintentionally falling asleep during the day. The National Department of Transportation estimates drowsy driving to be responsible for 1,550 fatalities and 40,000 nonfatal injuries annually in the United States.2 dssleep_626px.jpg Self-reported Sleep-related Difficulties Among Adults The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) introduced the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire in 2005 for participants 16 years of age and older. This analysis [PDF - 1.1MB] was conducted using data from the last two survey cycles (2005–2006 and 2007–2008) to include 10,896 respondents aged ≥20 years. A short sleep duration was found to be more common among adults ages 20–39 years (37.0%) or 40–59 years (40.3%) than among adults aged ≥60 years (32.0%), and among non-Hispanic blacks (53.0%) compared to non-Hispanic whites (34.5%), Mexican-Americans (35.2%), or those of other race/ethnicity (41.7%). Adults who reported sleeping less than the recommended 7–9 hours per night were more likely to have difficulty performing many daily tasks. How Much Sleep Do We Need? And How Much Sleep Are We Getting? How much sleep we need varies between individuals but generally changes as we age. The National Institutes of Health suggests that school-age children need at least 10 hours of sleep daily, teens need 9-105 hours, and adults need 7-8 hours. According to data from the National Health Interview Survey, nearly 30% of adults reported an average of ≤6 hours of sleep per day in 2005-2007.3 In 2009, only 31% of high school students reported getting at least 8 hours of sleep on an average school night.4 Sleep Hygiene Tips The promotion of good sleep habits and regular sleep is known as sleep hygiene. The following sleep hygiene tips can be used to improve sleep. Go to bed at the same time each night and rise at the same time each morning.Avoid large meals before bedtime.Avoid caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime.Avoid nicotine.

 SELF-SHIATSU MIGHT HELP YOU SLEEP UHN University Health Network July 29, 2014 Leisa Bellmore, Shiatsu Therapist in the Artists Health Centre at Toronto Western Hospital demonstrates how to perform self-shiatsu on the hand to help with sleep. There are so many tips and myths surrounding what it takes to get a good night's sleep. Does a warm glass of milk help you drift off easier? Or will counting sheep actually help you fall asleep? While trouble sleeping can affect everyone at one point or another, for people with chronic pain sleep problems are a nightly issue. According to a 2003 global study of pain prevalence by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), "chronic pain is among the most disabling and costly afflictions in North America, Europe, and Australia." Relationship between chronic pain and sleep Leisa Bellmore, a shiatsu therapist in the Artists' Health Centre at Toronto Western Hospital, is hoping her pilot study on hand self-shiatsu is the beginning of helping people with chronic pain get a better night's sleep. "There's a bi-directional relationship between chronic pain and sleep," said Bellmore. "If you have chronic pain, sleep deficiency is more likely, and if you're not sleeping that can sustain chronic pain." Sense receptors in hands Published in the Journal of Integrative Medicine, the study focuses on participants administering shiatsu on their own hands for 10-15 minutes every night. "We focused on the hands for several reasons," said Bellmore. "The hands are easily accessible and we have lots of sense receptors in our hands, but most importantly people can do it themselves." People dealing with chronic pain often feel like they lack control over their own bodies and their overall health. Self-management from being able to administer their own therapy can lead to more positive feelings about their health. Traditional Chinese Medicine Shiatsu is based on the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Shiatsu practitioners apply thumb and finger pressure to different points on the soft tissues of the body in order to assess and treat a variety of conditions. For the study, occupational therapy and physical therapy students were taught the basic shiatsu techniques and in turn trained participants. For those who want to try hand self-shiatsu as a sleep intervention, Bellmore recommends repeating the patterns three times on the areas on the back of the hand and the palm, as well as on the top, bottom, and sides of the fingers to get the best results. Falling asleep faster Twelve participants completed the study and Bellmore says some reported falling asleep faster  sometimes even while administering treatment. Participants also said they woke up less during the night at the two week and eight week follow-ups. While the study focused on people with chronic pain, Bellmore says in theory anyone experiencing difficulty sleeping could trade counting sheep for hand self-shiatsu. "The benefits of this method are that it's a non-pharmaceutical intervention, there are no side effects, it's not invasive or painful to administer, it's cost-effective, and the hand is easily accessible to people who may have limited range of motion," said Bellmore. Avoid certain activities Whether you suffer with chronic pain or just occasionally have trouble sleeping, Bellmore recommends avoiding certain activities that can make it harder to fall asleep. "A lot of people watch TV in bed or use their computer late at night, which is terrible," said Bellmore. There has also been a lot written about how exercise can generate a better night's sleep, but she says that's not always the case. "Exercising raises your core body temperature, increases your heart rate, and prompts your system to release adrenaline," she explains. "So if you exercise late in the evening or just before bed it actually has the opposite effect." Smoking or eating a heavy meal late at night and even a stream of light coming through a door or window can all be added to the list of things that can disrupt sleep," said Bellmore. Bellmore worked with Cary Brown and Geoff Bostick of the University of Alberta on the pilot study. While the study had a small sample size, Bellmore is encouraged by the results. She says she hopes to expand the study to include more participants to get a better idea of the effects of hand self-shiatsu as a sleep intervention strategy.

Sense receptors in hands Published in the Journal of Integrative Medicine, the study focuses on participants administering shiatsu on their own hands for 10-15 minutes every night. "We focused on the hands for several reasons," said Bellmore. "The hands are easily accessible and we have lots of sense receptors in our hands, but most importantly people can do it themselves." People dealing with chronic pain often feel like they lack control over their own bodies and their overall health. Self-management from being able to administer their own therapy can lead to more positive feelings about their health. Traditional Chinese Medicine Shiatsu is based on the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Shiatsu practitioners apply thumb and finger pressure to different points on the soft tissues of the body in order to assess and treat a variety of conditions. For the study, occupational therapy and physical therapy students were taught the basic shiatsu techniques and in turn trained participants. For those who want to try hand self-shiatsu as a sleep intervention, Bellmore recommends repeating the patterns three times on the areas on the back of the hand and the palm, as well as on the top, bottom, and sides of the fingers to get the best results. Falling asleep faster Twelve participants completed the study and Bellmore says some reported falling asleep faster  sometimes even while administering treatment. Participants also said they woke up less during the night at the two week and eight week follow-ups. While the study focused on people with chronic pain, Bellmore says in theory anyone experiencing difficulty sleeping could trade counting sheep for hand self-shiatsu. "The benefits of this method are that it's a non-pharmaceutical intervention, there are no side effects, it's not invasive or painful to administer, it's cost-effective, and the hand is easily accessible to people who may have limited range of motion," said Bellmore. Avoid certain activities Whether you suffer with chronic pain or just occasionally have trouble sleeping, Bellmore recommends avoiding certain activities that can make it harder to fall asleep. "A lot of people watch TV in bed or use their computer late at night, which is terrible," said Bellmore. There has also been a lot written about how exercise can generate a better night's sleep, but she says that's not always the case. "Exercising raises your core body temperature, increases your heart rate, and prompts your system to release adrenaline," she explains. "So if you exercise late in the evening or just before bed it actually has the opposite effect." Smoking or eating a heavy meal late at night and even a stream of light coming through a door or window can all be added to the list of things that can disrupt sleep," said Bellmore. Bellmore worked with Cary Brown and Geoff Bostick of the University of Alberta on the pilot study. While the study had a small sample size, Bellmore is encouraged by the results. She says she hopes to expand the study to include more participants to get a better idea of the effects of hand self-shiatsu as a sleep intervention strategy.

 Twelve Simple Tips to Improve Your Sleep Harvard Division of Sleep Medicine July 2014 Falling asleep may seem like an impossible dream when youre awake at 3 a.m., but good sleep is more under your control than you might think. Following healthy sleep habits can make the difference between restlessness and restful slumber. Researchers have identified a variety of practices and habitsknown as sleep hygiene"that can help anyone maximize the hours they spend sleeping, even those whose sleep is affected by insomnia, jet lag, or shift work. Sleep hygiene may sound unimaginative, but it just may be the best way to get the sleep you need in this 24/7 age. Here are some simple tips for making the sleep of your dreams a nightly reality: #1 Avoid Caffeine, Alcohol, Nicotine, and Other Chemicals that Interfere with Sleep Caffeinated products decrease a persons quality of sleep. As any coffee lover knows, caffeine is a stimulant that can keep you awake. So avoid caffeine (found in coffee, tea, chocolate, cola, and some pain relievers) for four to six hours before bedtime. Similarly, smokers should refrain from using tobacco products too close to bedtime. Although alcohol may help bring on sleep, after a few hours it acts as a stimulant, increasing the number of awakenings and generally decreasing the quality of sleep later in the night. It is therefore best to limit alcohol consumption to one to two drinks per day, or less, and to avoid drinking within three hours of bedtime. #2 Turn Your Bedroom into a Sleep-Inducing Environment A quiet, dark, and cool environment can help promote sound slumber. Why do you think bats congregate in caves for their daytime sleep? To achieve such an environment, lower the volume of outside noise with earplugs or a "white noise" appliance. Use heavy curtains, blackout shades, or an eye mask to block light, a powerful cue that tells the brain that it's time to wake up. Keep the temperature comfortably coolbetween 60 and 75°Fand the room well ventilated. And make sure your bedroom is equipped with a comfortable mattress and pillows. (Remember that most mattresses wear out after ten years.) Also, if a pet regularly wakes you during the night, you may want to consider keeping it out of your bedroom. It may help to limit your bedroom activities to sleep and sex only. Keeping computers, TVs, and work materials out of the room will strengthen the mental association between your bedroom and sleep. #3 Establish a Soothing Pre-Sleep Routine Light reading before bed is a good way to prepare yourself for sleep. Ease the transition from wake time to sleep time with a period of relaxing activities an hour or so before bed. Take a bath (the rise, then fall in body temperature promotes drowsiness), read a book, watch television, or practice relaxation exercises. Avoid stressful, stimulating activitiesdoing work, discussing emotional issues. Physically and psychologically stressful activities can cause the body to secrete the stress hormone cortisol, which is associated with increasing alertness. If you tend to take your problems to bed, try writing them downand then putting them aside. #4 Go to Sleep When Youre Truly Tired Struggling to fall sleep just leads to frustration. If youre not asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed, go to another room, and do something relaxing, like reading or listening to music until you are tired enough to sleep. #5 Dont Be a Nighttime Clock-Watcher Staring at a clock in your bedroom, either when you are trying to fall asleep or when you wake in the middle of the night, can actually increase stress, making it harder to fall asleep. Turn your clocks face away from you. And if you wake up in the middle of the night and cant get back to sleep in about 20 minutes, get up and engage in a quiet, restful activity such as reading or listening to music. And keep the lights dim; bright light can stimulate your internal clock. When your eyelids are drooping and you are ready to sleep, return to bed. #6 Use Light to Your Advantage Natural light keeps your internal clock on a healthy sleep-wake cycle. So let in the light first thing in the morning and get out of the office for a sun break during the day. #7 Keep Your Internal Clock Set with a Consistent Sleep Schedule Having a regular sleep schedule helps to ensure better quality and consistent sleep. Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day sets the bodys "internal clock" to expect sleep at a certain time night after night. Try to stick as closely as possible to your routine on weekends to avoid a Monday morning sleep hangover. Waking up at the same time each day is the very best way to set your clock, and even if you did not sleep well the night before, the extra sleep drive will help you consolidate sleep the following night. Learn more about the importance of synchronizing the clock in The Drive to Sleep and Our Internal Clock. #8 Nap EarlyOr Not at All Many people make naps a regular part of their day. However, for those who find falling asleep or staying asleep through the night problematic, afternoon napping may be one of the culprits. This is because late-day naps decrease sleep drive. If you must nap, its better to keep it short and before 5 p.m. #9 Lighten Up on Evening Meals Eating a pepperoni pizza at 10 p.m. may be a recipe for insomnia. Finish dinner several hours before bedtime and avoid foods that cause indigestion. If you get hungry at night, snack on foods that (in your experience) won't disturb your sleep, perhaps dairy foods and carbohydrates. #10 Balance Fluid Intake Drink enough fluid at night to keep from waking up thirstybut not so much and so close to bedtime that you will be awakened by the need for a trip to the bathroom. #11 Exercise Early Exercise helps promote restful sleep if it is done several hours before you go to bed. Exercise can help you fall asleep faster and sleep more soundlyas long as it's done at the right time. Exercise stimulates the body to secrete the stress hormone cortisol, which helps activate the alerting mechanism in the brain. This is fine, unless you're trying to fall asleep. Try to finish exercising at least three hours before bed or work out earlier in the day. #12 Follow Through Some of these tips will be easier to include in your daily and nightly routine than others. However, if you stick with them, your chances of achieving restful sleep will improve. That said, not all sleep problems are so easily treated and could signify the presence of a sleep disorder such as apnea, restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy, or another clinical sleep problem. If your sleep difficulties dont improve through good sleep hygiene, you may want to consult your physician or a sleep specialist. Learn more at When to Seek Treatment. 
 I'm having really bad night terrors and night sweats at the moment! It's a vicious circle, I have these awful nightmares and wake up screaming and crying, but I feel so warn out I need more sleep, the more I sleep, the more its happening! The thing that worries me the most is that I can remember everything that I dream about and it takes me ages to stop thinking about them, I don't know why, I just feel that if I could sort them out in my head, maybe the night terrors would go away for a while!! It's not working right now though!! I also am a bit freaked out because i am regularly suffering from 'de ja vue' (forgive me if its spelled wrong, i hope you know what i mean though?) Its a strange and scary thing to be continuously thinking that things have already happened and feeling like you are losing the plot!! 
 Scientists identify the switch that says it's time to sleep University of Oxford News February 19, 2014 The switch in the brain that sends us off to sleep has been identified by researchers at Oxford Universitys Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour in a study in fruit flies. The switch works by regulating the activity of a handful of sleep-promoting nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain. The neurons fire when were tired and need sleep, and dampen down when were fully rested. When youre tired, these neurons in the brain shout loud and they send you to sleep, says Professor Gero Miesenböck of Oxford University, in whose laboratory the new research was performed. Although the research was carried out in fruit flies, or Drosophila, the scientists say the sleep mechanism is likely to be relevant to humans. Dr Jeffrey Donlea, one of the lead authors of the study, explains: There is a similar group of neurons in a region of the human brain. These neurons are also electrically active during sleep and, like the flies cells, are the targets of general anaesthetics that put us to sleep. Its therefore likely that a molecular mechanism similar to the one we have discovered in flies also operates in humans. The researchers say that pinpointing the sleep switch might help us identify new targets for novel drugs  potentially to improve treatments for sleep disorders. But there is much still to find out, and further research could give insight into the big unanswered question of why we need to sleep at all, they say. The big question now is to figure out what internal signal the sleep switch responds to, says Dr Diogo Pimentel of Oxford University, the other lead author of the study. What do these sleep-promoting cells monitor while we are awake? If we knew what happens in the brain during waking that requires sleep to reset, we might get closer to solving the mystery of why all animals need to sleep. The findings are reported in the journal Neuron. The work of the Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour is funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Gatsby Charitable Foundation. This study was also supported by the UK Medical Research Council, the US National Institutes of Health, and the Human Frontier Science Program. The body uses two mechanisms to regulate sleep. One is the body clock, which attunes humans and animals to the 24 hour cycle of day and night. The other mechanism is the sleep homeostat: a device in the brain that keeps track of your waking hours and puts you to sleep when you need to reset. This mechanism represents an internal nodding off point that is separate from external factors. When it is turned off or out of use, sleep deficits build up. What makes us go to sleep at night is probably a combination of the two mechanisms, says Professor Miesenböck. The body clock says its the right time, and the sleep switch has built up pressure during a long waking day. The work in fruit flies allowed the critical part of the sleep switch to be discovered. We discovered mutant flies that couldnt catch up on their lost sleep after they had been kept awake all night, says Dr Jeffrey Donlea. Flies stop moving when they go to sleep and require more disturbance to get them up. Sleep-deprived flies are prone to nodding off and are cognitively impaired  they have severe learning and memory deficits, much as sleep loss in humans leads to problems. Professor Miesenböck says: The sleep homeostat is similar to the thermostat in your home. A thermostat measures temperature and switches on the heating if its too cold. The sleep homeostat measures how long a fly has been awake and switches on a small group of specialized cells in the brain if necessary. Its the electrical output of these nerve cells that puts the fly to sleep. In the mutant flies, the researchers were able to show a key molecular component of the electrical activity switch is broken and the sleep-inducing neurons are always off, causing insomnia. 
 Goodnight. Sleep Clean. By MARIA KONNIKOVAJAN, New York Times January 12, 2014 SLEEP seems like a perfectly fine waste of time. Why would our bodies evolve to spend close to one-third of our lives completely out of it, when we could instead be doing something useful or exciting? Something that would, as an added bonus, be less likely to get us killed back when we were sleeping on the savanna? Sleep is such a dangerous thing to do, when youre out in the wild, Maiken Nedergaard, a Danish biologist who has been leading research into sleep function at the University of Rochesters medical school, told me. It has to have a basic evolutional function. Otherwise it would have been eliminated. Weve known for some time that sleep is essential for forming and consolidating memories and that it plays a central role in the formation of new neuronal connections and the pruning of old ones. But that hardly seems enough to risk death-by-leopard-in-the-night. If sleep was just to remember what you did yesterday, that wouldnt be important enough, Dr. Nedergaard explains. In a series of new studies, published this fall in the journal Science, the Nedergaard lab may at last be shedding light on just what it is that would be important enough. Sleep, it turns out, may play a crucial role in our brains physiological maintenance. As your body sleeps, your brain is quite actively playing the part of mental janitor: Its clearing out all of the junk that has accumulated as a result of your daily thinking. Recall what happens to your body during exercise. You start off full of energy, but soon enough your breathing turns uneven, your muscles tire, and your stamina runs its course. Whats happening internally is that your body isnt able to deliver oxygen quickly enough to each muscle that needs it and instead creates needed energy anaerobically. And while that process allows you to keep on going, a side effect is the accumulation of toxic byproducts in your muscle cells. Those byproducts are cleared out by the bodys lymphatic system, allowing you to resume normal function without any permanent damage. The lymphatic system serves as the bodys custodian: Whenever waste is formed, it sweeps it clean. The brain, however, is outside its reach  despite the fact that your brain uses up about 20 percent of your bodys energy. How, then, does its waste  like beta-amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimers disease  get cleared? What happens to all the wrappers and leftovers that litter the room after any mental workout? Think about a fish tank, says Dr. Nedergaard. If you have a tank and no filter, the fish will eventually die. So, how do the brain cells get rid of their waste? Where is their filter? UNTIL a few years ago, the prevailing model was based on recycling: The brain got rid of its own waste, not only beta-amyloid but other metabolites, by breaking it down and recycling it at an individual cell level. When that process eventually failed, the buildup would result in age-related cognitive decline and diseases like Alzheimers. That didnt make sense to Dr. Nedergaard, who says that the brain is too busy to recycle all of its energy. Instead, she proposed a brain equivalent of the lymphatic system, a network of channels that cleared out toxins with watery cerebrospinal fluid. She called it the glymphatic system, a nod to its dependence on glial cells (the supportive cells in the brain that work largely to maintain homeostasis and protect neurons) and its function as a sort of parallel lymphatic system. She was hardly the first to think in those terms. It had been proposed about one hundred years ago, but they didnt have the tools to study it properly, she says. Now, however, with advanced microscopes and dyeing techniques, her team discovered that the brains interstitial space  the fluid-filled area between tissue cells that takes up about 20 percent of the brains total volume  was mainly dedicated to physically removing the cells daily waste. When members of Dr. Nedergaards team injected small fluorescent tracers into the cerebrospinal fluid of anesthetized mice, they found that the tracers quickly entered the brain  and, eventually, exited it  via specific, predictable routes. The next step was to see how and when, exactly, the glymphatic system did its work. We thought this cleaning process would require tremendous energy, Dr. Nedergaard says. And so we asked, maybe this is something we do when were sleeping, when the brain is really not processing information. In a series of new studies on mice, her team discovered exactly that: When the mouse brain is sleeping or under anesthesia, its busy cleaning out the waste that accumulated while it was awake. In a mouse brain, the interstitial space takes up less room than it does in ours, approximately 14 percent of the total volume. Dr. Nedergaard found that when the mice slept, it swelled to over 20 percent. As a result, the cerebrospinal fluid could not only flow more freely but it could also reach further into the brain. In an awake brain, it would flow only along the brains surface. Indeed, the awake flow was a mere 5 percent of the sleep flow. In a sleeping brain, waste was being cleared two times faster. We saw almost no inflow of cerebrospinal fluid into the brain when the mice were awake, but then when we anesthetized them, it started flowing. Its such a big difference I kept being afraid something was wrong, says Dr. Nedergaard. Similar work in humans is still in the future. Dr. Nedergaard is currently awaiting board approval to begin the equivalent study in adult brains in collaboration with the anesthesiologist Helene Benveniste at Stony Brook University. So far the glymphatic system has been identified as the neural housekeeper in baboons, dogs and goats. If anything, Dr. Nedergaard says, its more needed in a bigger brain. MODERN society is increasingly ill equipped to provide our brains with the requisite cleaning time. The figures are stark. Some 80 percent of working adults suffer to some extent from sleep deprivation. According to the National Sleep Foundation, adults should sleep seven to nine hours. On average, were getting one to two hours less sleep a night than we did 50 to 100 years ago and 38 minutes less on weeknights than we did as little as 10 years ago. Between 50 and 70 million people in the United States suffer from some form of chronic sleep disorder. When our sleep is disturbed, whatever the cause, our cleaning system breaks down. At the University of Pennsylvanias Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology, Sigrid Veasey has been focusing on precisely how restless nights disturb the brains normal metabolism. What happens to our cognitive function when the trash piles up? At the extreme end, the result could be the acceleration of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimers and Parkinsons. While we dont know whether sleep loss causes the disease, or the disease itself leads to sleep loss  what Dr. Veasey calls a classic chicken-and-egg problem  we do know that the two are closely connected. Along with the sleep disturbances that characterize neurodegenerative diseases, there is a buildup of the types of proteins that the glymphatic system normally clears out during regular sleep, like beta-amyloids and tau, both associated with Alzheimers and other types of dementia. To me, says Dr. Veasey, thats the most compelling part of the Nedergaard research. That the clearance for these is dramatically reduced from prolonged wakefulness. If we dont sleep well, we may be allowing the very things that cause neural degeneration to pile up unchecked. Even at the relatively more benign end  the all-nighter or the extra-stressful week when you caught only a few hours a night  sleep deprivation, as everyone who has experienced it knows, impedes our ability to concentrate, to pay attention to our environment and to analyze information creatively. When were sleep-deprived, we cant integrate or put together facts, as Dr. Veasey puts it. But there is a difference between the kind of fleeting sleep loss we sometimes experience and the chronic deprivation that comes from shift work, insomnia and the like. In one set of studies, soon to be published in The Journal of Neuroscience, the Veasey lab found that while our brains can recover quite readily from short-term sleep loss, chronic prolonged wakefulness and sleep disruption stresses the brains metabolism. The result is the degeneration of key neurons involved in alertness and proper cortical function and a buildup of proteins associated with aging and neural degeneration. Its like the difference between a snowstorms disrupting a single day of trash pickup and a prolonged strike. No longer quite as easy to fix, and even when the strike is over, theres likely to be some stray debris floating around for quite some time yet. Recovery from sleep loss is slower than wed thought, Dr. Veasey notes. We used to think that after a bit of recovery sleep, you should be fine. But this work shows youre not. If you put her own research together with the findings from the Nedergaard lab, Dr. Veasey says, it very clearly shows that theres impaired clearance in the awake brain. Were really starting to realize that when we skip sleep, we may be doing irreparable damage to the brain, prematurely aging it or setting it up for heightened vulnerability to other insults. In a society that is not only chronically sleep-deprived but also rapidly aging, thats bad news. Its unlikely that poor sleep as a child would actually cause Alzheimers or Parkinsons, says Dr. Veasey, but its more likely that you may shift one of those diseases by a decade or so. That has profound health and economic implications. Its a pernicious cycle. We work longer hours, become more stressed, sleep less, impair our brains ability to clean up after all that hard work, and become even less able to sleep soundly. And if we reach for a sleeping pill to help us along? While work on the effects of sleeping aids on the glymphatic system remains to be done, the sleep researchers I spoke with agree that theres no evidence that aided sleep is as effective as natural sleep. There is, however, reason to hope. If the main function of sleep is to take out our neural trash, that insight could eventually enable a new understanding of both neurodegenerative diseases and regular, age-related cognitive decline. By developing a diagnostic test to measure how well the glymphatic system functions, we could move one step closer to predicting someones risk of developing conditions like Alzheimers or other forms of dementia: The faster the fluids clear the decks, the more effectively the brains metabolism is functioning. Such a test could also be used in the emergency room after traumatic brain injury, Dr. Nedergaard says, to see who is at risk of developing decline in cognitive function. We can also focus on developing earlier, more effective interventions to prevent cognitive decline. One approach would be to enable individuals who suffer from sleep loss to sleep more soundly  but how? Dr. Nedergaards mice were able to clear their brains waste almost as effectively under anesthesia as under normal sleeping conditions. Thats really fascinating, says Dr. Veasey. Though current sleeping aids may not quite do the trick, and anesthetics are too dangerous for daily use, the results suggest that there may be better ways of improving sleep pharmacologically. Now that we have a better understanding of why sleep is so important, a new generation of drug makers can work to create the best possible environment for the trash pickup to occur in the first place  to make certain that our brains sleeping metabolism is as efficient as it can possibly be. A second approach would take the opposite tack, by seeking to mimic the cleanup-promoting actions of sleep in the awake brain, which could make a full night of sound sleep less necessary. To date, the brains metabolic process hasnt been targeted as such by the pharmaceutical industry. There simply wasnt enough evidence of its importance. In response to the evolving data, however, future drug interventions could focus directly on the glymphatic system, to promote the enhanced cleaning power of the sleeping brain in a brain that is fully awake. One day, scientists might be able to successfully mimic the expansion of the interstitial space that does the mental janitorial work so that we can achieve maximally efficient round-the-clock brain trash pickup. If that day comes, they would be on their way to discovering that all-time miracle drug: one that, in Dr. Veaseys joking words, could mean we never have to sleep at all. Maria Konnikova is the author of Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes. 
 Sleep duration predicts chronic depression and anxiety By Lucy Piper, MedwireNews 06 January 2014 J Clin Psychiatry 2013; Advance online publication Short and long sleep duration, but not insomnia, predict a chronic course of depressive and anxiety disorders independent of symptom severity, research indicates. Patients with persistent depression or anxiety were more likely to have insomnia than those without persistent disorders. However, insomnia was not independently associated with persistence after accounting for symptom severity. Our results also show that it is important to differentiate between insomnia and sleep duration, since there was no interaction effect between insomnia and sleep duration, the researchers note in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. They studied 1069 individuals aged an average of 42.7 years with DSM-IV-diagnosed depression or anxiety, 59% of whom had insomnia, diagnosed as a Womens Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale score of 9 or above. At 2-year follow-up, persistent depressive and/or anxiety disorder, according to the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, was seen in 61.1% of patients. Patients who reported sleeping an average of 10 hours or more per night were a significant 2.52 times more likely to have persistent (6-month diagnosis) depression and/or anxiety over 2 years of follow-up than patients who reported sleeping for a normal 7 to 9 hours per night. This was after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, chronic medical disorders, psychotropic medication, and symptom severity. Those who reported short sleep durations of 6 hours or less per night were a significant 1.64 times more likely to have persistent depression and/or anxiety, but, as with insomnia, significance was lost after adjustment for symptom severity. Both long and short sleep duration were also independently associated with a chronic course (no remission, and at least mild symptoms for 2 years of follow-up) of depression and/or anxiety, increasing the risk a significant 2.91-fold and 1.50-fold, respectively. When the researchers looked at the effects of sleep duration on the course of depression and anxiety separately, they found that both long and short sleep duration predicted a chronic course of anxiety symptoms, with significant odds ratios of 7.73 and 1.62, respectively. The same was true for chronic depressive symptoms, with corresponding odds of 4.34 and 2.03. Long and short sleep duration also predicted persistent depressive disorder, at significant odds ratios of 2.52 and 1.49, respectively, but neither predicted persistent anxiety disorder. Our study adds significant information on the impact of sleep disturbances on the course of psychopathology, say lead researcher Josine van Mill (EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research, Amsterdam, the Netherlands)and colleagues. In clinical practice, routinely asking for sleep duration might identify subjects at risk for a chronic course. Free abstract 
 Sleep Therapy Seen as an Aid for Depression By BENEDICT CAREY, New York Times November 18, 2013 Curing insomnia in people with depression could double their chance of a full recovery, scientists are reporting. The findings, based on an insomnia treatment that uses talk therapy rather than drugs, are the first to emerge from a series of closely watched studies of sleep and depression to be released in the coming year. The new report affirms the results of a smaller pilot study, giving scientists confidence that the effects of the insomnia treatment are real. If the figures continue to hold up, the advance will be the most significant in the treatment of depression since the introduction of Prozac in 1987. Depression is the most common mental disorder, affecting some 18 million Americans in any given year, according to government figures, and more than half of them also have insomnia. Experts familiar with the new report said that the results were plausible and that if supported by other studies, they should lead to major changes in treatment. It would be an absolute boon to the field, said Dr. Nada L. Stotland, professor of psychiatry at Rush Medical College in Chicago, who was not connected with the latest research. It makes good common sense clinically, she continued. If you have a depression, youre often awake all night, its extremely lonely, its dark, youre aware every moment that the world around you is sleeping, every concern you have is magnified. The study is the first of four on sleep and depression nearing completion, all financed by the National Institute of Mental Health. They are evaluating a type of talk therapy for insomnia that is cheap, relatively brief and usually effective, but not currently a part of standard treatment. The new report, from a team at Ryerson University in Toronto, found that 87 percent of patients who resolved their insomnia in four biweekly talk therapy sessions also saw their depression symptoms dissolve after eight weeks of treatment, either with an antidepressant drug or a placebo pill  almost twice the rate of those who could not shake their insomnia. Those numbers are in line with a previous pilot study of insomnia treatment at Stanford. In an interview, the reports lead author, Colleen E. Carney, said, The way this story is unfolding, I think we need to start augmenting standard depression treatment with therapy focused on insomnia. Dr. Carney acknowledged that the study was small  just 66 patients  and said a clearer picture should emerge as the other teams of scientists released their results. Those studies are being done at Stanford, Duke and the University of Pittsburgh and include about 70 subjects each. Dr. Carney will present her data on Saturday at a convention of the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies, in Nashville. Doctors have known for years that sleep problems are intertwined with mood disorders. But only recently have they begun to investigate the effects of treating both at the same time. Antidepressant drugs like Prozac help many people, as does talk therapy, but in rigorous studies the treatments, administered individually, only slightly outperform placebo pills. Used together the treatments produce a cure rate  full recovery  for about 40 percent of patients. Adding insomnia therapy, however, to an antidepressant would sharply lift the cure rate, Dr. Carneys data suggests, as do the findings from the Stanford pilot study, which included 30 people. Doctors have long considered poor sleep to be a symptom of depression that would clear up with treatments, said Rachel Manber, a professor in the psychiatry and behavioral sciences department at Stanford, whose 2008 pilot trial of insomnia therapy provided the rationale for larger studies. But we now know thats not the case, she said. The relationship is bidirectional  that insomnia can precede the depression. Full-blown insomnia is more serious than the sleep problems most people occasionally have. To qualify for a diagnosis, people must have endured at least a month of chronic sleep loss that has caused problems at work, at home or in important relationships. Several studies now suggest that developing insomnia doubles a persons risk of later becoming depressed  the sleep problem preceding the mood disorder, rather than the other way around. The therapy that Dr. Manber, Dr. Carney and the other researchers are using is called cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia, or CBT-I for short. The therapist teaches people to establish a regular wake-up time and stick to it; get out of bed during waking periods; avoid eating, reading, watching TV or similar activities in bed; and eliminate daytime napping. The aim is to reserve time in bed for only sleeping and  at least as important  to curb this idea that sleeping requires effort, that its something you have to fix, Dr. Carney said. Thats when people get in trouble, when they begin to think they have to do something to get to sleep. This kind of therapy is distinct from what is commonly known as sleep hygiene: exercising regularly, but not too close to bedtime, and avoiding coffee and too much alcohol in the evening. These healthful habits do not amount to an effective treatment for insomnia. In her 2008 pilot study testing CBT-I in people with depression, Dr. Manber of Stanford used sleep hygiene as part of her control treatment. She found that 60 percent of patients who received seven sessions of the talk therapy and an antidepressant fully recovered from their depression, compared with 33 percent who got the same drug and the sleep hygiene therapy. In the four larger trials expected to be published in 2014, researchers had participants keep sleep journals to track the effect of the CBT-I therapy, writing down what time they went to bed every night, what time they tried to fall asleep, how long it took, how many awakenings they had and what time they woke up. When the diaries show consistent, seldom-interrupted, good-quality slumber, the therapist conducts an interview to determine if there are any lingering issues. If there are none, the person has recovered. The therapy results in sharp reductions in nighttime wakefulness for most people who follow through. In interviews, several researchers noted that the National Institute of Mental Health had sharply curtailed funding for work in sleep treatment. Aleksandra Vicentic, the acting chief of the agencys behavioral and integrative neuroscience research branch, said that in 2009 the funding strategy changed for sleep projects. In an effort to illuminate the biology of sleeps impact on behavior, the agency is now focusing on how sleep affects the functioning of neural circuits. But Dr. Vicentic added that the agency continued to fund clinical work like the depression trials. Dr. Andrew Krystal, who is running the CBT-I study at Duke, called sleep this huge, still unexplored frontier of psychiatry. The body has complex circadian cycles, and mostly in psychiatry weve ignored them, he said. Our treatments are driven by convenience. We treat during the day and make little effort to find out whats happening at night. 
 Caffeine may harm sleep 6 hours before bedtime CBC News November 14, 2013 Taking caffeine even six hours before bedtime could reduce sleep by more than one hour, an effect that's underestimated by the general public and doctors, researchers say. While sleep experts recommend refraining from drinking coffee or consuming other food and drinks with caffeine close to bedtime, few studies have checked into the effects of taking caffeine in the late afternoon and early evening. A small study published in Friday's Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine tested the effects on sleep of 400 milligrams of caffeine  about 2-3 cups of coffee  taken at bedtime, three and six hours before lights out. "Even at six hours, caffeine reduced sleep by more than one hour," Christopher Drake of the Henry Ford Sleep Disorders and Research Center in Detroit and his co-authors concluded. Losing an hour of sleep over multiple nights may harm daytime function, the researchers said. "The present results suggest the common practice of afternoon consumption of caffeine should at a minimum be restricted to before 5.00 PM, particularly with regard to the moderate-large doses of caffeine commonly found in increasingly popular premium coffees and energy drinks." Commercially available 16-ounce servings of specialty coffee were found to contain up to 500 milligrams of caffeine in one study. Health Canada recommends no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day  about three 8 ounce cups (237 ml) of brewed coffee  with a lower limit for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant. Drake's team tested 12 healthy people with an average age of 39 who were asked to continue their normal sleep schedules of going to bed between 21:00 and 01:00 and waking between 0600 and 0900. The subjects were given three pills a day for four days and told to take one pill at six, three and zero hours before bedtime. There were 400 milligrams of caffeine in one of the pills and the other two were placebos. On one of the days, all three pills were placebos. There was also a washout night before each pill day. The subjects filled in sleep diaries and had their sleep disturbances measured objectively using an in-home sleep monitor that records EEG signals. The participants noticed their sleep was disturbed when they took caffeine pills at bedtime or three hours earlier but not six hours before. The researchers called the lack of perceived sleep disturbance an important finding that points to the need for more education. "The risks of caffeine use in terms of sleep disturbance are underestimated by both the general population and physicians," the study's authors said. Limitations of the study include the small number of subjects and lack of measuring caffeine levels in the blood. The study was funded by Zeo Inc. and several authors have financial interests or served as consultants to drug and sleep device manufacturers. 
 “Hidden Caves” in the Brain Open Up During Sleep to Wash Away Toxins by Jeremy Dean, PsyBlog November 11, 2013 “Hidden caves” that open up in the brain may help explain sleep’s amazing restorative powers. A new study published in the prestigious journal, Science, has found that the brain may wash away toxins built up over the day during sleep. The research discovered “hidden caves” inside the brain, which open up during sleep, allowing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to flush out potential neurotoxins, like β-amyloid, which has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease. To reach their discovery, researchers injected mice’s brains with a dye and monitored the flow while they were awake, asleep and anaesthetised (Xie et al., 2013). One of the study’s authors, Dr Maiken Nedergaard, explained the results: “We were surprised by how little flow there was into the brain when the mice were awake. It suggested that the space between brain cells changed greatly between conscious and unconscious states.” For a long time the real physiological purpose of sleep has remained a mystery. We know that lack of sleep causes all kinds of psychological problems like poor learning, decision-making and so on. We also know that animals that are chronically deprived of sleep will eventually die: flies or rodents in days to weeks, humans within months or years. Everyone who has ever enjoyed a blissfully good night’s sleep knows just how restorative it can be, but the actual physiological process wasn’t clear. This study, though, suggests that the flushing out of toxins by the CSF may be central to sleep’s wondrous powers. The interstitial spaces in the mouse’s brain took up only 14% of the brain’s volume while it was awake. Yet, while it slept, this increased by almost two-thirds to take up fully 23% of the brain’s total volume. The difference might seem slight, but the actual physiological effects are profound. During the day, the CSF mostly covers the surface of the brain. During sleep, though, the CSF is able to move deep inside. The effect is that potential neurotoxins, like β-amyloid, are cleared twice as fast during sleep as during waking. The results of this study–if they hold in humans–may help to explain why many neurological diseases, like strokes and dementia, are associated with problems sleeping. It could be that lack of sleep, and restriction of the brain’s cleaning system, may cause toxic metabolites to building up, leading to long-term damage. Jeremy Dean is a psychologist and the author of PsyBlog. His latest book is Making Habits, Breaking Habits: How to Make Changes That Stick. 
 Daylight Saving Time fall back doesnt equal sleep gain by Anthony Komaroff, M.D., Harvard Health November 2, 2013 Daylight Saving Time officially ends at 2:00 am this Sunday. In theory, falling back means an extra hour of sleep this weekend. Winston Churchill once described Daylight Saving Time like this: An extra yawn one morning in the springtime, an extra snooze one night in the autumn We borrow an hour one night in April; we pay it back with golden interest five months later. Thats an overly optimistic view. In reality, many people dont, or cant, take advantage of this weekends extra hour of sleep. And the resulting shift in the bodys daily sleep-wake cycle can disrupt sleep for several days. Research teams around the world have tried to determine if losing or gaining an hour of sleep because of Daylight Saving Time make a difference in health. This spring, Michigan researchers, writing in the American Journal of Cardiology, showed a small increase in heart attacks on the first day (Sunday) of the spring transition to Daylight Saving Time, when we lose an hour of sleep. This echoed a Swedish study published in the New England Journal of Medicineshowing a small increase in heart attacks after the start of Daylight Saving Time and a small decrease at its end. Other researchers have looked at driving accidents, workplace safety, and even school performance, with mixed results. Daylight Saving Time and sleep The focus on gaining or losing an hour of sleep overlooks the bigger picturethe effect of Daylight Saving Time transitions on the sleep cycle. An excellent review in the journal Sleep Medicine Reviews by Dr. Yvonne Harrison, a senior lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University in England, concludes that a seemingly small one-hour shift in the sleep cycle can affect sleep for up to a week. In the Fall, only a minority of people actually get that promised extra hour of sleep. During the following week, many people wake up earlier, have more trouble falling asleep, and are more likely to wake up during the night. People who tend to be so-called short sleepers, logging under 7.5 hours a night, and early risers (also known as larks), have the most trouble adjusting to the new schedule. Similar problems are seen in the Spring. Again, the adjustment is harder for larks and short sleepers. Springing back Each of us experiences predictable physical, mental, and behavioral changes during the course of a day. These are called circadian rhythms. The daily cycle of light and dark keep them on a 24-hour cycle. Sleep is a component of circadian rhythms. It is affected by outside influences, like light or Daylight Saving time. It can also affect the bodys other rhythms. Its difficult to side-step the effects of Daylight Saving time on sleep. My advice is to be aware that it can take your circadian and sleep rhythms a week or so to get adjusted to the new clock. Regular exercise, preferably at the same time each day, may help get your sleep cycle back on track. Going to bed and getting up on a schedule can help. And giving in to brief afternoon nap or two during the week may be a pleasant and relaxing way to restore lost sleep.

 Never remembered nightmares or even having them i was told i woke up either yelling or screaming at someone The last few weeks i have been remembering some of nightmares and last one it was very very disturbing and graphic I wish there was a way to stop these nightmares from happening, someone i know takes meds to help them stop but that too has not been working for her. Why does the mind not let go of all the trauma after it has been released as a dream you would think it would stop alreay and not replay over and over each night 
 Apples iOS 9.3 update might help you sleep better By Nicole Bogart, Globalnews.ca January 12, 2016 Apple is known to throw in some pretty useful features when it updates its mobile operating system, from battery improvements to smarter notifications. But with iOS 9.3, the tech giant hopes to give you a better nights sleep. No, your iPhone wont be able to sing you a lullaby, or cuddle you to sleep  but the update will include a new feature called Night Shift, which will change the colours of the light emitted from your device based on the time of day. Night Shift will use your iPhone or iPads clock and geolocation to determine when its sunset. Then it will automatically shift the colours to the warmer end of the spectrum, making it easier on your eyes in the dark. Why will this help me sleep better? Multiple studies have shown that using blue light-emitting devices before bed can affect how we sleep. We know light affects our day-night cycle, or our circadian rhythm, but particularly the short-wave or blue light from cellphones has a strong impact, said Global News medical contributor Dr. Samir Gupta. The light emitted from a smartphone or tablet, for example, can suppress the production of melatonin  a hormone that regulates a persons circadian rhythm. One study, completed in 2014, compared the effects of reading an e-book versus a regular paper book before bed. Those who read on light-emitting devices took longer to fall asleep and had less REM  the stage of sleep you do most of your active dreaming in  than those who read the paper book. The study also found those who read on a light-emitting device took longer to wake up and were sleepier the next day. By transitioning your iPhone or iPads screen to a warmer hue, Apple hopes this new feature will make it easier on your eyes. However, that doesnt mean its a cure. I dont know if the latest changes that Apple is proposing would reduce or illuminate blue light, but I am doubtful. This is something you would need to look into but I think the way the display works would make it impossible to eliminate the blue light issue, Gupta said. The iOS 9.3 update was recently made available to developers, which means it will be a few weeks before the public will be able to download the update. In the meantime, you might want to think about setting yourself a digital bedtime. Most experts recommend you should avoid looking at screens of any type  yes that means smartphones, tablets and TVs  at least an hour before bedtime. 
 A Lineman in My Bed: Notes on Teeth Grinding By PAUL VanDeCARR, New York Times November 13, 2007 I grind my teeth at night. Have for years. Its my secret shame. But now I have the comfort of knowing that at least 8 to 10 percent of the adult population shares my malady. Its called sleep bruxism, and it refers to the grinding or clenching of teeth. Theres a waking version, too  an unconscious clenching of the teeth, most often owing to stress  but the origins are different and the effects are seldom anywhere near as bad as during sleep, when certain of the bodys protective mechanisms are turned off. Left untreated, it can cause damage to the teeth and surrounding tissue, headaches and jaw pain. Bruxism may be at least as old as the Bible, which describes hell as a state where there is gnashing of teeth. I might fairly be accused of hyperbole if I reversed the equation and declared that bruxism can turn sleep into a kind of hell. But you get the idea. Its a real nuisance. Its much like having a large football player standing on the tooth, says Dr. Noshir Mehta, chairman of general dentistry at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine and director of its Craniofacial Pain Center. During sleep bruxism, he explained, the upper and lower teeth may come into direct contact as much as 40 minutes per hour, and  for example, on the first molar  with a force of about 250 pounds. Hence the football player. Compare that with normal circumstances, when a persons teeth make contact for about 20 minutes a day, while chewing, and with only 20 to 40 pounds of pressure. Even if I wanted a football player in my bed, I certainly wouldnt want him standing on my teeth. I became aware of his presence the way that many bruxers do. My then-boyfriend told me I woke him up with a dreadful crunching noise that came from grinding; my dentist saw the wear patterns on my teeth and confirmed the diagnosis. Sleep bruxism is not a disease, but a common sleep disorder. It is more prevalent in children, who often outgrow it, and its origins may be different in adults. The exact causes are unknown, said Dr. Gilles Lavigne. If anyone would know, its Dr. Lavigne, a professor of dentistry and medicine at the University of Montreal, and president of the Canadian Sleep Society who has published extensively on the topic. In the 1960s, he explains, bruxism was thought to be the bodys response to malocclusion, or problems with how the upper and lower teeth fit together; but that theory was discredited for lack of clinical evidence. Stress was later thought to be the cause, but this failed to explain why not everyone with sleep bruxism was stressed and not everyone with stress ground their teeth. More recent research indicates some relationship of sleep bruxism to neurochemicals like dopamine, but there is still disagreement on how significant a role they play. Dr. Lavignes latest studies have identified a pattern of activation in the autonomic nervous system that correlates strongly with sleep bruxism. (He emphasizes that sleep bruxism is not an indicator of neurological disease.) Whatever underlying causes science may show in time, and they may be several, the more immediate contributing factors for sleep bruxism are better understood. The medical literature shows that stress, smoking, alcohol, caffeine and other factors may set off or worsen the condition. So whats a grinder to do? Right away, my dentist suggested fitting me with a mouth guard, a small plastic device that covers some or all of the teeth to protect them against damage, but does not stop the grinding or clenching itself. Unable to afford the $300 price tag at the time, I got an over-the-counter version at the drugstore for $20. The over-the-counter guards are usually better than nothing, said Dr. Charles McNeill, director of the Center for Orofacial Pain at the University of California, San Francisco. They protect the teeth, he says, but may also be more likely to induce a chewing response and increase bruxism; they can also cause irreversible damage to the bite, or arrangement of the teeth, and so should be used only temporarily. Guards made by a dentist last longer, fit better and are generally designed to distribute the force of grinding to reduce jaw pain. Feeling frustrated about my persistent bruxism, I was determined to find a way to stop altogether. Having started grinding during an especially hectic period in my life, I assumed that it was caused by stress. I tried relaxation techniques like yoga, exercise, biofeedback and hypnotherapy. Much as these may have helped my overall health, they didnt seem to kick the football player out of my bed. Besides, even well after the initial stressor had passed, I was still grinding. So I did what any reasonable person would do: I turned to drugs. The medical literature on bruxism showed that anti-anxiety medications like buspirone and clonazepam had worked on some patients; buspirone only made me jittery, but clonazepam brought my bruxism to, well, a grinding halt. Clonazepam would be a fantastic treatment, but its potentially habit-forming; it works too well, said Dr. Michael Gelb, a clinical professor at the New York University College of Dentistry. The better the pharmacological treatment works, the more fraught it is with difficulty. In two months, I became habituated to the drug and its effect began to diminish. I now use it only occasionally. So much for drugs. Throughout, I paid attention to which factors seemed to worsen my clenching and grinding, like alcohol and poor sleep habits, and cut back where necessary. On my dentists recommendation, I also tried out the NTI-tss device, a hard plastic splint that for some people substantially reduces the intensity of clenching and associated headaches. But I was evidently such an insistent bruxer that I outwitted the principle on which it is based. Finally, I came back to where I started: I got a mouth guard that covers all my teeth, this time custom-fitted by my dentist. Id abandoned hope of ending my bruxism until I met a woman recently who stopped 10 years grinding after a year of regular acupuncture treatments. I was encouraged enough to try acupuncture myself, and have noticed some improvement after a few months of weekly sessions. Acupuncture has not been clinically proved to cure or calm bruxism, but Im willing to hang my hopes on anecdotal evidence that suggests it helps. Though I didnt know it at the time, I had tried most of the approaches recommended for bruxism, albeit with less success than many people enjoy. Dr. Lavigne, of the Canadian Sleep Society, says people who wake up with headaches or jaw pain may clench or grind their teeth, and should consult their dentist, or doctors at a university-affiliated oral-facial pain center. There, patients may be directed to try some of the techniques I used, or others, and may be assessed for associated conditions like snoring. These approaches may reduce bruxism, but since there is no known cure, only the effects can be reliably treated. In the end, mouth guards are still the best defense. After all, if youre going to square off against a football player every night, you need padding. 
 New Recommendations to Achieve Healthy Sleep Medscape Medical News June 30, 2015 The American Thoracic Society (ATS) has released a policy statement with recommendations for clinicians and the general public on achieving good-quality sleep and getting enough sleep. "Sleep plays a vital role in human health, yet there is a lack of sufficient guidance on promoting good sleep health," said Sutapa Mukherjee, MBBS, PhD, chair of the ATS committee that produced the document. "In this statement, with an eye towards improving public health, we address the importance of good quality sleep with a focus on sleep health in adults and children; the effects of work schedules on sleep; the impact of drowsy driving; and the diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia." The statement is published in the June 15 issue of the American Thoracic Society's American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. Key recommendations include the following: Good-quality sleep is critical for good health and overall quality of life.Short sleep duration (6 hours or less per 24-hour period) is associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality.Long sleep duration (>9 to 10 hours per 24-hour period) may also be associated with adverse health outcomes.The optimal sleep duration in adults for good health at a population level is 7 to 9 hours, although individual variability exists.Because drowsy driving is an important cause of fatal and nonfatal motor vehicle crashes, all drivers (occupational and nonoccupational) should receive education about how to recognize the symptoms and consequences of drowsiness.Better education is needed for the general public and healthcare providers regarding the effect of working hours and shift work on sleep duration and quality and the association of sleepiness with workplace injuries.Sleep disorders are common, cause significant morbidity, and have substantial economic impact, but they are treatable. However, many individuals with sleep disorders remain undiagnosed and untreated.Age-based recommendations for sleep duration in children should be developed. These should enable the child to awaken spontaneously at the desired time through implementation of regular wake and sleep schedules.For adolescents, school start times should be delayed to align with physiologic circadian propensity of this age group.Healthcare providers should receive more education on sleep hygiene and encourage patients to maximize their sleep time.Public education programs should be developed to emphasize the importance of sleep for good health.Better education/awareness is needed of the importance of early identification of groups at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (in children and adults).Better education of physicians as to the effectiveness of cognitive-behavior therapy for insomnia rather than immediate implementation of hypnotics and sedatives, and structural changes to increase access to this therapy.

 CBT Effective for Chronic Insomnia Medscape Medical News June 12, 2015 Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can improve sleep in patients with chronic insomnia without recourse to drugs or experiencing adverse outcomes, the results of a meta-analysis reveal. The study, which included data from 20 studies of CBT in chronic insomnia, showed improvements on a range of sleep measures immediately following treatment, with some data indicating that there were further gains over time. "This supports recommendations that CBT [for insomnia] should be used as the initial intervention for chronic insomnia when possible," the investigators, led by James M. Trauer, MD, Melbourne Sleep Disorders Centre, East Melbourne, Australia, write. The study was published online June 9 in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Continued Improvement Dr Trauer explained that he and his colleagues undertook the research after looking at the profile of the patients in his sleep clinic. "We were interested by the fact that a lot of our patients with insomnia have quite a lot of medical treatments, and often vitamins and supplements, but haven't ever tried psychological treatments such as CBT for insomnia," he said. "A lot of the patients we see with insomnia describe having been on the Internet, tried sleep hygiene, tried various sleep tablets that have been prescribed by their GP, but they've never even heard of CBT for insomnia," Dr Trauer added. To examine the impact of the use of CBT for insomnia on diary measures of overnight sleep in adults with chronic insomnia, the researchers conducted a search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsyhINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and the PubMed Clinical Queries databases. Of 292 initial citations, 20 randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of face-to-face multimodal CBT vs comparator control groups in patients with chronic insomnia who were without comorbid conditions were selected, yielding a total of 1162 participants (mean age, 56 years). The various CBT approaches used in the studies included cognitive therapy, stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, and relaxation. Each study investigated CBT with at least three components. Results revealed that at posttreatment, sleep onset latency improved by a mean of 19.03 minutes with CBT, and wake after sleep onset improved by a mean of 26.00 minutes. In addition, total sleep time improved by 7.61 minutes, and there was a 9.91% improvement in sleep efficiency with CBT. Importantly, no adverse outcomes were reported with CBT. In performing the meta-analysis, the investigators found there was little consistency in follow-up, which made it difficult to determine the longer-term impact of CBT on insomnia. "Having said that, there were some data on that, and we think that a signal is beginning to emerge that, months down the track, you continue to maintain the gains that you made with the treatment, and those gains then even augment or get greater with time from the original treatment," Dr Trauer noted. "For example, for the total amount of time that patients are sleeping, it really didn't change very much immediately after the treatment, but months down the track, it looks as if it has improved significantly by half an hour or more after several months. That's consistent with how we understand the treatment to work," he added. In order for CBT to be more widely implemented, Dr Trauer believes there needs to be increased awareness and availability of CBT for insomnia. "For a lot of patients, even if they have heard of it, it's pretty difficult to access the treatment. One of the reasons for that, I suppose, is that the classic model is one-on-one treatment, and that's the studies that we included in our meta-analysis," he said. "It consists of one-on-one treatment for generally a period of an hour, with four to six sessions with a psychologist, and, given that insomnia is so widespread, if you adopt that model and try to roll it out to all of the population with insomnia, it's going to be difficult to provide those kinds of resources, because about 10% of the population has insomnia." Cultural Shift Needed In an accompanying editorial, Charles M. Morin, PhD, Université Laval, Quebec, Canada, notes that other studies have indicated that psychological therapies can produce sleep improvements in patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions, which is a common occurrence with insomnia. Speaking to Medscape Medical News, Dr Morin said that regardless of whether or not a patient with insomnia has comorbid conditions, the recommendation is the same. "We used to think that if insomnia was presenting, let's say, in the context of a depression, that we just needed to treat the depression and it would take care of the sleep problems. But oftentimes that was not the case," he said. "We could treat effectively the depression, but insomnia was the most common residual symptom, and oftentimes the persistence of that residual symptom would increase the relapse rate for depression." He continued: "Now, clearly the paradigm is different, and most experts would say that we need to treat both conditions...and the overall results will be much better in the end." Dr Morin believes that a cultural shift is required for CBT to become more widely used in the treatment of insomnia, alongside a change in the way in which CBT is reimbursed. "As long as we continue reimbursing medication treatment with a medical doctor but we don't for psychological treatment with a psychologist, I think that we are in trouble, because we are taking a very narrow view of how to take care of these kinds of problems," he said. "The medication is more like a Band-Aid, so in the short run, that's fine, but in the long run, we need to do CBT to address the underlying issues that perpetuate this sleep problem." Another barrier against the adoption of CBT is linked to education. Dr Morin stated: "We don't do a great deal of education about sleep and the importance of sleep." "If we only allow enough time in graduate school, in medical school to talk about sleep the way we do about nutrition, about exercise, then maybe people would pay more attention." Talking more generally about public health education programs, Dr Morin observed that "we don't hear a lot about sleep except maybe when a drug company brings a new medication on the market." "At least in Canada, we hear a lot about the importance about good nutrition, a good diet, about the importance of exercising to stay fit, but sleep occupies a third of our lives, and we really don't hear a lot about it, so we take it for granted until we start having sleep problems," he added. One way in which the case for CBT could be strengthened would be to link it to the poor clinical outcomes that are observed in people who suffer from chronic insomnia. Dr Morin pointed out that there are long-term epidemiologic studies documenting the impact of persistent insomnia, such as depression and hypertension. "Now what we need to do in terms of studies is to do long-term studies and not only aim at improving sleep but aim at reducing this negative health outcome," he said. He added that things are moving in the "right direction," because it is no longer taken for granted that the sleep problem will "go away" if, for example, a patient is treated for depression. "We just need to do a bit more different research, and probably need to do a bit more lobbying with the government and agencies and healthcare insurance companies," said Dr Morin. The authors' financial disclosures can be found in the original study. Ann Intern Med. Published online June 9, 2015. Abstract, Editorial 
 Taking Melatonin Correctly for Night Owls Marks Psychiatry Retrieved February 28, 2013 People who are charged up in the evenings can spend a lifetime battling their body’s natural drive to go to sleep later. Low dose melatonin at 0.3 mg – 1 mg taken 3-4 hours before bedtime can help you fall asleep earlier in the evenings. 
 I have had a hard time getting to sleep for years and have been taking 5 mg. of Ambien, and yet I can fall to sleep during the day with a book or the TV on. Recently I have not been able to get back to sleep when I awake in the middle of the night. Thing is I have started to begin dreaming on Ambien, and so just as I awake in the middle of the night, I am also in the middle of a dream. So I get up to use the restroom, but now when I go back to bed instead of getting another 5 mg. of Ambien, I decide to see if I can finish the dream. This puts me back to sleep since I am thinking of trying to continue my dream. If I was having dreams of being chased by a bad man like I used to dream, this wouldn't be easy. Last night my dream was wonderful. I was riding a bike out of town, and for some reason I got off my bike, leaving my purse and shoes with it. I started to walk back to my bike, but must have taken another road. I came upon the outskirts of our town, but a part of town I had never seen. It looks more like England (I had been watching James Herriot series.), and then a Chinese woman helped me get through the town. I was thinking how much I would love my husband to see this town and to eat lunch in it. Then she climbed some rocks and jumped in a pool in town. She wanted me to join, but I told her that I had to get home, and if I can't find my way I would ask to use a phone and have my husband come and get me. What a nice travel dream. I hope to continue to get to sleep this way and hope to someday figure out how to get off Ambien altogether. Reading a book doesn't help at night even though I don't read exciting books then. 
 FDA OKs New Kind of Sleep Drug Suvorexant (Belsomra) Medscape Medical News August 13, 2014 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today approved a first-in-class insomnia drug called suvorexant (Belsomra, Merck) after the manufacturer lowered the dosages to satisfy the agency's safety concerns. Last July, Merck announced that the FDA had declined to approve suvorexant until the starting dose for most patients was 10 mg. The agency also said that proposed upper-limit doses of 30 mg for elderly patients and 40 mg for nonelderly patients were unsafe. In a news release today, the FDA said it had approved suvorexant at 4 different strengths — 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg. The total dosage in 1 day should not exceed 20 mg. Merck noted in its own news release today that the recommended dose is 10 mg for most patients, just as the FDA insisted. Suvorexant, an orexin receptor antagonist, is the first drug of its kind to be approved for patients with insomnia. It alters the signaling of orexins, neurotransmitters responsible for regulating the sleep-wake cycle. The FDA determined that suvorexant was effective based on 3 clinical trials involving more than 500 participants. Those receiving suvorexant nodded off more quickly and spent less time awake for the rest of the night compared with participants given a placebo. Drowsiness was the most commonly reported adverse event for clinical trial participants taking suvorexant, which is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance. In next-day driving tests that the FDA asked Merck to perform, both male and female participants who took the 20-mg dose proved to be impaired drivers. The FDA advises physicians to caution patients at this dosage level against next-day driving or other activities requiring full alertness. Patients taking lower doses also should know about the risk for impaired driving the day after because sensitivity to the drug varies from person to person. "Using the lowest effective dose can reduce the risk of side effects, including next-morning drowsiness," said Ellis Unger, MD, director of the Office of Drug Evaluation I in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in the agency's news release. More information about today's decision is available on the FDA Web site. Not approved by Health Canada as of this date August 20, 2014 
 Insufficient Sleep Is a Public Health Epidemic CDC August 2014 Continued public health surveillance of sleep quality, duration, behaviors, and disorders is needed to monitor sleep difficulties and their health impact. Sleep is increasingly recognized as important to public health, with sleep insufficiency linked to motor vehicle crashes, industrial disasters, and medical and other occupational errors.1 Unintentionally falling asleep, nodding off while driving, and having difficulty performing daily tasks because of sleepiness all may contribute to these hazardous outcomes. Persons experiencing sleep insufficiency are also more likely to suffer from chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, depression, and obesity, as well as from cancer, increased mortality, and reduced quality of life and productivity.1 Sleep insufficiency may be caused by broad scale societal factors such as round-the-clock access to technology and work schedules, but sleep disorders such as insomnia or obstructive sleep apnea also play an important role.1 An estimated 50-70 million US adults have sleep or wakefulness disorder1. Notably, snoring is a major indicator of obstructive sleep apnea. dsSleep_270px.jpg In recognition of the importance of sleep to the nation's health, CDC surveillance of sleep-related behaviors has increased in recent years. Additionally, the Institute of Medicine encouraged collaboration between CDC and the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research to support development and expansion of adequate surveillance of the U.S. population's sleep patterns and associated outcomes. Two new reports on the prevalence of unhealthy sleep behaviors and self-reported sleep-related difficulties among U.S. adults provide further evidence that insufficient sleep is an important public health concern. Sleep-Related Unhealthy Behaviors The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey included a core question regarding perceived insufficient rest or sleep in 2008 (included since 1995 on the Health Related Quality of Life module) and an optional module of four questions on sleep behavior in 2009. Data from the 2009 BRFSS Sleep module were used to assess the prevalence of unhealthy/sleep behaviors by selected sociodemographic factors and geographic variations in 12 states. The analysis[PDF - 1.1MB] determined that, among 74,571 adult respondents in 12 states, 35.3% reported <7 hours of sleep during a typical 24-hour period, 48.0% reported snoring, 37.9% reported unintentionally falling asleep during the day at least once in the preceding month, and 4.7% reported nodding off or falling asleep while driving at least once in the preceding month. This is the first CDC surveillance report to include estimates of drowsy driving and unintentionally falling asleep during the day. The National Department of Transportation estimates drowsy driving to be responsible for 1,550 fatalities and 40,000 nonfatal injuries annually in the United States.2 dssleep_626px.jpg Self-reported Sleep-related Difficulties Among Adults The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) introduced the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire in 2005 for participants 16 years of age and older. This analysis [PDF - 1.1MB] was conducted using data from the last two survey cycles (2005–2006 and 2007–2008) to include 10,896 respondents aged ≥20 years. A short sleep duration was found to be more common among adults ages 20–39 years (37.0%) or 40–59 years (40.3%) than among adults aged ≥60 years (32.0%), and among non-Hispanic blacks (53.0%) compared to non-Hispanic whites (34.5%), Mexican-Americans (35.2%), or those of other race/ethnicity (41.7%). Adults who reported sleeping less than the recommended 7–9 hours per night were more likely to have difficulty performing many daily tasks. How Much Sleep Do We Need? And How Much Sleep Are We Getting? How much sleep we need varies between individuals but generally changes as we age. The National Institutes of Health suggests that school-age children need at least 10 hours of sleep daily, teens need 9-105 hours, and adults need 7-8 hours. According to data from the National Health Interview Survey, nearly 30% of adults reported an average of ≤6 hours of sleep per day in 2005-2007.3 In 2009, only 31% of high school students reported getting at least 8 hours of sleep on an average school night.4 Sleep Hygiene Tips The promotion of good sleep habits and regular sleep is known as sleep hygiene. The following sleep hygiene tips can be used to improve sleep. Go to bed at the same time each night and rise at the same time each morning.Avoid large meals before bedtime.Avoid caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime.Avoid nicotine.

 SELF-SHIATSU MIGHT HELP YOU SLEEP UHN University Health Network July 29, 2014 Leisa Bellmore, Shiatsu Therapist in the Artists Health Centre at Toronto Western Hospital demonstrates how to perform self-shiatsu on the hand to help with sleep. There are so many tips and myths surrounding what it takes to get a good night's sleep. Does a warm glass of milk help you drift off easier? Or will counting sheep actually help you fall asleep? While trouble sleeping can affect everyone at one point or another, for people with chronic pain sleep problems are a nightly issue. According to a 2003 global study of pain prevalence by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), "chronic pain is among the most disabling and costly afflictions in North America, Europe, and Australia." Relationship between chronic pain and sleep Leisa Bellmore, a shiatsu therapist in the Artists' Health Centre at Toronto Western Hospital, is hoping her pilot study on hand self-shiatsu is the beginning of helping people with chronic pain get a better night's sleep. "There's a bi-directional relationship between chronic pain and sleep," said Bellmore. "If you have chronic pain, sleep deficiency is more likely, and if you're not sleeping that can sustain chronic pain." Sense receptors in hands Published in the Journal of Integrative Medicine, the study focuses on participants administering shiatsu on their own hands for 10-15 minutes every night. "We focused on the hands for several reasons," said Bellmore. "The hands are easily accessible and we have lots of sense receptors in our hands, but most importantly people can do it themselves." People dealing with chronic pain often feel like they lack control over their own bodies and their overall health. Self-management from being able to administer their own therapy can lead to more positive feelings about their health. Traditional Chinese Medicine Shiatsu is based on the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Shiatsu practitioners apply thumb and finger pressure to different points on the soft tissues of the body in order to assess and treat a variety of conditions. For the study, occupational therapy and physical therapy students were taught the basic shiatsu techniques and in turn trained participants. For those who want to try hand self-shiatsu as a sleep intervention, Bellmore recommends repeating the patterns three times on the areas on the back of the hand and the palm, as well as on the top, bottom, and sides of the fingers to get the best results. Falling asleep faster Twelve participants completed the study and Bellmore says some reported falling asleep faster  sometimes even while administering treatment. Participants also said they woke up less during the night at the two week and eight week follow-ups. While the study focused on people with chronic pain, Bellmore says in theory anyone experiencing difficulty sleeping could trade counting sheep for hand self-shiatsu. "The benefits of this method are that it's a non-pharmaceutical intervention, there are no side effects, it's not invasive or painful to administer, it's cost-effective, and the hand is easily accessible to people who may have limited range of motion," said Bellmore. Avoid certain activities Whether you suffer with chronic pain or just occasionally have trouble sleeping, Bellmore recommends avoiding certain activities that can make it harder to fall asleep. "A lot of people watch TV in bed or use their computer late at night, which is terrible," said Bellmore. There has also been a lot written about how exercise can generate a better night's sleep, but she says that's not always the case. "Exercising raises your core body temperature, increases your heart rate, and prompts your system to release adrenaline," she explains. "So if you exercise late in the evening or just before bed it actually has the opposite effect." Smoking or eating a heavy meal late at night and even a stream of light coming through a door or window can all be added to the list of things that can disrupt sleep," said Bellmore. Bellmore worked with Cary Brown and Geoff Bostick of the University of Alberta on the pilot study. While the study had a small sample size, Bellmore is encouraged by the results. She says she hopes to expand the study to include more participants to get a better idea of the effects of hand self-shiatsu as a sleep intervention strategy.

 Twelve Simple Tips to Improve Your Sleep Harvard Division of Sleep Medicine July 2014 Falling asleep may seem like an impossible dream when youre awake at 3 a.m., but good sleep is more under your control than you might think. Following healthy sleep habits can make the difference between restlessness and restful slumber. Researchers have identified a variety of practices and habitsknown as sleep hygiene"that can help anyone maximize the hours they spend sleeping, even those whose sleep is affected by insomnia, jet lag, or shift work. Sleep hygiene may sound unimaginative, but it just may be the best way to get the sleep you need in this 24/7 age. Here are some simple tips for making the sleep of your dreams a nightly reality: #1 Avoid Caffeine, Alcohol, Nicotine, and Other Chemicals that Interfere with Sleep Caffeinated products decrease a persons quality of sleep. As any coffee lover knows, caffeine is a stimulant that can keep you awake. So avoid caffeine (found in coffee, tea, chocolate, cola, and some pain relievers) for four to six hours before bedtime. Similarly, smokers should refrain from using tobacco products too close to bedtime. Although alcohol may help bring on sleep, after a few hours it acts as a stimulant, increasing the number of awakenings and generally decreasing the quality of sleep later in the night. It is therefore best to limit alcohol consumption to one to two drinks per day, or less, and to avoid drinking within three hours of bedtime. #2 Turn Your Bedroom into a Sleep-Inducing Environment A quiet, dark, and cool environment can help promote sound slumber. Why do you think bats congregate in caves for their daytime sleep? To achieve such an environment, lower the volume of outside noise with earplugs or a "white noise" appliance. Use heavy curtains, blackout shades, or an eye mask to block light, a powerful cue that tells the brain that it's time to wake up. Keep the temperature comfortably coolbetween 60 and 75°Fand the room well ventilated. And make sure your bedroom is equipped with a comfortable mattress and pillows. (Remember that most mattresses wear out after ten years.) Also, if a pet regularly wakes you during the night, you may want to consider keeping it out of your bedroom. It may help to limit your bedroom activities to sleep and sex only. Keeping computers, TVs, and work materials out of the room will strengthen the mental association between your bedroom and sleep. #3 Establish a Soothing Pre-Sleep Routine Light reading before bed is a good way to prepare yourself for sleep. Ease the transition from wake time to sleep time with a period of relaxing activities an hour or so before bed. Take a bath (the rise, then fall in body temperature promotes drowsiness), read a book, watch television, or practice relaxation exercises. Avoid stressful, stimulating activitiesdoing work, discussing emotional issues. Physically and psychologically stressful activities can cause the body to secrete the stress hormone cortisol, which is associated with increasing alertness. If you tend to take your problems to bed, try writing them downand then putting them aside. #4 Go to Sleep When Youre Truly Tired Struggling to fall sleep just leads to frustration. If youre not asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed, go to another room, and do something relaxing, like reading or listening to music until you are tired enough to sleep. #5 Dont Be a Nighttime Clock-Watcher Staring at a clock in your bedroom, either when you are trying to fall asleep or when you wake in the middle of the night, can actually increase stress, making it harder to fall asleep. Turn your clocks face away from you. And if you wake up in the middle of the night and cant get back to sleep in about 20 minutes, get up and engage in a quiet, restful activity such as reading or listening to music. And keep the lights dim; bright light can stimulate your internal clock. When your eyelids are drooping and you are ready to sleep, return to bed. #6 Use Light to Your Advantage Natural light keeps your internal clock on a healthy sleep-wake cycle. So let in the light first thing in the morning and get out of the office for a sun break during the day. #7 Keep Your Internal Clock Set with a Consistent Sleep Schedule Having a regular sleep schedule helps to ensure better quality and consistent sleep. Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day sets the bodys "internal clock" to expect sleep at a certain time night after night. Try to stick as closely as possible to your routine on weekends to avoid a Monday morning sleep hangover. Waking up at the same time each day is the very best way to set your clock, and even if you did not sleep well the night before, the extra sleep drive will help you consolidate sleep the following night. Learn more about the importance of synchronizing the clock in The Drive to Sleep and Our Internal Clock. #8 Nap EarlyOr Not at All Many people make naps a regular part of their day. However, for those who find falling asleep or staying asleep through the night problematic, afternoon napping may be one of the culprits. This is because late-day naps decrease sleep drive. If you must nap, its better to keep it short and before 5 p.m. #9 Lighten Up on Evening Meals Eating a pepperoni pizza at 10 p.m. may be a recipe for insomnia. Finish dinner several hours before bedtime and avoid foods that cause indigestion. If you get hungry at night, snack on foods that (in your experience) won't disturb your sleep, perhaps dairy foods and carbohydrates. #10 Balance Fluid Intake Drink enough fluid at night to keep from waking up thirstybut not so much and so close to bedtime that you will be awakened by the need for a trip to the bathroom. #11 Exercise Early Exercise helps promote restful sleep if it is done several hours before you go to bed. Exercise can help you fall asleep faster and sleep more soundlyas long as it's done at the right time. Exercise stimulates the body to secrete the stress hormone cortisol, which helps activate the alerting mechanism in the brain. This is fine, unless you're trying to fall asleep. Try to finish exercising at least three hours before bed or work out earlier in the day. #12 Follow Through Some of these tips will be easier to include in your daily and nightly routine than others. However, if you stick with them, your chances of achieving restful sleep will improve. That said, not all sleep problems are so easily treated and could signify the presence of a sleep disorder such as apnea, restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy, or another clinical sleep problem. If your sleep difficulties dont improve through good sleep hygiene, you may want to consult your physician or a sleep specialist. Learn more at When to Seek Treatment. 
 I'm having really bad night terrors and night sweats at the moment! It's a vicious circle, I have these awful nightmares and wake up screaming and crying, but I feel so warn out I need more sleep, the more I sleep, the more its happening! The thing that worries me the most is that I can remember everything that I dream about and it takes me ages to stop thinking about them, I don't know why, I just feel that if I could sort them out in my head, maybe the night terrors would go away for a while!! It's not working right now though!! I also am a bit freaked out because i am regularly suffering from 'de ja vue' (forgive me if its spelled wrong, i hope you know what i mean though?) Its a strange and scary thing to be continuously thinking that things have already happened and feeling like you are losing the plot!! 
 Scientists identify the switch that says it's time to sleep University of Oxford News February 19, 2014 The switch in the brain that sends us off to sleep has been identified by researchers at Oxford Universitys Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour in a study in fruit flies. The switch works by regulating the activity of a handful of sleep-promoting nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain. The neurons fire when were tired and need sleep, and dampen down when were fully rested. When youre tired, these neurons in the brain shout loud and they send you to sleep, says Professor Gero Miesenböck of Oxford University, in whose laboratory the new research was performed. Although the research was carried out in fruit flies, or Drosophila, the scientists say the sleep mechanism is likely to be relevant to humans. Dr Jeffrey Donlea, one of the lead authors of the study, explains: There is a similar group of neurons in a region of the human brain. These neurons are also electrically active during sleep and, like the flies cells, are the targets of general anaesthetics that put us to sleep. Its therefore likely that a molecular mechanism similar to the one we have discovered in flies also operates in humans. The researchers say that pinpointing the sleep switch might help us identify new targets for novel drugs  potentially to improve treatments for sleep disorders. But there is much still to find out, and further research could give insight into the big unanswered question of why we need to sleep at all, they say. The big question now is to figure out what internal signal the sleep switch responds to, says Dr Diogo Pimentel of Oxford University, the other lead author of the study. What do these sleep-promoting cells monitor while we are awake? If we knew what happens in the brain during waking that requires sleep to reset, we might get closer to solving the mystery of why all animals need to sleep. The findings are reported in the journal Neuron. The work of the Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour is funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Gatsby Charitable Foundation. This study was also supported by the UK Medical Research Council, the US National Institutes of Health, and the Human Frontier Science Program. The body uses two mechanisms to regulate sleep. One is the body clock, which attunes humans and animals to the 24 hour cycle of day and night. The other mechanism is the sleep homeostat: a device in the brain that keeps track of your waking hours and puts you to sleep when you need to reset. This mechanism represents an internal nodding off point that is separate from external factors. When it is turned off or out of use, sleep deficits build up. What makes us go to sleep at night is probably a combination of the two mechanisms, says Professor Miesenböck. The body clock says its the right time, and the sleep switch has built up pressure during a long waking day. The work in fruit flies allowed the critical part of the sleep switch to be discovered. We discovered mutant flies that couldnt catch up on their lost sleep after they had been kept awake all night, says Dr Jeffrey Donlea. Flies stop moving when they go to sleep and require more disturbance to get them up. Sleep-deprived flies are prone to nodding off and are cognitively impaired  they have severe learning and memory deficits, much as sleep loss in humans leads to problems. Professor Miesenböck says: The sleep homeostat is similar to the thermostat in your home. A thermostat measures temperature and switches on the heating if its too cold. The sleep homeostat measures how long a fly has been awake and switches on a small group of specialized cells in the brain if necessary. Its the electrical output of these nerve cells that puts the fly to sleep. In the mutant flies, the researchers were able to show a key molecular component of the electrical activity switch is broken and the sleep-inducing neurons are always off, causing insomnia. 
 Goodnight. Sleep Clean. By MARIA KONNIKOVAJAN, New York Times January 12, 2014 SLEEP seems like a perfectly fine waste of time. Why would our bodies evolve to spend close to one-third of our lives completely out of it, when we could instead be doing something useful or exciting? Something that would, as an added bonus, be less likely to get us killed back when we were sleeping on the savanna? Sleep is such a dangerous thing to do, when youre out in the wild, Maiken Nedergaard, a Danish biologist who has been leading research into sleep function at the University of Rochesters medical school, told me. It has to have a basic evolutional function. Otherwise it would have been eliminated. Weve known for some time that sleep is essential for forming and consolidating memories and that it plays a central role in the formation of new neuronal connections and the pruning of old ones. But that hardly seems enough to risk death-by-leopard-in-the-night. If sleep was just to remember what you did yesterday, that wouldnt be important enough, Dr. Nedergaard explains. In a series of new studies, published this fall in the journal Science, the Nedergaard lab may at last be shedding light on just what it is that would be important enough. Sleep, it turns out, may play a crucial role in our brains physiological maintenance. As your body sleeps, your brain is quite actively playing the part of mental janitor: Its clearing out all of the junk that has accumulated as a result of your daily thinking. Recall what happens to your body during exercise. You start off full of energy, but soon enough your breathing turns uneven, your muscles tire, and your stamina runs its course. Whats happening internally is that your body isnt able to deliver oxygen quickly enough to each muscle that needs it and instead creates needed energy anaerobically. And while that process allows you to keep on going, a side effect is the accumulation of toxic byproducts in your muscle cells. Those byproducts are cleared out by the bodys lymphatic system, allowing you to resume normal function without any permanent damage. The lymphatic system serves as the bodys custodian: Whenever waste is formed, it sweeps it clean. The brain, however, is outside its reach  despite the fact that your brain uses up about 20 percent of your bodys energy. How, then, does its waste  like beta-amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimers disease  get cleared? What happens to all the wrappers and leftovers that litter the room after any mental workout? Think about a fish tank, says Dr. Nedergaard. If you have a tank and no filter, the fish will eventually die. So, how do the brain cells get rid of their waste? Where is their filter? UNTIL a few years ago, the prevailing model was based on recycling: The brain got rid of its own waste, not only beta-amyloid but other metabolites, by breaking it down and recycling it at an individual cell level. When that process eventually failed, the buildup would result in age-related cognitive decline and diseases like Alzheimers. That didnt make sense to Dr. Nedergaard, who says that the brain is too busy to recycle all of its energy. Instead, she proposed a brain equivalent of the lymphatic system, a network of channels that cleared out toxins with watery cerebrospinal fluid. She called it the glymphatic system, a nod to its dependence on glial cells (the supportive cells in the brain that work largely to maintain homeostasis and protect neurons) and its function as a sort of parallel lymphatic system. She was hardly the first to think in those terms. It had been proposed about one hundred years ago, but they didnt have the tools to study it properly, she says. Now, however, with advanced microscopes and dyeing techniques, her team discovered that the brains interstitial space  the fluid-filled area between tissue cells that takes up about 20 percent of the brains total volume  was mainly dedicated to physically removing the cells daily waste. When members of Dr. Nedergaards team injected small fluorescent tracers into the cerebrospinal fluid of anesthetized mice, they found that the tracers quickly entered the brain  and, eventually, exited it  via specific, predictable routes. The next step was to see how and when, exactly, the glymphatic system did its work. We thought this cleaning process would require tremendous energy, Dr. Nedergaard says. And so we asked, maybe this is something we do when were sleeping, when the brain is really not processing information. In a series of new studies on mice, her team discovered exactly that: When the mouse brain is sleeping or under anesthesia, its busy cleaning out the waste that accumulated while it was awake. In a mouse brain, the interstitial space takes up less room than it does in ours, approximately 14 percent of the total volume. Dr. Nedergaard found that when the mice slept, it swelled to over 20 percent. As a result, the cerebrospinal fluid could not only flow more freely but it could also reach further into the brain. In an awake brain, it would flow only along the brains surface. Indeed, the awake flow was a mere 5 percent of the sleep flow. In a sleeping brain, waste was being cleared two times faster. We saw almost no inflow of cerebrospinal fluid into the brain when the mice were awake, but then when we anesthetized them, it started flowing. Its such a big difference I kept being afraid something was wrong, says Dr. Nedergaard. Similar work in humans is still in the future. Dr. Nedergaard is currently awaiting board approval to begin the equivalent study in adult brains in collaboration with the anesthesiologist Helene Benveniste at Stony Brook University. So far the glymphatic system has been identified as the neural housekeeper in baboons, dogs and goats. If anything, Dr. Nedergaard says, its more needed in a bigger brain. MODERN society is increasingly ill equipped to provide our brains with the requisite cleaning time. The figures are stark. Some 80 percent of working adults suffer to some extent from sleep deprivation. According to the National Sleep Foundation, adults should sleep seven to nine hours. On average, were getting one to two hours less sleep a night than we did 50 to 100 years ago and 38 minutes less on weeknights than we did as little as 10 years ago. Between 50 and 70 million people in the United States suffer from some form of chronic sleep disorder. When our sleep is disturbed, whatever the cause, our cleaning system breaks down. At the University of Pennsylvanias Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology, Sigrid Veasey has been focusing on precisely how restless nights disturb the brains normal metabolism. What happens to our cognitive function when the trash piles up? At the extreme end, the result could be the acceleration of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimers and Parkinsons. While we dont know whether sleep loss causes the disease, or the disease itself leads to sleep loss  what Dr. Veasey calls a classic chicken-and-egg problem  we do know that the two are closely connected. Along with the sleep disturbances that characterize neurodegenerative diseases, there is a buildup of the types of proteins that the glymphatic system normally clears out during regular sleep, like beta-amyloids and tau, both associated with Alzheimers and other types of dementia. To me, says Dr. Veasey, thats the most compelling part of the Nedergaard research. That the clearance for these is dramatically reduced from prolonged wakefulness. If we dont sleep well, we may be allowing the very things that cause neural degeneration to pile up unchecked. Even at the relatively more benign end  the all-nighter or the extra-stressful week when you caught only a few hours a night  sleep deprivation, as everyone who has experienced it knows, impedes our ability to concentrate, to pay attention to our environment and to analyze information creatively. When were sleep-deprived, we cant integrate or put together facts, as Dr. Veasey puts it. But there is a difference between the kind of fleeting sleep loss we sometimes experience and the chronic deprivation that comes from shift work, insomnia and the like. In one set of studies, soon to be published in The Journal of Neuroscience, the Veasey lab found that while our brains can recover quite readily from short-term sleep loss, chronic prolonged wakefulness and sleep disruption stresses the brains metabolism. The result is the degeneration of key neurons involved in alertness and proper cortical function and a buildup of proteins associated with aging and neural degeneration. Its like the difference between a snowstorms disrupting a single day of trash pickup and a prolonged strike. No longer quite as easy to fix, and even when the strike is over, theres likely to be some stray debris floating around for quite some time yet. Recovery from sleep loss is slower than wed thought, Dr. Veasey notes. We used to think that after a bit of recovery sleep, you should be fine. But this work shows youre not. If you put her own research together with the findings from the Nedergaard lab, Dr. Veasey says, it very clearly shows that theres impaired clearance in the awake brain. Were really starting to realize that when we skip sleep, we may be doing irreparable damage to the brain, prematurely aging it or setting it up for heightened vulnerability to other insults. In a society that is not only chronically sleep-deprived but also rapidly aging, thats bad news. Its unlikely that poor sleep as a child would actually cause Alzheimers or Parkinsons, says Dr. Veasey, but its more likely that you may shift one of those diseases by a decade or so. That has profound health and economic implications. Its a pernicious cycle. We work longer hours, become more stressed, sleep less, impair our brains ability to clean up after all that hard work, and become even less able to sleep soundly. And if we reach for a sleeping pill to help us along? While work on the effects of sleeping aids on the glymphatic system remains to be done, the sleep researchers I spoke with agree that theres no evidence that aided sleep is as effective as natural sleep. There is, however, reason to hope. If the main function of sleep is to take out our neural trash, that insight could eventually enable a new understanding of both neurodegenerative diseases and regular, age-related cognitive decline. By developing a diagnostic test to measure how well the glymphatic system functions, we could move one step closer to predicting someones risk of developing conditions like Alzheimers or other forms of dementia: The faster the fluids clear the decks, the more effectively the brains metabolism is functioning. Such a test could also be used in the emergency room after traumatic brain injury, Dr. Nedergaard says, to see who is at risk of developing decline in cognitive function. We can also focus on developing earlier, more effective interventions to prevent cognitive decline. One approach would be to enable individuals who suffer from sleep loss to sleep more soundly  but how? Dr. Nedergaards mice were able to clear their brains waste almost as effectively under anesthesia as under normal sleeping conditions. Thats really fascinating, says Dr. Veasey. Though current sleeping aids may not quite do the trick, and anesthetics are too dangerous for daily use, the results suggest that there may be better ways of improving sleep pharmacologically. Now that we have a better understanding of why sleep is so important, a new generation of drug makers can work to create the best possible environment for the trash pickup to occur in the first place  to make certain that our brains sleeping metabolism is as efficient as it can possibly be. A second approach would take the opposite tack, by seeking to mimic the cleanup-promoting actions of sleep in the awake brain, which could make a full night of sound sleep less necessary. To date, the brains metabolic process hasnt been targeted as such by the pharmaceutical industry. There simply wasnt enough evidence of its importance. In response to the evolving data, however, future drug interventions could focus directly on the glymphatic system, to promote the enhanced cleaning power of the sleeping brain in a brain that is fully awake. One day, scientists might be able to successfully mimic the expansion of the interstitial space that does the mental janitorial work so that we can achieve maximally efficient round-the-clock brain trash pickup. If that day comes, they would be on their way to discovering that all-time miracle drug: one that, in Dr. Veaseys joking words, could mean we never have to sleep at all. Maria Konnikova is the author of Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes. 
 Sleep duration predicts chronic depression and anxiety By Lucy Piper, MedwireNews 06 January 2014 J Clin Psychiatry 2013; Advance online publication Short and long sleep duration, but not insomnia, predict a chronic course of depressive and anxiety disorders independent of symptom severity, research indicates. Patients with persistent depression or anxiety were more likely to have insomnia than those without persistent disorders. However, insomnia was not independently associated with persistence after accounting for symptom severity. Our results also show that it is important to differentiate between insomnia and sleep duration, since there was no interaction effect between insomnia and sleep duration, the researchers note in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. They studied 1069 individuals aged an average of 42.7 years with DSM-IV-diagnosed depression or anxiety, 59% of whom had insomnia, diagnosed as a Womens Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale score of 9 or above. At 2-year follow-up, persistent depressive and/or anxiety disorder, according to the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, was seen in 61.1% of patients. Patients who reported sleeping an average of 10 hours or more per night were a significant 2.52 times more likely to have persistent (6-month diagnosis) depression and/or anxiety over 2 years of follow-up than patients who reported sleeping for a normal 7 to 9 hours per night. This was after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, chronic medical disorders, psychotropic medication, and symptom severity. Those who reported short sleep durations of 6 hours or less per night were a significant 1.64 times more likely to have persistent depression and/or anxiety, but, as with insomnia, significance was lost after adjustment for symptom severity. Both long and short sleep duration were also independently associated with a chronic course (no remission, and at least mild symptoms for 2 years of follow-up) of depression and/or anxiety, increasing the risk a significant 2.91-fold and 1.50-fold, respectively. When the researchers looked at the effects of sleep duration on the course of depression and anxiety separately, they found that both long and short sleep duration predicted a chronic course of anxiety symptoms, with significant odds ratios of 7.73 and 1.62, respectively. The same was true for chronic depressive symptoms, with corresponding odds of 4.34 and 2.03. Long and short sleep duration also predicted persistent depressive disorder, at significant odds ratios of 2.52 and 1.49, respectively, but neither predicted persistent anxiety disorder. Our study adds significant information on the impact of sleep disturbances on the course of psychopathology, say lead researcher Josine van Mill (EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research, Amsterdam, the Netherlands)and colleagues. In clinical practice, routinely asking for sleep duration might identify subjects at risk for a chronic course. Free abstract 
 Sleep Therapy Seen as an Aid for Depression By BENEDICT CAREY, New York Times November 18, 2013 Curing insomnia in people with depression could double their chance of a full recovery, scientists are reporting. The findings, based on an insomnia treatment that uses talk therapy rather than drugs, are the first to emerge from a series of closely watched studies of sleep and depression to be released in the coming year. The new report affirms the results of a smaller pilot study, giving scientists confidence that the effects of the insomnia treatment are real. If the figures continue to hold up, the advance will be the most significant in the treatment of depression since the introduction of Prozac in 1987. Depression is the most common mental disorder, affecting some 18 million Americans in any given year, according to government figures, and more than half of them also have insomnia. Experts familiar with the new report said that the results were plausible and that if supported by other studies, they should lead to major changes in treatment. It would be an absolute boon to the field, said Dr. Nada L. Stotland, professor of psychiatry at Rush Medical College in Chicago, who was not connected with the latest research. It makes good common sense clinically, she continued. If you have a depression, youre often awake all night, its extremely lonely, its dark, youre aware every moment that the world around you is sleeping, every concern you have is magnified. The study is the first of four on sleep and depression nearing completion, all financed by the National Institute of Mental Health. They are evaluating a type of talk therapy for insomnia that is cheap, relatively brief and usually effective, but not currently a part of standard treatment. The new report, from a team at Ryerson University in Toronto, found that 87 percent of patients who resolved their insomnia in four biweekly talk therapy sessions also saw their depression symptoms dissolve after eight weeks of treatment, either with an antidepressant drug or a placebo pill  almost twice the rate of those who could not shake their insomnia. Those numbers are in line with a previous pilot study of insomnia treatment at Stanford. In an interview, the reports lead author, Colleen E. Carney, said, The way this story is unfolding, I think we need to start augmenting standard depression treatment with therapy focused on insomnia. Dr. Carney acknowledged that the study was small  just 66 patients  and said a clearer picture should emerge as the other teams of scientists released their results. Those studies are being done at Stanford, Duke and the University of Pittsburgh and include about 70 subjects each. Dr. Carney will present her data on Saturday at a convention of the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies, in Nashville. Doctors have known for years that sleep problems are intertwined with mood disorders. But only recently have they begun to investigate the effects of treating both at the same time. Antidepressant drugs like Prozac help many people, as does talk therapy, but in rigorous studies the treatments, administered individually, only slightly outperform placebo pills. Used together the treatments produce a cure rate  full recovery  for about 40 percent of patients. Adding insomnia therapy, however, to an antidepressant would sharply lift the cure rate, Dr. Carneys data suggests, as do the findings from the Stanford pilot study, which included 30 people. Doctors have long considered poor sleep to be a symptom of depression that would clear up with treatments, said Rachel Manber, a professor in the psychiatry and behavioral sciences department at Stanford, whose 2008 pilot trial of insomnia therapy provided the rationale for larger studies. But we now know thats not the case, she said. The relationship is bidirectional  that insomnia can precede the depression. Full-blown insomnia is more serious than the sleep problems most people occasionally have. To qualify for a diagnosis, people must have endured at least a month of chronic sleep loss that has caused problems at work, at home or in important relationships. Several studies now suggest that developing insomnia doubles a persons risk of later becoming depressed  the sleep problem preceding the mood disorder, rather than the other way around. The therapy that Dr. Manber, Dr. Carney and the other researchers are using is called cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia, or CBT-I for short. The therapist teaches people to establish a regular wake-up time and stick to it; get out of bed during waking periods; avoid eating, reading, watching TV or similar activities in bed; and eliminate daytime napping. The aim is to reserve time in bed for only sleeping and  at least as important  to curb this idea that sleeping requires effort, that its something you have to fix, Dr. Carney said. Thats when people get in trouble, when they begin to think they have to do something to get to sleep. This kind of therapy is distinct from what is commonly known as sleep hygiene: exercising regularly, but not too close to bedtime, and avoiding coffee and too much alcohol in the evening. These healthful habits do not amount to an effective treatment for insomnia. In her 2008 pilot study testing CBT-I in people with depression, Dr. Manber of Stanford used sleep hygiene as part of her control treatment. She found that 60 percent of patients who received seven sessions of the talk therapy and an antidepressant fully recovered from their depression, compared with 33 percent who got the same drug and the sleep hygiene therapy. In the four larger trials expected to be published in 2014, researchers had participants keep sleep journals to track the effect of the CBT-I therapy, writing down what time they went to bed every night, what time they tried to fall asleep, how long it took, how many awakenings they had and what time they woke up. When the diaries show consistent, seldom-interrupted, good-quality slumber, the therapist conducts an interview to determine if there are any lingering issues. If there are none, the person has recovered. The therapy results in sharp reductions in nighttime wakefulness for most people who follow through. In interviews, several researchers noted that the National Institute of Mental Health had sharply curtailed funding for work in sleep treatment. Aleksandra Vicentic, the acting chief of the agencys behavioral and integrative neuroscience research branch, said that in 2009 the funding strategy changed for sleep projects. In an effort to illuminate the biology of sleeps impact on behavior, the agency is now focusing on how sleep affects the functioning of neural circuits. But Dr. Vicentic added that the agency continued to fund clinical work like the depression trials. Dr. Andrew Krystal, who is running the CBT-I study at Duke, called sleep this huge, still unexplored frontier of psychiatry. The body has complex circadian cycles, and mostly in psychiatry weve ignored them, he said. Our treatments are driven by convenience. We treat during the day and make little effort to find out whats happening at night. 
 Caffeine may harm sleep 6 hours before bedtime CBC News November 14, 2013 Taking caffeine even six hours before bedtime could reduce sleep by more than one hour, an effect that's underestimated by the general public and doctors, researchers say. While sleep experts recommend refraining from drinking coffee or consuming other food and drinks with caffeine close to bedtime, few studies have checked into the effects of taking caffeine in the late afternoon and early evening. A small study published in Friday's Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine tested the effects on sleep of 400 milligrams of caffeine  about 2-3 cups of coffee  taken at bedtime, three and six hours before lights out. "Even at six hours, caffeine reduced sleep by more than one hour," Christopher Drake of the Henry Ford Sleep Disorders and Research Center in Detroit and his co-authors concluded. Losing an hour of sleep over multiple nights may harm daytime function, the researchers said. "The present results suggest the common practice of afternoon consumption of caffeine should at a minimum be restricted to before 5.00 PM, particularly with regard to the moderate-large doses of caffeine commonly found in increasingly popular premium coffees and energy drinks." Commercially available 16-ounce servings of specialty coffee were found to contain up to 500 milligrams of caffeine in one study. Health Canada recommends no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day  about three 8 ounce cups (237 ml) of brewed coffee  with a lower limit for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant. Drake's team tested 12 healthy people with an average age of 39 who were asked to continue their normal sleep schedules of going to bed between 21:00 and 01:00 and waking between 0600 and 0900. The subjects were given three pills a day for four days and told to take one pill at six, three and zero hours before bedtime. There were 400 milligrams of caffeine in one of the pills and the other two were placebos. On one of the days, all three pills were placebos. There was also a washout night before each pill day. The subjects filled in sleep diaries and had their sleep disturbances measured objectively using an in-home sleep monitor that records EEG signals. The participants noticed their sleep was disturbed when they took caffeine pills at bedtime or three hours earlier but not six hours before. The researchers called the lack of perceived sleep disturbance an important finding that points to the need for more education. "The risks of caffeine use in terms of sleep disturbance are underestimated by both the general population and physicians," the study's authors said. Limitations of the study include the small number of subjects and lack of measuring caffeine levels in the blood. The study was funded by Zeo Inc. and several authors have financial interests or served as consultants to drug and sleep device manufacturers. 
 “Hidden Caves” in the Brain Open Up During Sleep to Wash Away Toxins by Jeremy Dean, PsyBlog November 11, 2013 “Hidden caves” that open up in the brain may help explain sleep’s amazing restorative powers. A new study published in the prestigious journal, Science, has found that the brain may wash away toxins built up over the day during sleep. The research discovered “hidden caves” inside the brain, which open up during sleep, allowing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to flush out potential neurotoxins, like β-amyloid, which has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease. To reach their discovery, researchers injected mice’s brains with a dye and monitored the flow while they were awake, asleep and anaesthetised (Xie et al., 2013). One of the study’s authors, Dr Maiken Nedergaard, explained the results: “We were surprised by how little flow there was into the brain when the mice were awake. It suggested that the space between brain cells changed greatly between conscious and unconscious states.” For a long time the real physiological purpose of sleep has remained a mystery. We know that lack of sleep causes all kinds of psychological problems like poor learning, decision-making and so on. We also know that animals that are chronically deprived of sleep will eventually die: flies or rodents in days to weeks, humans within months or years. Everyone who has ever enjoyed a blissfully good night’s sleep knows just how restorative it can be, but the actual physiological process wasn’t clear. This study, though, suggests that the flushing out of toxins by the CSF may be central to sleep’s wondrous powers. The interstitial spaces in the mouse’s brain took up only 14% of the brain’s volume while it was awake. Yet, while it slept, this increased by almost two-thirds to take up fully 23% of the brain’s total volume. The difference might seem slight, but the actual physiological effects are profound. During the day, the CSF mostly covers the surface of the brain. During sleep, though, the CSF is able to move deep inside. The effect is that potential neurotoxins, like β-amyloid, are cleared twice as fast during sleep as during waking. The results of this study–if they hold in humans–may help to explain why many neurological diseases, like strokes and dementia, are associated with problems sleeping. It could be that lack of sleep, and restriction of the brain’s cleaning system, may cause toxic metabolites to building up, leading to long-term damage. Jeremy Dean is a psychologist and the author of PsyBlog. His latest book is Making Habits, Breaking Habits: How to Make Changes That Stick. 
 Daylight Saving Time fall back doesnt equal sleep gain by Anthony Komaroff, M.D., Harvard Health November 2, 2013 Daylight Saving Time officially ends at 2:00 am this Sunday. In theory, falling back means an extra hour of sleep this weekend. Winston Churchill once described Daylight Saving Time like this: An extra yawn one morning in the springtime, an extra snooze one night in the autumn We borrow an hour one night in April; we pay it back with golden interest five months later. Thats an overly optimistic view. In reality, many people dont, or cant, take advantage of this weekends extra hour of sleep. And the resulting shift in the bodys daily sleep-wake cycle can disrupt sleep for several days. Research teams around the world have tried to determine if losing or gaining an hour of sleep because of Daylight Saving Time make a difference in health. This spring, Michigan researchers, writing in the American Journal of Cardiology, showed a small increase in heart attacks on the first day (Sunday) of the spring transition to Daylight Saving Time, when we lose an hour of sleep. This echoed a Swedish study published in the New England Journal of Medicineshowing a small increase in heart attacks after the start of Daylight Saving Time and a small decrease at its end. Other researchers have looked at driving accidents, workplace safety, and even school performance, with mixed results. Daylight Saving Time and sleep The focus on gaining or losing an hour of sleep overlooks the bigger picturethe effect of Daylight Saving Time transitions on the sleep cycle. An excellent review in the journal Sleep Medicine Reviews by Dr. Yvonne Harrison, a senior lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University in England, concludes that a seemingly small one-hour shift in the sleep cycle can affect sleep for up to a week. In the Fall, only a minority of people actually get that promised extra hour of sleep. During the following week, many people wake up earlier, have more trouble falling asleep, and are more likely to wake up during the night. People who tend to be so-called short sleepers, logging under 7.5 hours a night, and early risers (also known as larks), have the most trouble adjusting to the new schedule. Similar problems are seen in the Spring. Again, the adjustment is harder for larks and short sleepers. Springing back Each of us experiences predictable physical, mental, and behavioral changes during the course of a day. These are called circadian rhythms. The daily cycle of light and dark keep them on a 24-hour cycle. Sleep is a component of circadian rhythms. It is affected by outside influences, like light or Daylight Saving time. It can also affect the bodys other rhythms. Its difficult to side-step the effects of Daylight Saving time on sleep. My advice is to be aware that it can take your circadian and sleep rhythms a week or so to get adjusted to the new clock. Regular exercise, preferably at the same time each day, may help get your sleep cycle back on track. Going to bed and getting up on a schedule can help. And giving in to brief afternoon nap or two during the week may be a pleasant and relaxing way to restore lost sleep.

 Sleep Can Reduce Anxiety in Worriers, Study Shows By Sara Battista, NAMI Communications Intern August 2013 New research published this June in the Journal of Neuroscience suggests that the lack of sleep commonly associated with anxiety disorders may actually exacerbate symptoms of worrying. Results from the study strongly support the theory that sleep loss triggers the excessive anticipatory brain activity associated with anxiety, indicating that maintaining a healthy sleep pattern can help alleviate symptoms of anxiousness. While past research has shown that people with anxiety disorders tend to show hyperactivity in two major emotional brain regions known as the amygdala and anterior insula cortex, researchers from the present study were the first to establish a pattern of causation by directly testing the impact of sleep deprivation on anticipatory brain responses preceding emotionally salient events. The study conducted at the University of California, Berkeley examined the brains of 18 healthy adults, once while sleep-deprived and again while well-rested. Researchers used fMRI scans to monitor brain activity while participants viewed a series of either neutral or disturbing images. Prior to viewing the images, participants were primed with visual cues intended to trigger anticipatory anxiety. The cues depicted a red minus sign to warn for unpleasant images, a yellow circle to warn for neutral images or an ambiguous white question mark intended to provoke feelings of more intense anticipation in viewers. The fMRI scans revealed that when participants were sleep deprived, they showed heightened activity in the emotional brain regions of the amygdala and insula cortex. Furthermore, for the participants who were already prone to experiencing anxiety, results were even more intensified as those with the highest levels of trait anxiety showed the greatest increase in anticipatory insula activity when sleep deprived. These scans demonstrate that sleep disruption may aggravate anxiousness due to the impact of sleep loss on anticipatory brain function. The results from this study are particularly useful for those living with anxiety disorders including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, as they are especially sensitive to the effects of sleep deprivation. As head researcher Matthew Walker said, These findings help us realize that those people who are anxious by nature are the same people who will suffer the greatest harm from sleep deprivation. Moreover, the findings have strong therapeutic implications, showing that sleep restoration may be beneficial in relieving symptoms of worrying for those living with anxiety disorders and highly anxious individuals alike. By restoring good quality sleep in people suffering from anxiety, we may be able to help ameliorate their excessive worry and disabling fearful expectations, Walker said. Since those living with anxiety disorders commonly experience co-occurring sleep abnormalities, researchers from this study strongly believe that sleep therapy is a practical treatment option. This discovery ultimately illustrates how important sleep is to our mental health, said Walker. It also emphasizes the intimate relationship between sleep and psychiatric disorders, both from a cause and a treatment perspective. In short, those who are either living with an anxiety disorder or simply prone to experiencing anxiety on a regular basis should maintain a healthy sleep pattern in order to help manage symptoms of worrying. 
 Camping Could Reset Your Internal Clock: The Answer to Sleep Woes Catherine Griffin Aug 03, 2013 Do you have trouble sleeping at night or waking up in the morning? A week of camping may be the answer to your sleep worries--really. Scientists have discovered that humans' internal biological clocks will tightly synchronize to a natural, midsummer light-dark cycle if given the chance. This, in turn, can help you fall asleep more quickly and wake up with the sun. In order to examine sleep cycles, the scientists studied the internal circadian timing of eight adults after one week of routine work, school, social activities and self-selected sleeping schedules. They had normal exposures to electrical lighting during the time. Afterward, the scientists took the participants to Colorado for a camping trip. They were not allowed flashlights or cell phones and were instead only given the options of sunlight or campfires as a light source. However, they were allowed to keep any sleep schedule that they chose. The researchers then measured the levels of melatonin in the participants, a hormone associated with sleep. It turns out that a typical, modern environment causes about a two-hour delay in the circadian clock. People stayed up after midnight and woke up around 8:00 in the morning. But after about a week of natural lighting, all measures of circadian timing shifted two hours back and sleep schedules followed. The total amount of time spent sleeping, though, remained about the same. "By increasing our exposure to sunlight and reducing our exposure to electrical lighting at night, we can turn our internal clock and sleep times back and likely make it easier to awaken and be alert in the morning," said Kenneth Wright of the University of Chicago Boulder in a news release. The findings seem to explain an observed paradox in brain arousal. In our modern world, melatonin levels decrease to daytime levels about two hours after we wake up. In other words, our biological night extends past our wake time, which explains why so many of us are sleepy soon after we wake up. With exposure to natural light, the decrease in melatonin shifts to the last hour of sleep time, which helps people feel more alert in the morning. "Our findings suggest that people can have earlier bed and wake times, more conducive to their school and work schedules, if they were to increase their exposure to sunlight during the day and decrease their exposure to electrical lighting," said Wright. Obviously, not everyone can go camping for a week. There are ways to increase exposure to natural light, though. Go for a morning walk, keep your shades open at work and step outside during lunch. There's also the option of keeping the lights down low and turning off computers and TVS in the evening. It may not be ideal, but you'll probably appreciate the good night's sleep. The findings are published in the journal Current Biology. 
 Steps for More, and Better, Sleep By JANE E. BRODY, New York Times June 24, 2013 I regret that for most of my adult life, I treated sleep as more a luxury than a necessity. There was always something more to do before I crawled under the covers and turned out the light. I realize belatedly that I might have been more productive  and a lot nicer to live with if I had given sleep its proper due. By failing to acknowledge chronic sleep deprivation, I dozed during countless cultural events, and on two occasions I fell asleep while driving, barely escaping disaster. I have since reordered my priorities and learned to avoid distractions and activities that can keep me from getting the sleep my body and mind really need. About 70 million Americans sleep poorly or not nearly long enough to achieve the full physical, emotional and cognitive benefits sleep can bestow. There are myriad reasons, ranging from self-inflicted disruptions to those that are seemingly unavoidable. But there are also potential solutions to most of the factors that can interfere with sleep. For the sake of your health and longevity, I urge you to give them a try. How much sleep do you need? Sleep requirements depend on age. Newborns sleep 16 to 18 hours a day, preschoolers need 11 to 12 hours, and elementary school children need 10 hours. Adolescents should get 9 to 10 hours, though most teenagers sleep only about seven hours. Given the opportunity to sleep as long as they want, most adults average about eight hours a night. There are individual differences, of course, but the usual range is between seven and nine hours. Getting less than the amount of sleep you need during the school or workweek builds up a sleep debt that cannot be fully erased by sleeping in on the weekend. This pattern can also mess up your biological clock, making it hard to get up on Monday morning. It was long ago shown that a mid-afternoon nap of about 20 minutes can improve alertness and productivity and reduce mistakes among sleep-deprived workers, yet few employers offer a midday lie-down or provide a place for one. Age also affects the quality of sleep and the amount of time spent in the various stages of sleep. These include REM, or rapid-eye-movement sleep (often called dream sleep), and three types of non-REM sleep: the light sleep of Stage 1, followed by the more relaxed sleep of Stage 2 and the most restorative deep sleep of Stage 3. Young children spend most of the night in deep sleep, which is why they can often sleep through loud noise, bright light and being carried from car to bed. But with age, the time spent in deep sleep diminishes and any number of disturbances can cause awakenings. For women going through menopause, for example, sleep is often interrupted by hot flashes. Even if there are no external disturbances, elderly people may be awakened many times during the night by the discomforts of illness or pain, the side effects of medication or the need to urinate. Poor sleep among the elderly may in part account for problems with memory and concentration, depressed mood and daytime sleepiness. I often see gray heads nodding off at events, even during matinees. If noise or light disturbs your sleep, you can counter them with a white-noise machine and light-blocking shades. Keep the room cool and avoid weighty covers. Two years ago, I summarized factors that commonly interfere with a good nights sleep, but a quick review, followed by some valuable new tips that have helped me, may help you too. EXERCISE Physical activity leaves you tired, but if you do your workout within two or three hours of bedtime, you may be too revved up to fall asleep easily. MEDICATION Many drugs, both prescription and over-the-counter, contain stimulating chemicals like pseudoephedrine and caffeine, commonly found in decongestants and painkillers. Beta-blockers, used to treat certain heart conditions and high blood pressure, may be disruptive as well. Ask your doctor if you can use an alternative drug. FOOD AND DRINK Eating a big meal close to bedtime can be a problem, especially if you are prone to indigestion. Drinking a caffeinated beverage late in the day can disturb the sleep of anyone who has not developed a tolerance to caffeine by drinking too much of it. Caffeines stimulating effects can last for six to eight hours and make it hard to fall asleep or cause middle-of-the-night wakefulness. Alcohol may help you fall asleep, but when its effects wear off hours later, you may wake up and be unable to get back to sleep. (I and others I know find wine especially problematic and avoid drinking it with dinner.) STRESS Anxiety, excessive stress and difficulty shutting out worries trigger the release of body chemicals that act as stimulants. Try a relaxing bedtime ritual like a hot bath, meditation or progressive muscle relaxation, starting at the toes and working up to your head. Or, odd though it may seem, try reading something dull. If things you must remember or do the next day keep popping into your head, put a pad and pen next to the bed, write them down and then do your best to forget about them until morning. OTHER TIPS Years ago I mentioned that leg cramps were waking me up well before the alarm, and readers responded with myriad solutions, from bedtime stretches to magnesium supplements. What has worked best: drinking about eight ounces of tonic water (diet version) every day. Tonic water contains modest amounts of quinine, which used to be sold over-the-counter to reduce leg cramps. Another innocuous sleep aid that has proved miraculous for me is a nightly supplement of melatonin, which the body naturally produces after dark. The pineal gland in the brain is inactive during the day, but after sundown it starts spewing melatonin into the bloodstream. With a supplement on board, I fall asleep quickly, and if I awaken during the night, I return to sleep easily. A three-milligram supplement near bedtime is considered harmless and may help you as well, though it should not be given to children without consulting a doctor. If hot flashes are your current problem, ask your doctor about trying the prescription drug gabapentin. 
 Cheating Ourselves of Sleep By JANE E. BRODY, NYTimes.com June 17, 2012 Think you do just fine on five or six hours of shut-eye? Chances are, you are among the many millions who unwittingly shortchange themselves on sleep. Research shows that most people require seven or eight hours of sleep to function optimally. Failing to get enough sleep night after night can compromise your health and may even shorten your life. From infancy to old age, the effects of inadequate sleep can profoundly affect memory, learning, creativity, productivity and emotional stability, as well as your physical health. According to sleep specialists at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, among others, a number of bodily systems are negatively affected by inadequate sleep: the heart, lungs and kidneys; appetite, metabolism and weight control; immune function and disease resistance; sensitivity to pain; reaction time; mood; and brain function. Poor sleep is also a risk factor for depression and substance abuse, especially among people with post-traumatic stress disorder, according to Anne Germain, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. People with PTSD tend to relive their trauma when they try to sleep, which keeps their brains in a heightened state of alertness. Dr. Germain is studying what happens in the brains of sleeping veterans with PTSD in hopes of developing more effective treatments for them and for people with lesser degrees of stress that interfere with a good night’s sleep. The elderly are especially vulnerable. Timothy H. Monk, who directs the Human Chronobiology Research Program at Western Psychiatric, heads a five-year federally funded study of circadian rhythms, sleep strength, stress reactivity, brain function and genetics among the elderly. “The circadian signal isn’t as strong as people get older,” he said. He is finding that many are helped by standard behavioral treatments for insomnia, like maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding late-in-day naps and caffeine, and reducing distractions from light, noise and pets. It should come as no surprise that myriad bodily systems can be harmed by chronically shortened nights. “Sleep affects almost every tissue in our bodies,” said Dr. Michael J. Twery, a sleep specialist at the National Institutes of Health. Several studies have linked insufficient sleep to weight gain. Not only do night owls with shortchanged sleep have more time to eat, drink and snack, but levels of the hormone leptin, which tells the brain enough food has been consumed, are lower in the sleep-deprived while levels of ghrelin, which stimulates appetite, are higher. In addition, metabolism slows when one’s circadian rhythm and sleep are disrupted; if not counteracted by increased exercise or reduced caloric intake, this slowdown could add up to 10 extra pounds in a year. The body’s ability to process glucose is also adversely affected, which may ultimately result in Type 2 diabetes. In one study, healthy young men prevented from sleeping more than four hours a night for six nights in a row ended up with insulin and blood sugar levels like those of people deemed prediabetic. The risks of cardiovascular diseases and stroke are higher in people who sleep less than six hours a night. Even a single night of inadequate sleep can cause daylong elevations in blood pressure in people with hypertension. Inadequate sleep is also associated with calcification of coronary arteries and raised levels of inflammatory factors linked to heart disease. (In terms of cardiovascular disease, sleeping too much may also be risky. Higher rates of heart disease have been found among women who sleep more than nine hours nightly.) The risk of cancer may also be elevated in people who fail to get enough sleep. A Japanese study of nearly 24,000 women ages 40 to 79 found that those who slept less than six hours a night were more likely to develop breast cancer than women who slept longer. The increased risk may result from diminished secretion of the sleep hormone melatonin. Among participants in the Nurses Health Study, Eva S. Schernhammer of Harvard Medical School found a link between low melatonin levels and an increased risk of breast cancer. A study of 1,240 people by researchers at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland found an increased risk of potentially cancerous colorectal polyps in those who slept fewer than six hours nightly. Children can also experience hormonal disruptions from inadequate sleep. Growth hormone is released during deep sleep; it not only stimulates growth in children, but also boosts muscle mass and repairs damaged cells and tissues in both children and adults. Dr. Vatsal G. Thakkar, a psychiatrist affiliated with New York University, recently described evidence associating inadequate sleep with an erroneous diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children. In one study, 28 percent of children with sleep problems had symptoms of the disorder, but not the disorder. During sleep, the body produces cytokines, cellular hormones that help fight infections. Thus, short sleepers may be more susceptible to everyday infections like colds and flu. In a study of 153 healthy men and women, Sheldon Cohen and colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University found that those who slept less than seven hours a night were three times as likely to develop cold symptoms when exposed to a cold-causing virus than were people who slept eight or more hours. Some of the most insidious effects of too little sleep involve mental processes like learning, memory, judgment and problem-solving. During sleep, new learning and memory pathways become encoded in the brain, and adequate sleep is necessary for those pathways to work optimally. People who are well rested are better able to learn a task and more likely to remember what they learned. The cognitive decline that so often accompanies aging may in part result from chronically poor sleep. With insufficient sleep, thinking slows, it is harder to focus and pay attention, and people are more likely to make poor decisions and take undue risks. As you might guess, these effects can be disastrous when operating a motor vehicle or dangerous machine. In driving tests, sleep-deprived people perform as if drunk, and no amount of caffeine or cold air can negate the ill effects. At your next health checkup, tell your doctor how long and how well you sleep. Be honest: Sleep duration and quality can be as important to your health as your blood pressure and cholesterol level. This is the first of two columns on inadequate sleep. 
 New Study Finds Duration in Sleep Decreases Suicide Risk By Therese Borchard May 29, 2013 A new study published in an online supplement of the medical journal Sleep found that for every one-hour increase in sleep duration there was a 72 percent decrease in the likelihood of suicide risk in people with insomnia. Says primary author Linda Oliver, MA, clinical research coordinator for the University of Pennsylvania Behavioral Sleep Medicine Research Program in Philadelphia, “We were surprised by the strength of the association between sleep duration and suicide risk.” I’m not at all surprised by those findings. If I had to name the component primarily responsible for landing me in a psych ward a few years ago, it was the sleep deprivation that followed the birth of my son. I’ve always regarded sleep (and I reiterate this point in my video) as the cornerstone of mental health, and I always advise folks who are depressed to practice some sleep hygiene before they try on too many diagnoses. Insomnia is more common than you think. Approximately 30 to 40 percent of adults report some symptoms of insomnia within a given year, and 10 to 15 percent report chronic insomnia, according to the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research. The relationship between insomnia and mood disorders is complex because insomnia undoubtedly aggravates depression and anxiety, and vice versa. However, in some cases chronic insomnia can actually cause the mood disorder and is a major factor in the recurrence of depression and anxiety. David N. Neubauer, M.D., M.A., associate director of the Johns Hopkins Sleep Disorders Center, and author of Understanding Sleeplessness: Perspectives on Insomnia, was interviewed for a Johns Hopkins Bulletin. He explains the chicken-egg question of mood disorders and insomnia: When surveying people who are depressed, we find that 80 percent experience sleeplessness, and it’s not only the classic early-morning awakening associated with depression, but rather all the possibilities, including difficulty falling asleep and middle-of-the-night awakenings. There is also the issue of severity: The more depressed someone is, the more likely it is that he or she will have sleep problems. The converse is true, too. If a person suffers from insomnia, over time it creates a risk for developing a mood disorder such as major depression. There are several excellent observational studies that demonstrate the link between insomnia and the future risk of developing a mood disorder. The link is evident as quickly as one year after an episode of insomnia, and can last as long as decades. In other words, chronic sleep deprivation may not only worsen mood disorders but also can interfere with effective treatment and increase the risk of recurrence. 
 I battled insomnia for years and worked really, really hard to get off sleeping pills. I don't want to go back on them. I now work a job though that finishes most days at 3am and I work from home so I can be in bed by 3:05. Sounds pretty ideal except my mind then races for hours and I can't stop it and I obviously can't sleep. At that point, when and if I can get it to slow down, the sun is coming up and my body is now trying to follow a natural cycle which I worked so hard to teach it to do. How do I stop my mind from racing at bed time so I can maybe fall asleep right away? I am exhausted and just want quality sleep again. 
 Sleep deprivation plays havoc with genes Australian Broadcasting Corporation Feb 26, 2013 Sleep deprivation affects hundreds of genes involved with inflammation, immunity and cells' response to stress, British researchers have found. The findings might help explain why some people who do not get enough sleep have an increased risk for obesity, heart disease and cognitive impairment. Sleep expert Derk-Jan Dijk and colleagues from the University of Surrey took whole-blood RNA samples from 26 participants after they had spent a week sleeping 8.5 hours a night, and the same participants after a week of sleeping for just 5.7 hours. The expression of genes in blood offers a view into what is happening in other organs of the body, including the brain and liver, which are more difficult to test repeatedly, the authors note. After each week, 10 blood samples were taken from each participant at three-hourly intervals, during a period of total sleep deprivation that helped the researchers control the effects of light, activity and food on gene expression. The experimental conditions mimic what many people experience on a regular basis, the researchers note in their article. Circadian rhythms affected "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 30 per cent of civilian adults in the United States report an average sleep duration of six hours or less." Comparing the two sets of samples, the researchers found that 444 genes were down-regulated after the sleepless week, and 267 were up-regulated. Their study appears in the latest issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Genes related to circadian rhythms, metabolism, inflammation, immune response and stress were all affected by the experiment. "The identified biological processes may be involved with the negative effects of sleep loss on health," the researchers say. Window to biological mechanisms The results "contribute to the developing evidence that poor or insufficient sleep is a health risk," comments Australian sleep researcher John Trinder from the University of Melbourne. The new findings also open a window into the mechanisms that underpin the harmful effects of sleep deprivation, notes sleep researcher Andrew Vakulin from the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research in Sydney. "It's a snapshot of what's going on," he tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. "It's summarizing what's getting turned off and on and gives us the ability to look at things much more closely now." The new study also offers scientists avenues for studying why different individuals are more susceptible to the consequences of sleep deprivation, says Vakulin. 
 Faulty Sleep Mechanism Might Cause Trauma to Linger By Stephani Sutherland, Scientific American MIND April 8, 2013 Traumatic memories persist when our nighttime memory-erasing process fails Scientists have long known that once we nod off, certain memories grow stronger. One recent theory suggests that forgetting, too, is an essential function of sleep [see Sleep's Secret Repairs by Jason Castro, Scientific American Mind, May/June 2012]. Researchers now suspect that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may emerge from flaws in sleep's forgetting process. Two studies presented at the 2012 meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in New Orleans indicate that sleep might offer a window of opportunity for weakening memories and providing relief from lingering reminders of trauma. Neuroscientists believe that during sleep, a memory-elimination routine cleans out obsolete information by physically weakening synapses, the junctions between communicating neurons. Gina Poe, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, found in mice that for synapses to lose strength, levels of the neurotransmitter noradrenaline must drop. Noradrenaline levels typically fall during REM sleep in rodents and humans, but in people with PTSD the amount stays high throughout sleep. Normalizing noradrenaline with pharmaceuticals, Poe says, could absolutely be a key target to actually cure PTSD through normal sleep. In a separate experiment, researcher Asya Rolls of Stanford University hijacked memory remodeling in sleeping mice to make a traumatic association less scary. Rolls and her colleagues conditioned mice to fear the scent of jasmine flowers by pairing the smell with a foot shock. When the mice slept, they released a puff of jasmine. Under normal circumstances, the smell would reactivate and bolster the memory, a process that requires newly made structural proteins. The researchers gave some mice a drug that prevented the manufacture of these building blocks in a key fear-memory area. When these mice woke up, they no longer responded to the odor with fearful behavior, indicating that the memory had been successfully disrupted. The findings might someday translate to a new kind of sleep-based therapy in people whose traumatic experiences are tied to specific sounds and smellssuch as the noise of a bomb going offthat can be presented to their sleeping brain. Current treatments for PTSDand other persistent negative memoriesoften rely on exposure therapy, which inoculates patients against their fear trigger by creating a new, safe memory that springs to mind more often than the old, frightening memory. But the old memory remains. To truly diminish its power, this research suggests, we must target the unconscious mind and help the brain forget. This article was originally published with the title Desperate to Forget. 
 As You Spring Forward, Avoid a Sleep Setback InteliHealth (The Orange County Register, Calif.) March 8, 2013 It might take you a couple days to adjust to daylight saving time on Sunday, when at 2 a.m., time will "spring ahead" to 3 a.m., but you will indeed get used to that hour of light being swiped from the morning and transported to the evening. If you have difficulty sleeping the rest of the year too, there are ways you can help yourself. The most important one might be: Take a walk. A poll released this week by the National Sleep Foundation found that people who exercise, even a little, enjoyed more restful sleep than people who got no exercise at all. "I don't think we can say, on the basis of this poll, that exercise improves sleep, but people who exercise regularly are less likely to report sleep disturbance," said Dr. Barbara Phillips, the medical director of the sleep lab at the University of Kentucky's College of Medicine. She also helped put together questions for the poll, taken of 1,000 adults ages 23 to 60. The most active people reported the fewest problems: Among the respondents who described themselves as vigorous exercisers, 83 percent said their sleep quality had been "very good" or "fairly good" in the previous two weeks. But there wasn't much drop-off for those who exercised less: 77 percent of moderate exercises had very or fairly good sleep, and 76 percent of light exercisers said that. In the group that engaged in no physical activity, only 56 percent said they got enough sleep. The time of day the exercise took place didn't seem to matter. Many experts have long urged people to avoid working out right before bed, arguing that sleep comes more quickly when the body is cooled down and not over-stimulated. Among the respondents who exercised within four hours of bedtime, 55 percent said their sleep improved on exercise days; among those who exercised further away from bedtime, 54 percent said their sleep was better on those days. The Sleep Foundation has now amended its guidelines to encourage sleepers to exercise, regardless of the hour, as long as it doesn't come at the expense of sleep. "If you're a typical American and you have a day job, that only leaves so much time for exercise," Phillips said. "We shouldn't give people an excuse to not exercise. What we're saying now, loud and clear, is that unless your doctor tells you otherwise, exercise anywhere, anytime you can if you want to improve your sleep." The poll also makes a strong connection between a lack of exercise and obstructive sleep apnea, a serious disorder in which the airway is blocked, often by the tongue or other soft tissue inside the mouth or throat. This causes the sleeper to wake up during the night, sometimes dozens of times an hour, and the result can be anything from sleepiness during the day to an increased risk of diabetes, depression and heart attacks. Being overweight vastly increases the odds of developing sleep apnea, since fatty tissue reduces the airway space. Men with a neck size of 17, and women of 16, are at greater risk of apnea. The poll said that 44 percent of nonexercisers had a moderate risk of sleep apnea, compared with a 26 percent risk for light exercisers. Sleepers whose problems persist, and especially those who snore at night, should get checked out by a sleep specialist. These dangers don't mean that we should disregard the temporary disruptions that come with the arrival of daylight saving time. Weird things happen in the hours after we set our clocks forward, which we should do Saturday night (it officially takes effect at 2 a.m. Sunday local time). Sleep-deprived drivers, especially Monday morning, are a real problem: A 1996 study showed that the vehicle-accident rate on that first workday went up 8 percent, compared with one week later. And last year, a University of Alabama at Birmingham study showed that the time change was associated with a 10 percent increase in heart attacks on the following Monday and Tuesday. It's only an hour. Anyone flying from John Wayne to Denver would notice the same result, a mini-jet lag. "People do that every day and we don't make too much of it," Phillips said. "But on Saturday night, we'll all do it at once. Because everybody suffers a small problem, cumulatively it can add up to a big problem." Most people recover from the switch in a day or two. To make the transition smoother, consider these tips: Go to sleep a little earlier Saturday. If you really want to prepare, make the bedtime earlier a little bit each night leading up to the switch. Get plenty of sunlight in the morning, as early as you can. Avoid bright lights in the evening, including the use of electronic gadgets that emit LED light. Even if you're tired, don't take a nap. 
 College Students and Sleep by Dr. Marks Feb 27, 2013 College is a time of freedom, exploration and learning to become an independent adult. For those who attend college away from home, you are now master of your own decisions. You get to decide what you are going to do and when Most students soon realize that the academic rigor of college is exponentially greater than high school. There is so much to learn and too little time. So how do you to accommodate all of your new responsibilities? Naturally you sleep less. When you have competing demands like two projects due on one day and multiple quizzes later in the week, perhaps the easiest approach is to focus on one assignment at a time and give that effort 200%. Unfortunately that 200% often means late night studying and pulling all-nighters. This leads to college students as a whole being extremely sleep deprived. For some, college can be a time of practicing some of the unhealthiest habits that you will experience in your lifetime. When it comes to the all-nighter, what seems to make sense for cramming in high volumes of information, actually works the opposite in helping your remember your information. The ability to remember new information, also known as memory consolidation, occurs during sleep. Think of your daytime class attendance as gathering goods that you then dump off at a warehouse at the end of the day. Then when you sleep, the night crew comes in and sorts all of the boxes and data you provided. When you wake in the morning, you have all of your information neatly filed away and organized by the night crew. This organization is critical for you to be able to retrieve information when you need it When you decrease the amount of time you sleep, you don’t leave enough time for the night crew (the brain) to file away the information. You then wake only being able to retrieve the data that was processed and the other is still sitting in boxes on the warehouse floor. Add alcohol to the mix and you really shut down the factory. Since alcohol breaks up your sleep and decreases slow wave sleep, this would be equivalent to the warehouse workers taking too many smoke breaks instead of working. They may be present in the factory and clocking the time, but they are not efficient in their work to file away your data. So the take away message is sleep is essential for consolidating memories and helping you ace your tests. You also need sleep for better analytic skills in writing papers. Don’t fall into the trap of believing that you are benefiting from pulling all-nighters to finish your work. This article was orginally written for The Bedtime Network. 
 I had a very disturbing dream not too long ago that I was in an auditorium (like a school gym with a stage in it for assemblies) and was in the front row of folding chairs. We were at a rehearsal of some kind. {graphic description of violent acts deleted} The worst dream was that I was in the home we grew up in. I walked into the kitchen and saw {graphic description of violent acts deleted} ??? Now....my brother and I are not on speaking terms but he's never been violent. Just a loudmouth drunk. Hi, Maybe you can help. I've had terrible dreams before {reference to specific violence deleted}, but these two dreams are the ones that have scared me the most in my entire life. They just happened....one last week and one this week. Last week, I don't really know what I was dreaming but I felt someone grab my toes like they were grabbing them hard to pull me off the end of the bed. I woke up, scared to death - and I was yelling out in my sleep. I fell back to sleep a little while later and it happened again. I could actually feel someone grabbing my feet and again, I woke up screaming. I curled up in a fetal position in bed for the rest of the night waiting for the light to come out. I have to add....I'm a 48 year old female. The one this week.....all I remember was someone pulling my arm and trying to pull me off the bed. Again, I woke myself up screaming "Let Go of Me" and "Go Away" I fell back to sleep pretty quickly and within 15 minutes it happened again. And again, I was yelling but actually screaming this time. The weird thing is with both of these dreams is that I have my cats sleeping with me. Not one of them moved or acknowledged that I yelled out loud. One cat actually sleeps on top of my shoulder and she didn't even run when I yelled. I know I was yelling because thats how I woke myself up. What gives?? Adriane 
 I just scanned previous threads here, but there are a lot and so if I missed one that has already covered this topic, please let me know. My questions is this: Why do some people almost always remember their dreams very vividly (such as myself), while others almost never do? I have heard from various sources that everybody dreams, but most of the time we just don't remember. I always remember. I always have! As a child, I tried to figure out if there was a pattern in my dreams. I think I was going through a weeklong series of bad dreams, so I wanted to figure out what was triggering these dreams in order to try to prevent them. At that point, I recall coming to the conclusion that the major themes of my dreams tended to be topics that came up during my day EVER so briefly-- the things that I might think about for 5 seconds and then completely forget. The minute details. But that's not really my question-- I was just trying to explain how I have always remembered my dreams very vividly. But so many other people don't! Or if they do, it's only occasionally. For me, sometimes I feel like it's exhausting to dream like I do and remember them so well. The dreams stay with me throughout my day, and often feel like memories of actual events. Sometimes they are incredibly imaginative, and sometimes they'll be ridiculously monotonous. But it makes me feel like I'm not even sleeping because they are so vivid, I wake up feeling like I actually experienced whatever I had been dreaming about! I think I heard something about it relating to the amount of time that passes before you wake up after dreaming, or after the REM cycle... but it's a little confusing to me. Anybody have any insight on this subject? 
 Glad you are sleeping well Turtle! On that subject I've sometimes wondered whether I should try prescription sleeping pills, but I've always thought "why bother", since mine is a thoroughly long-term, kinda biologically self-sustaining problem, and I thought sleeping drugs were not for long-term use. Is this still always true, though? I really need to get around to a sleep study, somewhat of a 'new thing' where I live. 
 I suffer from 'night horrors' and 'night sweats' a lot and my neighbours have complained to me and the housing officer about me disturbing them by shouting out loud, in the early hours of the morning! This happens a lot, so sometimes im too scared to sleep in fear of more hassle!! Any ideas? 
 Treating Sleep Improves Psychiatric Symptoms By David Levine, Scientific American November 27, 2012 Sleep may be a critical linkand therapeutic targetin mental illness People with depression or other mental illnesses often report trouble sleeping, daytime drowsiness and other sleep-related issues. Now a growing body of research is showing that treating sleep problems can dramatically improve psychiatric symptoms in many patients. Much of the latest work illustrates how sleep apnea, a common chronic condition in which a person repeatedly stops breathing during sleep, may cause or aggravate psychiatric symptoms. In past years sleep apnea has been linked to depression in small studies and limited populations. Now a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strengthens that connection. The CDC analyzed the medical records of nearly 10,000 American adults with sleep apnea. Men diagnosed with this disorder had twice the risk of depressionand women five times the riskcompared with those without sleep apnea. Writing in the April issue of Sleep, lead author Anne G. Wheaton and her colleagues speculate that in addition to interrupting sleep, the oxygen deprivation induced by sleep apnea could harm cells and disrupt normal brain functioning. Treating this disorder shows promise for reducing symptoms of depression, a recent study at the Cleveland Clinic suggests. In the experiment, patients went to bed wearing a mask hooked up to a machine that increases air pressure in their throat. The increased pressure prevents the airway from collapsing, which is what causes breathing to cease in most cases of this disorder. Using this machine, psychiatrist Charles Bae and his colleagues treated 779 patients who had been diagnosed with sleep apnea. After an average of 90 days of sleeping with the machine, all the patients scored lower on a common depression survey than before the treatmentregardless of whether they had a prior diagnosis of depression or were taking an antidepressant. The data were presented in June at the SLEEP 2012 conference in Boston. Investigating their patients' sleep health might allow doctors to alleviate mental disturbances earlyperhaps even before patients try psychiatric drugs. This treatment could be especially important for children, according to three new studies that show sleep is associated with mental disturbance at young ages. An August study in Medical Hypotheses reported that about 25 to 50 percent of children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder experience sleep problems. A few months earlier in the journal Pediatrics, researchers found that of the 11,000 children in the study, those with disordered breathing in sleep (as reported by their parents) had 40 percent more behavioral difficulties at four years old and 60 percent more at age seven. Sleep disturbances affect moods, tooand not simply by producing crankiness. Adolescents who reported daytime drowsiness were also more likely to experience sadness, according to a March study in the Journal of Mental Health Policy and Economics. Steven Y. Park, assistant professor of otolaryngology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, has long been advocating that sleep disorders are an underlying cause of many psychiatric disorders. The way I see it, Park says, you can't consider a psychiatric disorder without thinking about a sleep-breathing problem. 
 The Science Behind Our Strange, Spooky Dreams By Wynne Parry, Scientific American November 12, 2012 The disturbing world of dreams is grounded in day-to-day experience, scientists say The realm of sleep and dreams has long been associated with strangeness: omens or symbols, unconscious impulses and fears. But this sometimes disturbing world of inner turmoil, fears and desires is grounded in our day-to-day experience, sleep researchers say. "The structure and content of thinking looks very much like the structure and content of dreaming. They may be the product of the same machine," said Matthew Wilson, a neuroscientist at MIT and a panelist at the New York Academy of Sciences discussion "The Strange Science of Sleep and Dreams" on Friday (Nov. 9). His work and others' explores the crucial link between dreams and learning and memory. Dreams allow the brain to work through its conscious experiences. During them, the brain appears to apply the same neurological machinery used during the day to examine the past, the future and other aspects of a person's (or animal's) inner world at night. Memory is the manifestation of this inner world, Wilson said. "What we remember is the result of dreams rather than the other way around," he said. Dreams as teachers His work, and that of fellow panelist Erin Wamsley, a sleep scientist at Beth Israel Medical Center/Harvard Medical School, focuses on the relationship between memory and dreams in non-REM sleep. Vivid dreams often occur during REM sleep, named for the rapid eye movement associated with it, however, non-REM sleep also brings dreams but they are more fragmentary. Wamsley's research indicates dreams help people learn. [7 Mind-Bending Facts About Dreams] In a study published in the journal Current Biology in April 2010, she and colleagues found that study subjects who entered non-REM sleep and dreamed about a video game maze they had played hours earlier saw their performance increase dramatically more than those who slept but did not report any maze-related dreams. Meanwhile, thinking about the maze while awake did not improve the players' performance. Although this work focused on non-REM sleep, incorporation of learning happens in all stages of sleep, Wamsley told the audience. Wamsley has also used another video game, this one of a downhill skiing, to probe the relationship between dreams and learning. Like the maze, this game was intended to be interactive and exciting for the subjects, Wamsley said. Subjects reported their dreams after playing, and initially, their dreams put them directly back into the game, as if rehearsing. But as they fell deeper into sleep, their dreams became more extractive with less literal relationship to the game, she said. For instance, one subject described following boot prints in the snow. This may be because in deeper sleep, the brain is trying to extract meaning from the experience earlier in the day. The subject's dream about boot prints may have been a way to refine the dreamer's concept of how to move through snow, she said. Learning the maze Like some of Wamsley's subjects, Wilson's also dreamed of mazes, but these mazes were real. By accident, Wilson found when rats fall asleep their brains replay parts of their experience in a maze. By using fine electrodes to eavesdrop on the activity of single neurons in the hippocampus, a region of the brain associated with spatial memory, he saw this happen. Individual neurons in rats' and humans' hippocampuses fire in response to spatial location, so each time a rat passes a certain point within the maze a single neuron fires. Once the rats fell asleep, Wilson found these neurons would fire as they were reactivated in patterns that represented brief segments of the maze, which could be run forward or in reverse, Wilson found. In the future, science may develop ways to control cognitive functions enhanced by sleep, "using sleep and dreams as a tool the way we use learning and teaching while we are conscious," he said. In one study, he and colleagues successfully manipulated the content of rats' dreams with a tone they had used earlier to direct the animals as they navigated a maze. The tone caused the rats to dream of the section of the maze they had been taught to associate with that tone. Going without No one can speak to the value of sleep more than someone deprived of it. Alan Berliner, a filmmaker who explored his own insomnia in his 2006 documentary Wide Awake offered that perspective to the discussion. [5 Fun Facts About Sleep] "Every night when I put my head on the pillow, it's like an adventure," Berliner says in a clip of the film played during the discussion. He described songs, particularly Leonard Cohen's In My Secret Life, looping in his head and his thoughts racing uncontrollably. "I started to think the expression human error means sleepiness," he said in the film. 
 You Needed Last Nights Dream: Research and Re-thinking by Suzanne Phillips, Psy.D., ABPP, PsychCentral October 22, 2012 Whereas there is increasing recognition of the importance of sleep, there is less awareness that one of the reasons we need to sleep is that we need to dream. Even though you may not remember them, you dream several times a night. In a typical lifetime, we spend about six years dreaming. Throughout time and across cultures man has ascribed importance to dreams. Recognized for his seminal contribution of The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud considered dreams as the royal road to the unconscious. According to him, dreams represented instinctual aggressive and sexual drives pressing for discharge. Disguised by the primary process of symbols, displacements and condensations, the dream was believed to represent hidden instinctual wish fulfillment. While dreamers still make important use of the metaphors and symbolic representations in their dreams, the royal road has been expanded and repaved. Evolving psychological theory and research from Brain Science reveal that well beyond wish fulfillment, we need and use dreams in the organization of data, the consolidation of memory, the integration of skills and the regulation of psychological functioning. Matt Wilson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology tells us  Dreaming is a process, and not only is it useful, it may be essential for making sense of the world. Important in understanding the function of dreams are the new findings on sleep cycles: Early dream studies had found that at those times when sleepers were deeply asleep with muscle tone at zero, they were exhibiting rapid eye movement (REM). When awakened, they reported dreaming. This was termed REM Sleep.We now understand that most people sleep in 90 minute cycles in which they descend from light sleep, stage 1, without rapid eye movements (non-REM) to deep non-REM sleep (stages 3 and 4, also known as slow-wave sleep), then begin a return journey; but dont quite make it. Just before waking, we enter REM sleep after which we repeat the cycle four or five times a night.Lab studies reveal that we have dreams in both phases of sleep and that non-REM dreams and REM dreams actually serve different functions. The Purpose of non-REM Dreams If you have ever skied for hours, studied for hours, or spent hours reaching a level on a video game, you may have dreamed of moguls, math equations or video images. These are non-REM dreams, which are generally associated with the consolidation of newly learned facts, skills and experiences. Harvard Neuroscientist Robert Stickgold suggests that it is as if the brain registers what you have been doing and then tries to figure out what to keep and what to dump.In a fascinating study, Stickgold and colleagues asked 99 college students to memorize a computer maze. They then put the students inside a virtual, 3-D version of the maze and asked them to navigate to another spot within it. After doing this, half the students had the opportunity to take a 90-minute nap while the other half stayed awake and watched videos.Five hours later when the students were given the maze test again, those that napped did better than the students who had stayed awake  even if those students had reviewed the maze in their head.Dramatically, those nappers who dreamed about the maze (one reported being lost in a bat cave) performed 10 times better than the nappers who did not dream!Of particular interest is the fact that the students who dreamed about the maze had done poorly on the test the first time around. After napping and dreaming  their score was 10 times better than other nappers who had outscored those who stayed awake.The researchers suggest that if a task is difficult for you- your brain seems to register that will more likely dream about it  which in turn improves integration and performance. For students, writers, scientists, artists and anyone who feels compelled to pull  all-nighters, it makes sense to work, find some time to sleep and perchance to dream. The Purpose of REM Dreams REM dreams are the dreams that lead us to say to ourselves or someone else  I cant believe the dream I had last night! REM dreams have a different quality than non-REM dreams. They are typically longer, more vivid, more animated, more emotionally charged. Often a bizarre mix of symbols, metaphor and action, they are less like waking life events than non-REM dreams.Underscoring this, dream researcher, Patrick McNamara, tells us that there are more emotions in REM dreams because the amygdala is very highly activated and the amygdala in our brain specializes in handling unpleasant emotions like intense fear, anger or aggression. Increased REM dreaming also appears to be associated with the ability to use fantasy effectively and to engage in divergent and creative thinking. As such, REM dreaming offers the dreamer an opportunity to understand and regulate emotion, adapt to stress, integrate trauma, access creative associations, as well as maintain and restore a sense of self personally and interpersonally. For example: A man, conflicted with the decision to leave his job, dreams that is trapped in the elevator at work  the doors wont open and he cant reach up to the cables to find a way up and out. If the dreamer takes note of his feeling in the dream, he may be communicating to himself a feeling that he is having about work that he has not yet articulated to himself. A man, whose wife was murdered in their home, had the repeated dream of seeing the body bag being carried out the front door between the two front hedges. Trauma dreams, while frightening and disturbing, reflect our attempt to integrate the images and feelings we registered in a fight/flight state at the time of the trauma. The dreamer above had never actually seen his house from the perspective of the dream, but the dream combined specific images that represented his unspeakable horror. With professional help, he found a way to use and move on from this dream. A timid women, enraged with the treatment by and attitude of her female boss, dreams that she tells the boss off and looks around to see friends and family smiling. As a quick rule for considering dreams, a dreamer benefits from asking three questions: How did I feel in this dream?What thoughts and associations do I have to people, places, symbols or setting in the dream?Does this dream have anything to do with my waking life? The dreamer above might feel elated that she finally expresses anger to her boss. (She may feel better the next day no matter what she does.) Her association to the family and friends may be a feeling of support that is different from and dilutes the treatment of her boss. She might even see in their smiles her own smile (Improved self-esteem). She might dare to consider the dream as a preview of a stronger self in her waking life. Whether we forget our dreams, write them down or seek help with them, we have a  night shift at work as we sleep. As life presents us with the good, the bad and the unresolved, it makes sense to not only  sleep on it, but to  dream on it. 
 Teen with 'Sleeping Beauty' syndrome sleeps for days CBC Oct 8, 2012 Kaitlyn Terrana diagnosed with mysterious Kleine-Levin syndrome li-sleeping-beauty-620-0339.jpg Kaitlyn Terrana, 17, has developed an extremely rare disease called Kleine-Levin syndrome, dubbed "Sleeping Beauty" disease, that's marked by intermittent episodes in which she sleeps 16 or more hours a day for 10 days at a time. (Sheryl Nadler/Canadian Press) There was nothing sweet about Kaitlyn Terrana's 16th birthday. And she has virtually no recollection of her last birthday, her 17th, either. She slept through both of them. At a time when the teenager should be living each day to the fullest, she is trapped in a roughly six-week cycle in which she has no choice but to take to her bed, slumbering for about 10 days at a time. Kaitlyn has developed an extremely rare condition called Kleine-Levin syndrome, or KLS, and it is stealing her life away. "Kind of like the day before, I start feeling really tired and it's really hard for me to focus in class," she says from her home in Winona, Ont., near Hamilton. "And then after that, I'm just gone for 10 days. I have to sleep, I can't stay awake." Her mom, Kathy Terrana, has to closely monitor Kaitlyn when she experiences one of these sleeping periods, saying her daughter can't be left alone. "In the beginning of her episodes, she starts off being very, very tired," she says. "By late evening I can usually tell that, yes, she is starting an episode, because she doesn't talk, she doesn't converse with anybody. It's not very nice to say, but it's almost like she's a walking zombie, because when they're in their episodes they can be walking around but they don't know what's going on around them. So there's no empathy, there's no feeling whatsoever. She's in a complete fog." 20-hour stretches of sleep Once an episode starts, Kaitlyn can easily sleep 20 or more hours at a stretch, says Terrana, who periodically wakes her daughter to take her to the bathroom, give her liquids and food. But those meals must be carefully controlled because of another characteristic of Kleine-Levin syndrome -- a voracious appetite. "I monitor her food intake because otherwise she will walk to a cupboard and just binge on anything that's available," says Terrana. "It's like they're in a starving mode when they wake up. They just eat anything and everything in sight." Kaitlyn knows her mom wakes her up to use the bathroom and to eat and drink, but she doesn't remember anything about those times away from her bed, even though she's supposedly awake. "It's kind of like a dream," she says, struggling to put words to the feeling. "If you look back into your dreams, you remember certain things but not everything. It doesn't connect. That's how 10 days of my life is. So you look back and it's all foggy and it doesn't make sense." No treatments, cure Little is known about KLS because the condition is so rare. Doctors don't know what causes it and there are no treatments or cure. The syndrome affects at least twice as many boys as girls and onset is usually during adolescence. Typically, the episodes last from 10 to 15 years, then disappear as mysteriously as they began. Kaitlyn had her first attack two years ago when she was 15 and in Grade 10. "Basically, I started feeling really weird. I felt really off. I couldn't focus in school," she recalls of that month-long first attack. "Then out of nowhere I came out of it and I was back to normal. Basically, it felt like I was drugged for an entire month. I was confused about a lot of things. I looked at my (school) notes and my notes weren't written properly. And my notes are always neat and I always write everything down. Right away I knew something was really, really wrong. That's not me at all." Initially, her mom thought her excessive sleepiness might be the result of depression. She tried to get her out of bed to go to school. She encouraged her to go out with friends. "I didn't know what she had. I thought she just didn't want to talk," she says. Difficult to diagnose Terrana took her daughter to a therapist. She was also seen by doctors, who diagnosed her with partial complex seizures, one of the neurological conditions that has characteristics that mimic but don't fully match KLS. She was prescribed a number of drugs  antidepressants as well as sleep and antiseizure medications  but they made Kaitlyn worse, her mother says. It wasn't until she saw Dr. David Callen 18 months after her first episode that Kaitlyn got her KLS diagnosis. "There's a couple of reasons why it's so difficult to diagnose, first because it is so rare, it's only like one in a million," says Callen, a pediatric neurologist at McMaster University's Children's Hospital in Hamilton. "And secondly, there are no diagnostic tests, so we can't do an MRI and say 'Oh yeah, you have Kleine-Levin syndrome.' We can't do blood work and say 'Oh, yeah, you have the factors associated with this.' There have been tests that have been looked at, but there really is nothing that has been shown to be useful in actually making a diagnosis." Callen says the diagnosis is based on a combination of specific symptoms that occur with excessive sleepiness, among them compulsive eating, cognitive and mood disturbances, or hypersexuality, the latter mostly experienced by males with the condition. While some patients recall having had a flu-like illness before their first episode, Callen says there is no evidence to support a theory that KLS might be an autoimmune disorder. The syndrome's cause and its decade-plus duration remain a mystery. "Often these episodes cease in their third or fourth decade of life," he says of those afflicted. "It can be a long time and the episodes can last for days and they are very disruptive." Missing out on school, social life Indeed, one of Kaitlyn's biggest worries is that she is missing so much school. This semester she is taking only a couple of Grade 12 classes and has given up the idea of going to university next year along with her classmates. "It's affecting my schooling greatly because even though the school tries to accommodate me as much as they can, it's still difficult for me because I miss 10 days at a time and I have to catch up on what I missed plus the lessons I'm learning in class," she says. "By the time I get caught up, it happens again, which is very stressful." Kaitlyn's dream is to work in the health-care field in some capacity, and she has no idea if or when she will be able to realize that ambition. Her social life is also tenuous. Never knowing when she will have an episode meant not signing up for a class trip to Montreal, and she had to turn down a friend's invitation to go to Cuba early next year. While she has a group of supportive friends, including a boyfriend, she says she has lost several friends because of her illness. She has even been bullied online by one former friend who accused her of faking KLS to get attention  a charge for which there is no evidence, Callen confirms. "It's really hard for me," Kaitlyn says, fighting back tears . "I try so hard to persevere, but I just keep getting brought down by this." Even so, she is trying to raise awareness of KLS and to raise money for research being conducted at Stanford University in California. "I'm not doing this for myself. I'm doing this for the next batch of people who get diagnosed with KLS, so they know they're not the only ones out there with it," says Kaitlyn, who was contacted by a Hamilton man with the syndrome after her story ran in a local newspaper. That article also mentioned that KLS has been dubbed "Sleeping Beauty" disease, a moniker some readers took umbrage with, given how it affects young people's lives. "It doesn't bother me," Kaitlyn says of the name. "It's just the fact that it's not a pretty syndrome. When you think of a Sleeping Beauty, you think of like a princess. And we're nothing like that when we're in that state." 
 For the past three months or so I have not been able to sleep at night. I get tired in the morning and will sleep for a couple of hours but can't seem to go to sleep regularly no matter what I do. I'm getting more and more confused and not really sure what day it is sometimes. I have a hard time leaving the house. My doctor gave me Melatonin but it doesn't work. I have a lot of energy at night and none in the day. Not sure what to do. I have a drs. appt next week. TG 
 I'm not laughing any more. The 2 1/2 year sleep issue has finally driven me insane. I've had periods where I've slept good in the last couple of years but those days have been far lived. Hardly any good nights of sleep. Tonight I can't even shut my eyes I'm so awake. I exercised today and had a shower, no caffeine, no iPhone after 9.30pm. Now it's just before midnight and I'm going crazy I can't even lay here and relax at least. I spoke with the nurses. They want to give me 14mg Imovane which has helped me in the past but then my body got used to it. Now I haven't been on it for a while so I hope it helps. The on-call psychiatrist is due to arrive in 15 minutes or so. The last two nights I've managed to fall asleep with no meds at 10pm no troubles and sleep at least for a few hours before waking up a few times. Before these two days, I slept for one night 19 hours (!) which I have never managed to do in my life. And before that, I had slept for 3 nights a maximum of 3 hours of sleep a night (what they have now said was hypomania) but was wide awake all day and not tired whatsoever. All over the place. Asides from getting my anti-depressant, mood stabiliser and perhaps sleep med at the right level, I see no way out of this. I've tried everything in the book. 
 7 Tips to Improve Your Sleep! by Dr Aletta May 11, 2012 Here are a few quick tips to improve the quality of your sleep: Only use your bed for sleep, sex, and reading that trashy novel your book club doesnt know about. No TV!Create a soothing bedroom that engages all five senses. Lavender scents, soft cotton sheets, low amber light, quiet, soothing music, even vanilla flavored toothpaste!After the sun sets keep lights low. Think of it as mimicking a camp fire, which signals the brain to release sleep hormones.Have a before-bedtime ritual, such as washing your face, brushing teeth, putting on pajamas, stretching, prayers, light reading then lights out.Go to bed and get up at the same time (within half an hour) every day! This is very importnat even on the weekends.Exercise but not within four hours of bedtime.Remember to breathe! Once you are in bed, breathe a few deep yoga breaths and relax. Do not be concerned about sleep. Your only desire is to relax. Sleep is essential to our health generally and our sanity in particular. Interrogators know, if you want to break someone down  deprive them of sleep. I didnt appreciate how important sleep was until I became sleep deprived myself. About six years ago, anxiety fed my insomnia, which in turn fed my anxiety. It finally drove me to my doctors office. Surely something was very wrong with my thyroid or maybe I had a brain tumor! A complete workup that took two days and many little tubes of blood then I met with my medical specialist. With unforgettable kindness he asked what was going on in my life. As I ticked off about five pretty high stress events, I could see where he was going with this, and I didnt like it. He said, Well, that would do it for me! So the good news was my brain and thyroid were fine, the not so good newsit was all in my head. No, it couldnt be! I was a psychologist for Gods sake! Wouldnt I know if stress was making me sick? Turns out, if you are overwhelmed, even if you are a qualified mental health professional, you are often the last to know. A humbling lesson. The frog in the pot syndrome a over again. ANYWAY For a couple of weeks I took a sleep medication to get my sleep back on track. Then I got a crash course on sleep hygiene, learned how to breathe to calm down my anxiety and took a serious look at what I could change in my life to allow a better balance. These are lessons I learn over and over again and now pass on to my clients. For really serious sleep troubles I use cognitive behavioral therapy, the best non-medication treatment for insomnia.

 Smoking, Pesticides Might Spur Rare 'Sleep-Kicking' Disorder U.S. News and World Report June 27, 2012 Having disorder may raise risk of Parkinson's, dementia, researcher adds Smoking and exposure to pesticides are two factors that could raise the risk for a rare disorder that causes people to sometimes kick, punch or otherwise move about while asleep, a new study suggests. REM sleep involves vivid dreams and, for most individuals, no movement other than breathing and the namesake rapid eye movement. However, with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), people act out their dreams in various ways, such as talking, jerking, kicking or getting out of bed and running around. This often happens at the peril of themselves and the people with whom they share their bed, but experts say one of the biggest concerns with RBD is that it can be an early sign of a serious neurodegenerative disorder, such as Parkinson's disease or a type of dementia related to Parkinson's called dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). To identify possible risk factors for developing RBD, researchers asked people at sleep clinics around the world about their diet, lifestyle and medical and educational backgrounds. They found that people with RBD were more likely than people who did not have RBD to smoke cigarettes, have pesticide exposure and have suffered a head injury. The study, which was published online June 27 in the journal Neurology, represents the first look at RBD risk factors. "The only thing we knew was that patients tend to be men and that they tend to be older," said study author Dr. Ron Postuma, associate professor of neurology at McGill University in Montreal. Knowing more about RBD risk factors will improve the understanding of Parkinson's and DLB, he added. Shelby Freedman Harris, director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, said this study is a great start. "There will be more studies coming out looking at risk factors," she said. RBD is rare compared with conditions like sleepwalking, which occurs during a different phase of sleep, Postuma explained. Previous research has found that one in 200 people have RBD, but Postuma thinks that number probably does not include mild cases. Having RBD puts someone at much higher risk of developing Parkinson's or DLB -- between 38 percent and 75 percent of people with RBD also have a neurodegenerative disorder -- but people can have RBD for a decade or more before they develop one of those disorders, Postuma said. For the study, Postuma and his colleagues recruited nearly 350 people with RBD from sleep clinics in the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan. The patients' average age was 67, and 81 percent of the group was male. Because these participants were already going to a sleep clinic, they tended to have more severe cases of RBD, Postuma said. The participants did not have Parkinson's or dementia. The control group included 281 people who had unrelated sleep problems, such as sleep apnea and insomnia, and 129 people with no sleep problems. The researchers asked the participants about their exposure to many factors that have been associated with increased risk of Parkinson's or DLB, such as caffeine intake and head injuries. They found that the biggest risk factor for RBD was pesticide exposure, which is also a risk factor for Parkinson's. People in the RBD group were more than twice as likely as the non-RBD group to have been exposed to pesticides at work. There was no association, however, between pesticide use outside of work and having RBD, probably because the exposure levels for this group would have been very low, Postuma said. Postuma and his colleagues found that head injury, which also is a risk factor for both Parkinson's and DLB, was 59 percent more likely in the group with RBD. Less education has been linked to dementia, and the current study found people with RBD had been in school for about 1.5 fewer years, on average, than the control group. The reason for the association between education and RBD is unclear, but it could be that people with less education have different types of dreams that cause them to act out less, Harris said. The relationship among certain factors was different for RBD and Parkinson's. Whereas caffeine intake and cigarette smoking seem to protect people against Parkinson's symptoms, the researchers found no association between caffeine use and RBD risk and that smoking increased the risk of having RBD by 43 percent. "I find that quite interesting," Postuma said. "It makes you think about the mechanisms of these diseases." The study found an association -- not a cause-and-effect link -- between these various factors and the risk of RBD. Some forms of Parkinson's probably involve degeneration of nerve cells in the sleep region of the brain before the disease strikes the motor areas, causing tremors and coordination problems, Postuma explained. Not all patients with RBD will develop Parkinson's or DLB, however, and it may be that some forms of RBD affect only the part of the brain involved in sleep regulation, he added. "People who have RBD should see a neurologist," Postuma said. Even though it is not possible to prevent Parkinson's or DLB, doctors can monitor these patients and make sure they get the best treatment to manage their disease. RBD is also treatable, and the most common medication is clonazepam (brand name Klonopin), which can relax muscles during sleep, Harris said. "The first thing we always do is modify the sleep environment to reduce the risk of injury," she said. Postuma and his colleagues are now studying other factors that could increase the risk of RBD, including family history and certain medications and diseases.

 For going on a month now I have been waking up near 6:30 a.m. and usually get up for the day. This would not be bad if I worked a typical shift but the earliest I get home from work is 12:30 a.m. and don't get to bed before 2:00 a.m. I am o.k. for most of my day but later into my work night I poop out and my drive home really concerns me. I see my doctor tomorrow and will discuss this with him. I think an underlying problem is the need to get things done and that sleep is getting in the way. I know this is irrational but it is anxiety that is winning this battle right now. 
 Sleep problems may contribute to cognitive decline By Michael J. Breus, Ph.D., Psychology Today Aug 11, 2012 A group of studies, all conducted independently, have reached a similar sobering conclusion: sleep problems—including several common sleep difficulties faced by millions of people on a regular basis—may, over time, lead to cognitive impairment and even dementia. Four studies presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference investigated the possible relationship between sleep disorders and cognitive function among older adults. Each study looked at the question from a different angle, and used different methods to obtain results. The collective result? A watershed of information that some of our most common sleep troubles—including sleep deprivation, oversleeping, daytime tiredness, and sleep-disordered breathing—may play a significant role in cognitive decline as we age. Sleeping too little—or too much—linked to cognitive decline Researchers at Brigham & Women’s Hospital, Boston used data from the Nurses’ Health Study to examine risk factors for cognitive problems in older adults. The Nurses’ Health Study is a landmark, long-running, and ongoing study of women’s health, using information collected from thousands of nurse-participants. To investigate the relationship between sleep and cognitive decline, researchers examined data from 15,263 women, all of whom were 70 years or older at the time of the first cognitive assessment. The women received follow-up cognitive tests every other year for the following 6 years. Participants were also asked to report their daily sleep patterns and habits. Researchers found that sleeping too little and sleeping too much were both associated with cognitive decline over time: Women who slept 5 hours a day or less had lower average cognitive scores than women who slept 7 hours per dayWomen who slept more than 9 hours had lower average scores than women who slept 7 hours per dayWomen whose sleep duration changed by more than 2 hours—up or down—had lower cognitive assessment scores than women whose daily sleep patterns did not change significantlyIn a small subgroup of women, researchers analyzed blood samples for changes in protein levels that are considered markers for changes to the brain that are associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Women who slept more or less than 7 hours were more likely to show evidence of these Alzheimer-indicative changes to protein levels. Sleep-disordered breathing may increase risk of dementia A study led by scientists at University of California San Francisco, also examined the relationship between cognitive function and sleep disorders among older women. In this study researchers did not use self-reported information about sleep. Instead, they measured sleep quality and quantity among 1309 women ages 75 and older, over a period of several days. Researchers used polysomnography and wrist sensors to collect detailed data about physical changes that occurred during sleep—including brain activity and breathing—as well as information about rest and activity levels. Five years later, the women were given tests to measure their cognitive functioning. The results of this study showed a connection between disrupted sleep—especially sleep-disordered breathing—and diminished cognitive function: Women with sleep-disordered breathing were more than two times as likely to show evidence of dementia than women without sleep-disordered breathingWomen who showed signs of disrupted sleep cycles were also more likely to demonstrate cognitive problems and dementia.Total sleep time was not associated with cognitive decline among these women. However, women who experienced greater periods of nighttime wakefulness scored lower on their cognitive function tests. A preliminary version of these results was published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Daytime sleepiness may be a risk for cognitive impairment An international group of researchers, from INSERM and Stanford University, used data from the Three-City Study to examine the effect of sleep on cognitive function among men and women age 65 and older. The study used self-reported sleep information from 4,894 adults, including details on trouble falling asleep and staying asleep, poor sleep quality, waking early, and daytime sleepiness. Participants were given cognitive assessments every 2 years over a 10-year period. In contrast with some of the other findings on sleep and cognition presented at AAIC, researchers in this study did not find that sleep duration, or difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, were associated with cognitive decline. They did find, however, that excessive daytime sleepiness was associated with diminishing cognitive function among these older adults. Do disruptions to circadian rhythms lead to dementia? A fourth study examined a hypothesis related to Alzheimer’s disease: that abnormal levels of a particular protein known as amyloid-beta contributes to dementia. Changes in the body’s production and clearance of this protein are considered a bio-marker for Alzheimer’s disease. Levels of amyloid-beta protein naturally change in the body over time, and also fluctuate within a 24-hour period, and we don’t currently know a lot about why or how these natural cycles work. This limited understanding makes accurately measuring and tracking abnormalities more difficult. Scientists at St. Louis’ Washington University School of Medicine examined changes in amyloid-beta protein in relation to circadian rhythms, and found that the protein’s daily fluctuations conform to circadian patterns, suggesting that disruptions to circadian rhythms—which happen with age as well as with disordered sleep—may affect the production and regulation of this protein linked to dementia. This is a lot to digest. In the case of each study, there is more work to be done to establish a causal link between disrupted sleep and cognitive decline. We’re still a long way from a real understanding about just how sleep affects cognitive function over the course of a lifetime, and how lack of sleep may contribute to the onset of dementia or other conditions involving cognitive impairment and decline. But such unanimity among the results of no fewer than four separate studies certainly feels like the sounding of an alarm. 
 I've been going to bed at 1am consistently for the last seven weeks and tonight I went at 9:30pm because I'm back to work at 6am. Between a different schedule that I failed to plan for (although I could catch the last 17 minutes of Golden Girls) and the wicked lightening storm outside, I am w-I-d-e awake! Pity the dude who is trying to get to Purto Vallarta tomorrow and I send him to Prince George (although I'm sure it's lovely there too!). And of course it's too late to take another sleeping pill. Really...what could go wrong in seven short hours at work? 
 Sleep Apnea Treatments Help Reduce Depression Symptoms By Stephanie Corkett, NAMI Communications Intern July 31, 2012 A new study conducted by the Cleveland Clinic Sleep Disorders Center confirms that positive airway pressure, a treatment for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), also lessens symptoms of depression. Researchers found that patients who used continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) showed reduced signs of their depression symptoms even if they only partially followed a treatment plan. OSA is a sleep-related breathing disorder where the body stops breathing during the night due to collapsed tissues in the back of the throat which block the airway. This results in disturbed sleep which could lead to serious health issues including heart disease and stroke. The most common treatment for OSA is CPAP which is delivered through a mask worn over the face of the patient. [Check out NAMI’s updated information on sleep apnea.] Results showed that all subjects saw improvements in depressive symptoms and patients who used their CPAP devices for more than four hours showed even greater improvements on their scores than others who didn’t follow their treatment schedule as strictly. “The score improvements remained significant even after taking into account whether a patient had a prior diagnosis of depression or was taking an antidepressant,” said Charles Bae, M.D., head investigator of the study in a news release. “The improvements were greatest in sleepy, adherent patients but even nonadherent patients had better scores.” This study was presented at the annual meeting of the Associate Professional Sleep Societies in Boston. “Getting a good night’s sleep is protective of the brain,” says NAMI Medical Director Ken Duckworth, M.D. “Evidence suggests that good sleep and a regular routine help protect against the recurrence of mania.” For a better night’s sleep Duckworth recommends cutting down on alcohol and caffeine as well as skipping afternoon naps. For more information about better sleep techniques, view Duckworth’s article in NAMI’s Advocate. 
 Or something along those lines. My sleep pattern has been messed up for a while now, I've told my doctor about this since day 1 of seeing him and having been taken into the emergency room back end of January. Just NOW he has finally decided that maybe I need something to help me sleep. Well I've been on Zopiclone for almost a month now...not quite, I'm to take 1 - 2 pills nightly, though it says when needed :| and they're 7.5 mg tablets. They don't work...at least they don't help me sleep. I get dizzy and get horrible migraines when I take them, and I get that unfortunate metallic taste and dry mouth from it. I can take them and even after 4 hours not be asleep or even remotely tired, which when not sleeping for 2 - 3 days in a row is a little terrifying. I'm not sure why it's not working, I've NEVER been on any kind of sleeping pill before in my life. I hate them, I hate the thought of them, but if they're necessary I'm willing to try them. I'm going out on a limb and wondering if there's anything else I can do? I feel silly taking them 4-5 hours before I want to sleep especially for the chance they might not work. All I want to do is sleep. 
 Since I was a child, I have had dreams that I am someone else. Sometimes I will wake up in the middle of the night and wonder "why am I dreaming that I'm a 12 year old boy named Billy?". But it's not just Billy that I dream about, there's a whole assortment of people that I am in my dreams, but mostly, different aged kids. Sometimes, I'm a 6 year old girl and other times I'm a 7 year old boy,etc. And they have been consistent through the years, meaning they have always been the same kids with the same names. The dreams aren't in 3rd person or anything, I AM these different kids,and the dreams feel so real. If I am dreaming that I'm Billy, I am experiencing life as a 12 year old boy,and all the thoughts and emotions of someone that age. Sometimes I dream that I am myself as a child, and I am re-living some of the things that happened,except I am doing things differently. For example, I had a dream where I was watching someone being sexually abused,and I started saying, in my dream, "I would tell someone now, I wouldn't just stand here and watch". I think I understand having those types of dreams, but I don't understand the dreams of being someone else. I haven't really talked about this with anyone because it just seems weird to me, and I haven't heard anyone else talk about it, so I don't want to seem as strange as I feel about having the dreams.But I am talking about it now because I want to understand it. I hope this doesn't sound too far 'out there' and someone can help me understand. 
 I'm in a state between having vivid dreams, then opening my eyes and being awake and having visions of my dead grandmother. I don't know what's real and what's not. Maybe she is coming to me in real life. In the last four hours, I've had 4mg Clonazepam and 80mg Clozapine. It's very confusing and disturbing. I wonder what is causing this. The new med maybe? 
 How to Sleep Better by Dr. Will Meek June 7, 2012 Difficulty sleeping and being tired during the day are two of the most common concerns that my clients have. The following will cover some general sleep tips, and give concrete ideas to help make you an expert sleeper. Sleep Theory The consensus understanding among cognitive scientists and psychologists is that sleep is a vital process for our bodies to restore themselves. Think of it as a time where small repairs are done on all of your physical and cognitive systems; where your cells do a housecleaning that allows you to be strong, healthy, and functioning at your best. When we don't sleep the amount we need, our physical and mental systems start to have minor malfunctions, and the effect is that we generally feel sluggish and edgy, are more prone to making mistakes during our daily lives, and are more likely to get sick. Not getting enough sleep over many weeks, months, or even years can lead to serious health problems. It is also now widely understood that everyone needs a slightly different amount of sleep to be at their best. A good rule of thumb is 8 +/- 1 hour, although a small minority of people may need even more or less than that. Insomnia Everyone experiences occasional nights of being restless, or not being able to fall or stay asleep. Generally, we use the term "insomnia" to describe these patterns. The causes of insomnia are wide ranging, and include caffeine, stress and anxiety, sleep disorders, lights being too bright, a recent loss, a snoring bed partner, depression, worry about a health problem or work, and an uncomfortable mattress, among many others. That makes finding a solution to insomnia, and the other issues that come from it, more complicated than it may first appear. The Basics of Sleeping Well The first level of improving your sleep hygiene is to make sure you are giving yourself the best chance for a good night of sleep. These things include: 1. No drugs: Avoid caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, and other substances before sleep. Some of these will simply prevent you from falling asleep, and others may help you fall asleep initially but will interfere with your regular sleep cycles and either cause you to wake up or get less restorative sleep. 2. No heavy meals: Having a light snack an hour before bed is not a problem for most people, but eating a large meal or heavier foods will be work against you. 3. No recent exercise: Working out at night within a couple hours of your sleep time will make it more difficult for you to fall asleep. 4. Comfortable sleeping environment: Make sure your room is a favorable temperature for sleep, that your bed is comfortable, and that the room is appropriately dark and free from random noises. 5. Establish a routine. The best sleepers among us have a standard bedtime ritual that actually serves to prepare their bodies for sleep. Developing a routine of turning off lights, drinking a glass of water, brushing your teeth, and laying down tells your body that it is time to prepare for sleep. 6. Improve your physical health. Getting other parts of your health in balance will also have a positive impact on sleeping. So work on developing a good exercise routine and eating a healthy diet. Advanced Sleeping If you have mastered all of the things above but you're still having problems, there are more things you can do to get things balanced out. However, some of these processes can be more difficult to maintain, so they take an extra commitment. 1. Wake up the same time everyday no matter what. This is usually the most painful part of the process of people, but decide the earliest you need to be up during the week, and start waking up at that time everyday no matter what. After two weeks of doing this, your body should be ready to get going at that time. The key here is not sleeping in, ever, and the result is recalibrating your internal clock. 2. Don't lay down until you are tired. If it's really late and you need to get up at that early time as usual, but you aren't tired yet, then just keep doing things. But once you do get tired, go to bed. 3. If you don't fall asleep in 15 minutes, get up and do something else. Most people that struggle with insomnia or sleep issues toss and turn and get frustrated that they aren't sleeping. Instead of that, get up and do something relaxing like reading a book or meditating, but stay away from computer screens and bright lights. 4. Don't take naps. To keep things regulated, avoid naps during the day. If you simply cannot avoid taking a nap, don't make it longer than about 20 minutes. Anything else will start to mess up the process you are working on. Dealing with Insomnia So if you have a) done all of the above and are still having trouble with sleep, or b) you're generally a pretty good sleeper but are having a period of insomnia, there is another approach. Basically, all of the above approaches are about trying to change what your body and mind are doing so that you can sleep better. But if those methods of change aren't working, rather than fighting sleeplessness, I suggest making peace with it. Essentially, if you aren't falling asleep, simply accept that your body wants something else. Instead of getting frustrated, find out what that is, and make it happen. For example, if you are ruminating on life stresses that are preventing sleep, use that time to get up and work on making plans, solving the problems you are stressing about, or doing more work and preparation. If instead you find that your body just has more energy left, then find something to do that can use it, like going for a slow walk around your neighborhood, playing with a pet, doing something creative, having a sexual release, writing, or reading a book. Other Stuff Chronic insomnia, fatigue, or sleep other issues can also be a symptom of a more involved problem like depression and anxiety disorders, abuse history, sleep disorders, physical health issues, unsafe environments, reoccurring nightmares, obesity, and trauma. If any these things are involved, the above sleep ideas may not be effective, and consulting with a psychologist or doctor would be indicated. Additionally, there are many home remedies and alternative treatments for sleep problems that are worth mentioning. First, there is some research support for light therapy. To read more about it, this free ebook is a great resource: Brighten Your Life. Second, supplements like melatonin seem to benefit some people. Finally, although there is a growing backlash in the medical and psychological communities about sleeping pills like Ambien, they may also be helpful for people with more severe concerns. Conclusion In summary, everyone that has ever lived has had some sleepless nights. I hope the above ideas can help generate new approaches to deal with sleep problems, and know that counseling can be helpful. 
 Sleepwalking in Adults More Common Than Thought Doctors' Lounge May 14, 2012 Large study found nearly 4 percent wander at night, often tied to mental woes.By Maureen Salamon HealthDay Reporter Sleepwalkers on TV and in movies are often played for drama or laughs, but the phenomenon is surprisingly common in American households, a large, new study suggests. In what they said is the first research in three decades on sleepwalking prevalence in the United States, scientists from Stanford University School of Medicine found that about 3.6 percent of U.S. adults are prone to sleepwalking, a higher proportion than previously thought. Nocturnal wandering is also tied to certain psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. "It's probably more common than we realize, which doesn't surprise me," said Dr. B. Tucker Woodson, professor and chief of the division of sleep medicine at Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, who wasn't involved in the study. "As clinicians we often see the cases in which it's a problem, so if the occasional sleepwalking episode is not causing any problems, it tends not to be something people seek medical attention for." The study is published May 15 in the journal Neurology. Study author Dr. Maurice Ohayon, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford, and his colleagues interviewed about 19,000 people aged 18 and older from 15 states, questioning them about their sleeping habits, general health, medications taken and mental disorders. Those who reported sleepwalking were asked about the frequency, duration, family history and any inappropriate or potentially dangerous behaviors during sleep. Nearly 30 percent of participants reported having sleepwalked at least once in their lifetime, while nearly one-third of the 3.6 percent who had done so within the previous year said they sleepwalked twice or more each month. Family history was a strong predictor, with about 30 percent of those who sleepwalked at least once in the previous year having family members who also experienced the disorder. "When you have one episode of sleepwalking per month at minimum, you are disturbed by the disorder, no doubt," Ohayon said. "More than once a month is a lot of episodes in a year. It could be harmful for them ... because they don't have the normal reactions. So it could be a big accident coming, but happily that's very rare." Participants who had experienced depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder were 3.5 times and 3.9 times more likely to sleepwalk, respectively, than people without the conditions, the study found. Those who took antidepressants known as SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, were three times more likely to sleepwalk twice a month or more. Ohayon cautioned that it's not clear whether the psychiatric conditions themselves or drugs used to treat them were responsible for the heightened sleepwalking incidence. "An association doesn't mean you have a causality link," he said. "It means at maximum, the SSRIs are triggering sleepwalking, but are not the cause. That is clear." Participants using over-the-counter sleeping pills had a higher chance of reporting sleepwalking at least twice a month, while gender and race weren't associated with the disorder and it seemed to lessen with age. Ohayon and Woodson agreed that longitudinal research needs to be done that can examine the long-term factors contributing to sleepwalking, which wasn't possible in this cross-sectional study. "Sleepwalking is a really interesting phenomenon in that it represents the brain in different states -- part of the brain, in a sense, is awake, and part is asleep," Woodson said. "We're learning that other disorders may have similar brain activity . . . with mixed states of wake and sleep. I don't think we understand them all that well. Most are not associated with serious medical consequences, but obviously sometimes they can be." More information The U.S. National Library of Medicine has more about sleepwalking.

 Beyond Drowsy: Too Little Sleep Ups Diabetes Risk April 17, 2012 More people pull the night shift. Teens text past midnight and stumble to class at dawn. Travelers pack red-eye flights. Nodding off behind the wheel isn't the only threat from a lack of shut-eye. There's growing evidence that people who regularly sleep too little and at the wrong time suffer long-lasting consequences that a nap won't cure: An increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and other health problems. "We have a societal conspiracy for sleep deprivation," says Russell Sanna of Harvard Medical School's sleep medicine division, who attended a TEDMED conference last week where scientists called sleep loss one of health care's big challenges. Just how unhealthy is it? Consider how sleep may play a role in the nation's diabetes epidemic. Studies have long shown that people who sleep fewer than five hours a night have an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, the kind that tends to strike later in life. Rotating shift work -- three or more night shifts a month interspersed with day or evening hours -- raises the risk, too, says a recent report from researchers who analyzed years of medical records from the huge Nurses' Health Study. Diet and physical activity are big factors in Type 2 diabetes. Certainly it's harder to work out or choose an apple over a doughnut when you're tired, especially at 3 a.m. when your body's internal clock knows you should be sleeping. But a study published last week shows sleep plays a more complex role than that. As sleep drops and normal biological rhythms are disrupted, your body physically changes in ways that can help set the stage for diabetes, reports neuroscientist Orfeu Buxton of Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital. Buxton's team had 21 healthy volunteers spend almost six weeks living in a laboratory where their diet, physical activity, sleep and even the light was strictly controlled. The volunteers started out well-rested. But for three of those weeks, they were allowed only about 5 1/2 hours of sleep every 24 hours -- at varying times of the day or night, to mimic a bad shift rotation or prolonged jet lag. That knocked out of whack the body's "circadian rhythm," a master biological clock that regulates such patterns as when we become sleepy and how body temperature rises and falls. What happened was startling: Blood sugar levels increased after meals, sometimes to pre-diabetic levels, because the pancreas stopped secreting enough insulin, Buxton reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine. At the same time, the volunteers' metabolic rate slowed by 8 percent. The researchers had them on a diet so they didn't gain weight -- but Buxton says typically, a metabolism drop of that size could mean gaining 10 to 12 pounds over a year. The results make sense, says Dr. Michael Thorpy, sleep center director at New York's Montefiore Medical Center and a neurology professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. "If we're going to spend a third of our day sleeping, there's got to be a good reason for it," says Thorpy, who notes that diabetes is far from the only worry. Up to 70 million Americans are estimated to suffer from chronic problems with sleep, from insomnia to sleep apnea. Impaired sleep has been linked to high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, depression, memory impairment and a weakened immune system. Still another concern: The World Health Organization has classified night shift work as a probable carcinogen, because too much light at night may hamper a hormone involved both with sleep and suppressing tumor cells. Don't people adjust to the night shift if they're on it long enough? Buxton says rotating shifts probably are most worrisome. In his study, the volunteers' bodies went back to normal after nine nights of sufficient sleep at the right time. No one knows how long it takes before sleep deprivation and an off-kilter biological clock may cause permanent damage. Montefiore's Thorpy says natural night owls seem to adapt better to night shifts, but that people never fully adapt if they swing back to daytime schedules on their days off. Also, about 30 percent of regular night workers have trouble sleeping during their off hours or are particularly fatigued, he says, something termed "shift work disorder." The consumer message: The National Institutes of Health says adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep daily for good health. If you work nights, go straight to bed when you get home, Buxton advises. Avoid too much light along the way. Thorpy says wearing yellow- or orange-tinted sunglasses on the drive home can block short-wavelength "blue light" that triggers wakefulness. Let natural light help keep your biological sleep clock on schedule, advises Harvard's sleep-education Web site. For most people, sunlight in the morning is key. For the night shift, more bright light in the evening shifts people's internal clock, Buxton explains. For anyone, a sleep-inducing bedroom is one that's dark, quiet and cool. Avoid caffeine, alcohol and stressful situations near bedtime. Electronics right before bed aren't advised, either. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day also helps. 
 Your Guide to Better Sleep By Hara Estroff Marano, Psychology Today on October 20, 2003 We all know that sleep is crucial to having the energy and ability to perform whatever it is we want to do. All it takes is one or two sleepless nights to drive home that pointand we all have a sleepless night or two sometimes. It's the cost of being human and having the capacity to worry about the future and chew over the past. Yet, it's what we do in response to a bout of insomnia that determines whether we will end up with long-term sleep problems. The fact is that the sleep system tends to right itself after a few nights of insomniaprovided you make no adjustments to your sleep-wake cycle. Unfortunately, most people take special measures to get some rest. They nap in the afternoon or evening. Or they go to bed early the next night, or sleep late the following morning. Or they take a drink or two to fall asleep. Every one of these "corrective" measures interferes with your body's sleep "homeostat," a mechanism that builds up pressure for sleep and helps assure a good night's rest. The homeostatic pressure for sleep depends on how long you have been awakeand how active you are while awake. I spoke to Dr. Michael Perlis, head of behavioral sleep medicine at the University of Rochester. An expert on insomnia, he has plenty of advice to offer on how to get the rest you need while steering clear of sleep problems. Get more exercisephysical and mental. It primes the sleep homeostat. It's a myth that exercise at bedtime is bad. Sex is, among other things, a great exercise.Set a regular bedtimeand keep it. Your body needs reliability.Set up conditions so that you catch the wave of sleep. Sleep has to be permitted. Take obstacles out of the way, and give up the notion that you can control sleep.Learn simple meditation and practice it before bedtime; it cuts down nervous system arousal.Put sleep in the background of your life. Don't monitor it, don't evaluate it.Jack up your body temperature with a warm bath before bed. Exaggerating the normal drop in body temperature that accompanies lying down abets sleep.Keep your bedroom dark, especially as you get older. Even small amounts of light and noise can disturb sleep as you age.Don't overheat your environment. Sleep loves cold. Keep your bedroom cold but load up on blankets.Less is more. The less you do in response to a bout of sleeplessness, the faster your sleep patterns will return to normal.Keeping your wake-up time constant but going to bed one hour later will help 25 percent of insomniacs in one to two weeks. Prepare to feel sleepy at times and avoid driving then. After two weeks, add back the time in half-hour increments.Look on two or three nights of insomnia as a giftthe gift of time you wanted to get done all that you have to get done. Insomnia may be functional, a signal that you need to attend to what got you up.Don't fight the insomnia. The homeostat makes sleep a self-reparative systemif you stay out of its way.Don't worry about the consequences of not sleeping. Worrying about insomnia can create insomnia.Don't sleep with your pets! Animal dander can create allergies that manifest only at night, and the movement of any pet on your bed can wake you up.Do not sleep later to make up for lost sleep. It de-primes the sleep homeostat and reduces pressure for sleep the next night, turning a night of sleeplessness into insomnia.Don't make up for a night of sleeplessness by napping. That undermines the sleep homeostat and makes it less likely you will sleep through the next night.Don't make up for an acute bout of insomnia by going to bed early.Do not try to induce sleepiness by drinking alcohol. Yes, it's a great relaxantbut it is metabolized so quickly it creates rebound insomnia within the night; it's so fast-acting you'll be up in four short hours.Limit caffeine to one cup of coffee in the morning. At age 18, caffeine has a half-life of 4.5 hours, which increases with age. Gradually eliminate caffeine altogether if you have trouble sleeping.

 Spring forward, fall asleep by P.J. Skerrett, Harvard Health Blog March 9, 2012 This weekend, most Americans [followed] the annual ritual of setting their clocks ahead one hourand losing an hour of sleep in the process... According to sleep expert Dr. Charles Czeisler, U.S. researchers have seen increases of 6% to 17% in motor vehicle crashes on the Mondays after we set our clocks forward. Data collected over a 20-year period in Sweden shows a 5% increase in heart attacks during the week that follows the start of Daylight Saving Time. Czeisler, who is chief of the Division of Sleep Medicine at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston, was speaking on a Webcast called Fighting the Clock: How Americas Sleep Deficit is Damaging Long-term Health produced by the Harvard School of Public Health. Panelist Frank Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard School of Public Health, explained that people who are sleep deprived tend to have less healthy diets than those who get enough sleep. Work by Hu and others has also linked sleep deprivation to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Dr. Lucian Leape, an internationally recognized leader of the patient safety movement, described the slowly dawning realization that sleep deprivation among doctors contributes to errors in medical care. A fourth panelist, Dr. Susan Redline, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, called sleep a complex neurophysiologic process that enhances learning and memory and restores and rejuvenates the brains. Unfortunately, at least 30% of adults and 70% of adolescents dont get enough sleep at night. Sleep deprivation doesnt just make us groggy. In adults, not getting enough sleep on a regular basis increases the chances of developing diabetes and heart disease. In children, it can lead to doing poorly in school, behavioral problems, prediabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure, said Redline. If you are interested in sleep and the long-lasting effects of not getting enough sleep, the Fighting the Clock Webcast is definitely worth watching. 
 Hello all. So here I am up at 1am writing this post, it has been commonplace for me for some time now where I usually don't fall asleep until 3-4 hours after I went to bed, and I was hoping you guys could offer some solutions to help me calm down at bed-time. What keeps me from falling asleep is two things: first is my old insomniphobia dating back to 2002, a condition where the more I feel like I'm not going to get sleep tonight the more anxiety builds up in me and keeps me from falling asleep, and the anxiety comes from the fear of being anxious and panicy all day the next day after no-sleep, anxious about 'will I not be able to sleep yet again tonight? I'm gonna lose my ability to function in life! It's gonna put me a non-stop panic attack like it did before!' That reason is well, fairly hopeless as I've conditioned my mind to think like that over many years, it's kind of like PTSD as those days of massive panic, sleepless nights, and trips to the ER have become a trauma in my mind. The second reason, and the thing I think you all could maybe help me with, is this OCD-like compulsion to have everything perfect when I'm trying to fall asleep. When I first lie in bed, everything has to feel right, my right sleeve of my shirt being too tight, the sheet not being perfectly aligned, and especially me feeling like I need a drink of water and needing to pee every few minutes (even though I always don't have much to pee), I'll even press on my bladder to see if there is any slight feeling that I have to pee and if there is, I get up and do it. Needless to say, with all of this moving and tossing and turning combined with the sleep anxiety, my body never gets a chance to settle down into sleep. Any suggestions on that, something that will help me to rid myself of these compulsions and OCD behavior at bedtime? Oh and FYI here are the sleep meds I take Xanax - 3mg Flexoril - 4 pills Lunesta - 3mg numerous pain relievers (and if I'm sick like I am now Benadryl 2-3 pills Delsym 3 tbs etc. Anyway, I'm gonna give it another go, please wish me luck. Ya know, I was just watching "Fight Club" and saw at the beginning how the guy sees a doctor for his insomnia but the doctor refuses to give him any meds and says 'what you need is healthy natural sleep', I've been in that situation before, and man that was harsh. Thanks all Sinex night 3 pills 
 Why Do We Dream? And How Do We Do It? by Robin Fox, Psychology Today March 7, 2012 What is dreaming for? How does it work? 89828-85956.jpg We spend a third of our lives asleep and most of that dreaming. Why do we dream? In The Tribal Imagination, I was discussing the role of rhyme in verse, its history and its biology. This led to the following discussion of dreams, brains, evolution, rhymes, concepts, metaphor, meter and memory. Flashback to the hominid brain and its evolution of lateralization: the division of functions between the hemispheres: the most amazing development since the origin of the brain itself. Words that rhyme are processed in the left hemisphere of the brain, the home of language, linearity and analysis. The pattern of a rhyme scheme, its chunkiness, is detected by the right hemisphere, the home of wholeness, of gestalt. The confluence of the two unites the hemispheres (via the corpus callosum) and drives the whole brain, including the emotional functions of the limbic system and the arousal of the pleasure centers and their opioids. When linked to metrical rhythm it involves the movement-control activities of the cerebellum and the motor cortex. Literacy and rhyme together change the brain; they set up new neuronal patterns, but patterns that tap into the most basic of that organ's basic processes. Memory was the mother of the muses, and so a major function of the meter-rhyme combination is mnemonic. I have described elsewhere, following the neglected but path-breaking work of Jonathan Winson (Brain and Psyche) the chemical process by which language (along with all other experience) is first stored in the cyngulate gyrus, in preparation for processing into memory. During Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, or "dreaming" as we know it. This chemical material, along with other "day residue" (Freud's term) is passed through the hippocampus where "neuronal gates" progressively release it to circulate through the limbic system, the old-mammalian emotional center of the brain. We cannot remember everything. Memory has to be selective, but on what principle? For any material, including concepts couched in language, to get into long-term memory, the dreaming brain must first translate it into images so that it can be emotionally "vetted." This is done by input from the emotional brain, especially the amygdala but also the septum and the cerebellum, and then it is transmitted back to the frontal lobes for storage, via the hypothalamus and the thalamus. This happens about four times a night, and deeper levels of retrieving and processing are reached and then recede as the REM dream-sleep continues. Memory is older than language; it worked entirely on images before language came along, very late in primate/hominid evolution. In consequence words must be accompanied by, or be converted into, images, in order to enter memory. Primate dreaming had accommodated sound, but words are more than sound: they are concepts and categories; they have meaning. Dreams are always visual; there is no such thing as a purely linguistic dreamsound without symbol. Metaphor and simile are two basic ways to provide the memory with ready-made images and symbols, and must have been there in the Ur-language of mankind, which was probably closer to poetry than prose, as Vico proposed in the eighteenth century. But, as Winson insists, "abstract concepts arising with language... can only be integrated into our unconscious brain mechanism by translation into visual scenes and action." Thus concepts must become images before they can be lodged in long-term memory. Some of the strangeness of dreams is a result of this conversion process, this "need for representability" as Freud called it. It also explains why our concepts and categories like Time for example, are not simply abstract and logical but are loaded with emotion. Time is an old father, with tide it waits for no man, it marches on, there is a nick of time, we beat time, we mark time, we keep time, we spend time, we waste time, and if we commit a crime, we do time, perhaps until our time is up. The "stamping in" to long-term memory takes about three years, studies of memory loss have shown. During this stamping-in process the human brain compares incoming material with already-stored experience and not just with basic instincts as in the "theta rhythm" of other mammals, exemplified when your dog twitches in his sleep in pursuit of phantom rabbits. This may be one huge and crucial exception to the rule that we do not lose anything in evolution. The human loss of theta rhythms (starting with the mammals: the monotremes have large brains but don't dream) may have been one of the most liberating developments in our evolutionary history. It released memory from instinct so that memory could build directly on memory itself. The brain then stores only that which meets the test of emotional appropriateness. That is, it stores material seen as relevant to stored experiencea lot of this being experience from early childhood, and therefore retained. Charles Dickens understood this uncannily well. Pip asks Estella in the movie of Great Expectations if she remembers making him cry as boy. She tells him no, and adds that he meant nothing to her so why should she remember? She says: "You know Pip I have no heart. Perhaps that is why I have no memory." I have in the past used the example of totemic categories and their instillation during the initiation ceremonies of young men, to make the point. The rules of the totem clan or moiety marriage and exogamy for example,) perhaps the most archaic of social rules, are concepts that are most effectively learned as dramatic imagessnake, bear, wolf, eagle, raven, crow, coyote, emu, and the legends associated with them. These are instilled into the boys' during often-painful and dramatic rituals over a long period, and dreamed into memory. In fact we learn better from trauma than normality, and male rats seem to learn more from "inescapable stress" than female rats. The actual process is complicated and the reader must look to the details in The Red Lamp of Incest and The Search for Society, and to the theory proposed by Francis Crick and Graeme Mitchison (at the much the same time as Winson) that dreaming is an aid to selective forgetting. But despite the complexities, the general point about meter, rhyme and memory is obvious. Rhyme schemes are compressed and powerful images like "death/breath""womb/tomb/doom""lust-thrust-dust." Every rhyme scheme is a little metaphor; every poem is a little ritual. Ted Hughes, in his book on Shakespeare's "ritual drama" sees metaphor as a result of the brief perfect combination of left and right hemisphere interaction that produces a momentary "convulsive expansion of awareness." So rhymes, added to the power of meter, and embodied in the "heightened reality" of metaphors, are a ready-made system of images for the dreaming brain to work on in its task of vetting the emotional appropriateness of potential memories. It is not then just that rhyme helps memory; rhyme is part of the metaphorical process of memorizing itself.

 Gettng the Sleep You Need: Tips for a Better Night's Rest Blogging Behavioral October 8, 2010 Getting a good night's sleep is an integral part of mental health. When we get too few hours of sleep or wake up feeling as though we haven't had enough rest, especially on a regular basis, our emotional and physical wellbeing can suffer dramatically. Many people come into therapy with sleep problems as one of their main symptoms. So it is fairly common to spend therapy time looking at a patient's sleep habits. Below are many changes and sleep hygiene tips often recommended to the sleep deprived. TIPS FOR BETTER DAYTIME HABITS Do not nap during the day - you will throw off your body clock and make it even more difficult to sleep at night. If you are feeling especially tired, and feel as if you absolutely must nap, be sure to sleep for less than 30 minutes, early in the day. Limit caffeine, alcohol and nicotine. Avoid drinking caffeine or alcoholic beverages for several hours before bedtime. Although alcohol may initially act as a sedative, it can interrupt normal sleep patterns. Nicotine is a stimulant and can make it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. Many over-the-counter and prescription drugs disrupt sleep, especially decongestants (examples: Sudafed, phenylpropanolamine). Expose yourself to bright light/sunlight soon after awakening. This will help to regulate your body's natural biological clock. Likewise, try to keep your bedroom dark while you are sleeping so that the light will not interfere with your rest. Exercise early in the day. Twenty to thirty minutes of exercise every day can help you sleep, but be sure to exercise in the morning or afternoon. Exercise stimulates the body and aerobic activity before bedtime may make falling asleep more difficult. Check your iron level. Iron deficient women tend to have more problems sleeping, so if your blood is iron poor, a supplement might help your health and your ability to sleep. TIPS FOR A BETTER PLACE TO SLEEP Keep your bedroom peaceful and comfortable. Make sure your room is well ventilated and the temperature consistent. And try to keep it quiet. You could use a fan or a "white noise" machine to help block outside noises. Your bed. Make sure your bed is large enough, and comfortable. If you are disturbed by a restless bedmate, switch to a queen- or king-size bed. Test different types of mattresses. Try therapeutic shaped foam pillows that cradle your neck or extra pillows that help you sleep on your side. Get comfortable cotton sheets. Your bedroom. Make your bedroom primarily a place for sleeping. It is not a good idea to use your bed for paying bills, doing work, watching tv, etc. Help your body recognize that this is a place for rest or intimacy. Your clock. Hide it. A big, illuminated digital clock may lead you to watch the time. You end up feeling stressed and anxious worrying about how many hours sleep you will, or will not, get. Place your clock so you can't see the time when you are in bed. TIPS FOR A BETTER PRE-SLEEP RITUAL Keep a regular schedule. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday, even on the weekends. This will help your body expect sleep at the same time each day. Dont oversleep to make up for a poor nights sleep  doing that for even a couple of days can reset your body clock and make it hard for you to get to sleep at night. Turn down the lighting in the evening. The closer you are to bedtime, avoid bright or blinking lights. Late night internet browsing is a big cause of insomnia. If you must use the computer at night, turn down the contrast button on your monitor. The television and video games are other sources of blinking lights that disrupt your body's ability to move toward sleep mode. Relax for a while before going to bed. Spending quiet time can make falling asleep easier. This may include meditation, relaxation and/or breathing exercises, or taking a warm bath. Try listening to recorded relaxation or guided imagery programs. Incorporate bedtime rituals. Establish a routine. Turn down the lights, listen to soft music, sip a cup of herbal tea (caffeine free), put on PJ's, brush teeth, wash face, etc., A routine cues your body that it's time to slow down and begin to prepare for sleep. Dont eat a large, heavy meal before bed. This can cause indigestion and interfere with your normal sleep cycle. Try to eat your dinner at least two hours before bedtime. Light bedtime snacks can help. An amino acid called tryptophan, found in milk, turkey, and peanuts, helps the brain produce serotonin, a chemical that helps you relax. Try drinking warm milk or eating a slice of toast with peanut butter or a bowl of cereal before bedtime. Plus, the warmth of the food may temporarily increase your body temperature and the subsequent drop may hasten sleep. Light carbohydrates can help. Crackers in bed, anyone? Jot down your concerns and worries. Anxiety excites the nervous system, so your brain sends messages to the adrenal glands, making you more alert. Write down your worries and possible solutions before you go to bed, so you don't need to ruminate in the middle of the night. A journal or "to do" list may be very helpful in letting you put away these concerns until the next day when you are fresh. Go to sleep when you are sleepy. When you feel tired, go to bed. Avoid "over-the-counter" sleep aids, and make sure that your prescribed medications do not cause insomnia. There is little evidence that supplements and other over-the-counter "sleep aids" are effective. In some cases, there are safety concerns. Antihistamine sleep aids, in particular, have a long duration of action and can cause daytime drowsiness. Always talk to your doctor or healthcare practitioner about your concerns. TIPS FOR GETTING BACK TO SLEEP Try visualization. Focus all your attention on your toes or visualize walking down an endless stairwell. Imagine yourself in your favorite vacation spot. Use all your senses: imagine what you can see, feel, taste, smell, and touch. Thinking about repetitive or mindless things will help your brain to shut down and adjust to sleep. Try deep relaxation. Focus on full inhales followed by emptying exhales. Repeat calming statements upon exhales, such as, I feel peaceful or I am floating. Make up your own. Get out of bed if unable to sleep. Dont lie in bed awake. Go into another room and do something relaxing until you feel sleepy. Worrying about falling asleep actually keeps many people awake. Don't do anything stimulating. Don't read anything job-related or watch a stimulating TV program (commercials and news shows tend to be alerting). Don't expose yourself to bright light. The light gives cues to your brain that it is time to wake up. Get up and eat some turkey. Turkey contains tryptophan, a major building block for making serotonin, a neurotransmitter, which sends messages between nerve cells and causes feelings of sleepiness. Note that L-tryptophan doesn't act on the brain unless you eat it on an empty stomach with no protein present, so keep some turkey in the refrigerator for 3am. Consider changing your bedtime. If you are experiencing sleeplessness or insomnia consistently, think about going to bed later so that the time you spend in bed is spent sleeping. If you are only getting five hours of sleep at night, figure out what time you need to get up and subtract five hours (for example, if you want to get up at 6:00 am, go to bed at 1:00 am). This may seem counterproductive and, at first, you may be depriving yourself of some sleep, but it can help train your body to sleep consistently while in bed. When you are spending all of your time in bed sleeping, you can gradually sleep more, by adding 15 minutes at a time. 
 Sleep Paralysis and the Supernatural: Terror and apparitions in the night by Michael Otto, Ph.D., Psychology Today December 15, 2011 You awake suddenly at night. You try to rise, but feel hands pressing down on your chest, groping for your throat. You try to cry out, but you cannot move or speak. You notice a shadowy figure at the foot of the bed, and hear the steady clomp, clomp, clomp of others climbing the stairs to your room. Your terror grows, but then as suddenly as it began, the pressure releases and the presence in the room fades into nothingness. You can now move, rise from the bed, and try to make sense of what just happened to you. You have just had an episode of sleep paralysis. Normally, when you dream, you are paralyzed. This is handy, because without this you would regularly act out your dreams. In sleep paralysis, however, the normal cycles of your sleep become out of sync: your mind wakes up, but your body is still in a dream state. You are aware of your surroundings, but cannot move and may also experience any number of hallucinations. Most commonly, these hallucinations include sensing the presence of others (including seeing shadowy figures), feeling external pressure on the chest, hearing odd knocking sounds, seeing your body as if from the outside, or experiencing vibrating or tingling sensations. Any single episode of sleep paralysis may include one or more of these hallucinatory symptoms. Between 6 and 17 percent of the general adult population experience sleep paralysis at some point in their life and it is even more common among certain groups. For example, higher rates are reported among college students (near 30%). This might be because of the common sleep disruptions that college students experience (all that late night studying, no doubt); sleep paralysis occurs more often following sleep disturbances. Overall, sleep paralysis is normal, and comes with a good scientific explanation. Yet, the experience of sleep paralysis can be terrifying, particularly when a person does not understand what is going on. And without a good explanation, many will search for a more supernatural explanation for their harrowing experience. The odd knocking sounds could be the sound of a machine or someone climbing stairs or knocking at the door. The sense or vision of a presence and the feelings of chest pressure can be taken for a ghost, demon, or alien leaning over and pressing on the chest or throat, or sitting directly on the chest. The particular kind of supernatural explanation for these symptoms often depends on a person's culture. In Japan, these experiences may be known as a kanashibari attack. In Newfoundland, it might be interpreted as the action of the "old Hag" sitting on the chest, or in the West Indies the attacking spirit is known as Kokma. A web search of any of these terms will reveal strikingly similar accounts of the symptoms of sleep paralysis. Also included among the interpretations of sleep paralysis is an account that has been particularly endemic to the United States - alien abduction. Think of the symptoms of sleep paralysis: a sense of one or more beings lurking over the bed, feeling held down by some power, feeling electrical vibrations or sensation of numbness or floating, and of course the paralysis and feelings of fear. Then, just as suddenly as they appeared, these images and sensations fade, and one is left alone in bed, trying to make sense of what happened. It sounds a lot like a Spielberg movie to me. And it is easy to see that in trying to explain this experience some may turn to ghostly hauntings, some to angelic apparitions, some to worries about neurological disease, and some to alien visitation. Some will come to these interpretations on their own, and some will be given an explanatory context by the media or the web, or friends or family. Still others will just pass off the experience as a random weird event. Hence, there are two parts to the sleep paralysis experience: (1) the immediate experience of symptoms, and (2) the potentially long-term change in beliefs about the world that result from interpretations of that event. Understanding the symptoms of sleep paralysis, and knowing that they need not be interpreted as a sign of the supernatural (for good or for evil), can help keep temporary symptoms from becoming a life-altering event.

 The Effects of Alcohol on Sleep January 28, 2005 Question: What are the effects of alcohol on sleep? Response from Karl Doghramji, MD Professor of Psychiatry, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Director, Sleep Disorders Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Alcohol is used extensively as a sleep aid in the general population. In a recent survey[1], 28% of insomniacs indicated that they had used alcohol to help them fall asleep. Occasional insomniacs used alcohol for an average of 3.6 nights/month, while chronic insomniacs used alcohol for an average of 6.8 nights/month. An equal number of occasional insomniacs and chronic insomniacs (67%) described alcohol as an effective or very effective method to induce sleep. When ingested by normal individuals, alcohol leads to a more rapid induction of sleep. It also increases non-REM sleep and reduces REM sleep during the first portion of the night. However, alcohol is metabolized rapidly and blood concentrations are negligible by the middle of the night for most individuals who have a few drinks prior to bedtime, often resulting in withdrawal symptoms thereafter. These may include shallow sleep and multiple awakenings, REM rebound associated with nightmares or vivid dreams, sweating, and general activation[2,3]. Therefore, although alcohol may be effective in sleep induction, it impairs sleep during the second half of the night and can lead to a reduction in overall sleep time. As a result, it can also be associated with daytime somnolence. It is of interest that alcohol's negative effects on sleep are even observed when it is ingested in the late afternoon. Insomnia is often a chronic condition, and chronic reliance on alcohol increases the risk of development of alcohol dependence and alcoholism. Alcoholism itself is also associated with the complaints of poor sleep characterized by prolonged time to fall asleep, multiple awakenings, and decreased delta and REM sleep.[4] Sleep changes can persist during months or years of abstinence, and recent studies indicate that certain alterations in sleep architecture, as well as subjective sleep complaints, predict relapse to alcoholism.[5] A variety of sleep disorders can be responsible for insomnia; these include sleep-related breathing disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Alcohol increases the severity of the syndrome, and may cause snoring and induce apneas in individuals without a history of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome[6]. In conclusion, alcohol is a commonly used substance for sleep induction. However, it is a poor choice as a hypnotic because it can disrupt sleep even further, may lead to alcohol dependence and alcoholism, and may intensify sleep-related breathing disturbances.

 Exercise Can Aid Sleep and Productivity By Rick Nauert PhD, PsychCentral News November 23, 2011 Researchers have found people sleep significantly better and feel more alert during the day if they get at least 150 minutes of exercise a week. Investigators reviewed a sample of more than 2,600 men and women, ages 18-85. They discovered 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity a week, which is the national guideline, provided a 65 percent improvement in sleep quality. The physically active also reported less drowsiness during the day, compared to individuals with less physical activity. Researchers said the findings add to the mounting evidence of exercise benefiting physical and mental health. The study will be published in the December issue of the journal Mental Health and Physical Activity. Among adults in the United States, about 35 to 40 percent of the population has problems with falling asleep or with daytime sleepiness. We were using the physical activity guidelines set forth for cardiovascular health, but it appears that those guidelines might have a spillover effect to other areas of health, said Brad Cardinal, Ph.D., one of the studys authors. Increasingly, the scientific evidence is encouraging as regular physical activity may serve as a non-pharmaceutical alternative to improve sleep. After controlling for age, BMI (Body Mass Index), health status, smoking status, and depression, the relative risk of often feeling overly sleepy during the day compared to never feeling overly sleepy during the day decreased by 65 percent for participants meeting physical activity guidelines. Similar results were also found for having leg cramps while sleeping (68 percent less likely) and having difficulty concentrating when tired (45 percent decrease). Our findings demonstrate a link between regular physical activity and perceptions of sleepiness during the day, which suggests that participation in physical activity on a regular basis may positively influence an individuals productivity at work, or in the case of a student, influence their ability to pay attention in class, said Paul Loprinzi, doctoral student and lead author of the study. Physical activity may not just be good for the waistline and heart, but it also can help you sleep, Cardinal said. There are trade-offs. It may be easier when you are tired to skip the workout and go to sleep, but it may be beneficial for your long-term health to make the hard decision and get your exercise. Source: Study: Physical activity impacts overall quality of sleep | News & Research Communications | Oregon State University 
 I have been trying to find out what the physical and mental/emotional effects of severe (max 4 hours of broken sleep), prolonged (10 months and counting) inomnia are, but so far not much luck ... mostly comments about how it can be dangerous because a person becomes less alert (duh) ... so I'm hoping someone here would be able - and willing - to either give me some idea, or point me in the direction of reliable and relevant information.

 Restless Legs Syndrome Linked to Hypertension in Women by Steve Stiles, Medscape October 13, 2011 Hypertension was significantly more prevalent among women who reported frequent symptoms of restless-legs syndrome (RLS)--that is, symptoms at least 15 times per month--compared with those who said they had them less often or not at all, according to a cross-sectional cut of data from the Women's Health Study 2 (WHS 2) [1]. The observed association between RLS and hypertension, which was independent of recognized hypertension risk factors, applied to both systolic and diastolic pressures and became stronger with increasing RLS severity, report the authors, led by Dr Salma Batool-Anwar (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). The group's findings "are consistent with the previous literature suggesting a possible role for RLS in the pathogenesis of hypertension," they state in their report, published online October 10, 2011 in Hypertension. They caution against generalizing their results to men, although some of the prior research suggests the two conditions may be linked in both men and women. In particular, the group points to research suggesting that 80% of people with RLS (characterized by "intense, unpleasant leg sensations and an irresistible urge to move the legs") also show periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS). And PLMS, they note, is associated with periodic fluctuations in blood pressure. "What appears to be a common theme between RLS and PLMS [regular limb movements during sleep] is that such leg movements are associated with sympathetically mediated elevations in both heart rate and blood pressure," write Drs Domenic Sica and David Leszczyszyn (Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA) in an accompanying editorial [2]. "A not-unreasonable hypothesis derived from these events is that the repeated overnight changes in blood pressure developing during nighttime RLS and PLMS episodes increase daytime blood pressure based on the cumulative effects of increased nocturnal sympathetic activity," they write. Still, whether RLS is one cause of hypertension can't be determined from a cross-sectional study, Batool-Anwar noted for heartwire. It could be that RLS and hypertension simply share a common pathophysiology. But their analysis excluded women with conditions that might mimic RLS, including diabetics (who could have peripheral neuropathy), and RLS severity went up with hypertension prevalence, so the findings "point in the direction" of causation, she said. The analysis included 65 544 women from the WHS 2 cohort who were given a probable diagnosis of RLS based on questionnaire responses; the diagnosis required that RLS symptoms occur at least five times per month. Excluded were any who were diabetic, currently had arthritis, or were pregnant. Overall, the age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for hypertension was 1.43 (95% CI 1.331.53, p<0.0001) among the women with RLS symptoms compared with those without symptoms; the significant relationship "did not materially change" (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.101.30) after further adjustments for conditions with possible ties to RLS. There was a positive relationship between degree of RLS symptoms and hypertension prevalence.

"Also a healthy lifestyle: [controlling] intake of caffeine and alcohol and [reducing] weight." And if that doesn't help, drug therapy is available. But Sica and Leszczyszyn also emphasize that the findings "are observational and cannot in any way be viewed as being mechanistic; thus, no insight can be provided into whether treatment of RLS could in any sort of meaningful way lower blood pressure." Besides, they note, "the magnitude of blood-pressure change in millimeters of mercury was very small, even in those with the highest frequency of RLS, such that even the best clinician would not have identified a blood-pressure change attributed to RLS."

 Well, after a month I had to go back on my sleeping pills. I'm only taking a half-dose so I'm hoping it will be easy when I try to wean off them yet again. Anyone else have an on-off relationship with sleeping meds? I'm under a ridiculous, ridiculous amount of stress right now so I'm thinking that's why I need them, and hoping that when all this blows over at the end of the month I might be able to wean off them again . Either that, or I guess I'm a lifer . 
 College freshmen face sleep problems, education helps Shrink Rap Auguyst 30, 2011 Sleep-poster.jpg A campus media campaign at the University of ArizonaTucson was effectivein raising sleep as a health issue and in getting students to sleep better and longer. Credit: University of Arizona Sleep often suffers in a students freshman year, but a new study finds that young college students may think their sleep quality is better than it is. The study also demonstrates that a low-cost campus wide media campaign can help some students sleep better and suggests that discussing sleep problems may be a gateway for college health providers to address more sensitive problems. When Kathryn Orzech attended the College of William and Mary in Virginia, she participated in drama and choir. Rehearsals that would have ended at 10 p.m. in high school now went much later. Social opportunities around the dorm  card games, trips to late-night snack hangout spots  beckoned but without parents around to wield the cudgel of a curfew. For a long list of reasons, college freshmen are often sub-par sleepers. A new study by Orzech, now a postdoctoral fellow in sleep research at Brown University, and student health officials at the University of Arizona, illuminates some of the factors undermining sleep. The research published in the current issue of the Journal of American College Health also indicates that college students think their sleep is better than it is and that a campus wide media intervention costing less than $2,500 was able to help nearly 10 percent of students find ways to sleep better.

 The very, very strange properties of REM sleepby Patrick McNamara, Psychology Today August 13, 2011 REM paralyzes, then sexually activates you before producing the dream Most cognitive products of the Mind are produced by relatively straightforward activation/de-activation patterns in widely distributed neural networks of the brain. When for example, a highly complex cognitive product like a sentence or a story is produced by your mind, it generally is associated with those particular brain activation/de-activation patterns as well as mild emotional changes in your psyche and mild arousal levels in your body. Not so with dreams. Dreams are highly complex cognitive products that are produced, as far as we can tell, by Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. While REM sleep is also composed of a series of particular brain activation/de-activation patterns, bodily and emotional arousal patterns are anything but mild. Relative to the waking state, sympathetic nervous system activity rises dramatically during phasic portions of REM. As the average duration of REM episodes increase over the course of the night, so do the durations of sympathetic discharges giving rise to periodic REM-related sympathetic discharges or "storms." These autonomic nervous system (ANS) storms, in turn, may be linked to a host of negative cardiopulmonary changes that occur during REM. During all REM periods, an acceleration of heart rate occurs at least 10 beats before EEG signs of phasic arousal, and then fluctuates dramatically during phasic REM. Systemic arterial blood pressure (BP), pulmonary BP, and intracranial arterial BP all exhibit increased variability relative to NREM and waking levels. Because of the hemodynamic, ANS, and sympathetic alterations of REM, plaque rupture and coronary arterial spasm become more likely. Persons with cardiopulmonary disease are indeed more likely to die during this REM period than at any other time of the 24-hour day. In addition, during REM oxygen desaturation levels are maximal and Cheyne-Stokes-like breathing patterns predominate. As a result of the fall in alveolar ventilation, there are changes in blood gas levels, with rises in CO2 and decreases in oxygen saturation. The natural response to lowered O2 levels is to increase inspiratory breathing, but this response (the hypoxic ventilatory response) is decreased by over 50% of normal capacity during REM. The REM-related hypoxemia and abnormal breathing patterns may cause life-threatening complications in vulnerable persons, including infants with immature lung capacity thus increasing the chance for sudden infant death syndrome. REM also appears to involve a loss of thermo-regulatory reflexes so that it is harder for the individual to stop heat loss during REM sleep. Although brain temperature rises during REM, thermoregulatory responses such as sweating and panting do not occur in REM. Yet another bizarre feature of REM is that phasic eye movements and muscle twitches occur upon a background of paralysis in the antigravity musculature, including the jaw, neck, and limbs. This paralysis however does not extend to the sexual organs! In males every REM period is associated with prolonged penile erections. These REM-related erections apparently even occur in infants. They persist throughout the lifespan but are not reliably associated with erotic desire. Women sometimes undergo uterine contractions and pelvic thrusting during REM, but too few studies have been done on this topic to draw any firm conclusions. In short whenever we go into REM sleep we experience intense ANS storms, cardiovascular instabilities, respiratory impairment, thermoregulatory lapses, muscle twitching, muscle paralysis and penile erections. Now recall that the cognitive products associated with this strange set of physiologic aberrations are what we call dreams. Is it any wonder that theorists of REM sleep have despaired of ever identifying the evolutionary or physiologic functions of REM sleep? 
 I have to take hypnotics in order to sleep. I've been on them for about 4 years now. I don't always dream, but when I do it's seldom pleasant. I'm always being attacked. Obviously I don't remember a lot of it. But, I do always remember being under attack. I'm always being killed or injured in my dreams. The last one that I remember was so vivid and frightening. I was on a beach. It was in Haiti, I think. I've been there before and I can still remember how the sand felt on my feet. Fine like talcum powder. But very hot. The surf came in suddenly and I was dragged out into open water and left clinging to a picnic table, barely floating on the surface. I could taste the salt in the water. There was a shark in the water. A huge, white shark. Like the ones in movies. Big enough to swallow a man whole. I woke up laying prone on my knees and elbows, clinging to my bed. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? What does it mean to have such violent experiences? I already know that I'm insane. But, there must be something that I can do. I can't go on like this. I scare the hell out of people when I wake up. It's come to the point where I'm isolating myself whenever I go to sleep. 
 This has been an issue for about a year now, but the underlying issues date way back to childhood. I'm in this situation, where I'm stuck in a sleep pattern that is generally going to bed a 4am and waking up at 2pm (I have evening classes at the university). It's become a problem because most of the day is gone by the time I wake up and get dressed and all. It contributes to my depression as well, because the hours between 1am and 4am are very lonely hours during the weekdays, if I'm stressed or panicing, who do I call? So I'm utterly alone and that is really devistating to me. To understand the problem, I should mention that I am a full-on insomniphobe. The techinical term is psychophysiological insomnia, but many previous occurances of lying in bed scared to death about whether I will fall asleep or not (which elevates my heart rate, and in turn makes it so I don't fall asleep to begin with). I know this sounds silly to some people, that I would be panic-stricken if I don't fall asleep, but it is very real to me, as in numerous situations in the past I experienced a cascading anxiety effect upon the very thought of 'will I not be able to sleep tonight?', in the past I have had experiences where I was awake for 3 days straight because each time my head hit the pillow, my heart would start racing and next thing I know I'm in a panic attack (which keeps me from sleeping), I would dread even seeing my bed, because the very experience of panic is utterly devestating and I fear a repeat. If you imagne this... it's 3am on a weekday, I need to go to bed for some early, very important chores the next day... anxiety starts building up as I come closer to bedtime, I down my handful of medications (including 3mg lunesta, 2mg xanax, 1kmg Ibprofen, 2 Roboxin, 3 cyclobenzaprine (those are muscle relaxents), and 2 prazosin (for nightmeres)), I go to bed, nearly shaking as I enter the bed, I try to distract my mind with stories or memories but the thought keep coming back to me: "will I not be able to sleep tonight and experience a night stricket with awful panic attacks and I'll be 'crippled' the next day due to lack of sleep, and during the day continue to panic especially as the next bed time comes around?" With that in my mind, I get out of bed and start pacing, panicing.... is there anyone to call for help? No, it's 5am on a weekday, I'm alone in this. That's the fear, thats the phobia, as irrational as it sounds, it exists in me. So, sorry that was a bit long, but to help me wtih this problem you need to know that background. I want to shift from going to bed at 4am to 1:30am during this spring break. I want to do this because for one I feel I would be able to 'get more out of my day' instead of spending 3-4 hours in soluitude in the wee hours of 1am-4am when most have gone to sleep. I want to be able to get out in the sunshine and enjoy activities with friends, not get up at 3pm and realize all my friends and family have already made plans and the sun is almost gonna go down. This is all also compounded by the fact that I am afraid of sleep because I get some horrific nightmeres, mostly PTSD related, disturbing dreams from the Afgan war and all that. Now, the problem is that when I go to bed earlier than usual, it triggers that anxiety I spoke about ealrier, and often despite going to bed earlier, I still toss and turn until I fall asleep at the regular time (for me), 4 or 5am. I've tried that numerous times and it worked out just like that. So I'm trying to find a solution for this. My idea is that over spring break I will decrease what time I go to bed by 30 minutes each day, until Saturday when hopefully my bed time will be 1:30am. My concern is that the 30 minutes, even, will once again trigger that anxiety avalanche (as I call it), and once again I'll toss and turn till 4am. I really want out of this rut. Any and all advise would be welcome. You can tell this is a very big issue for me just by the length of this post, I'm sure... lol. So please, any suggestions are welcome, and anyone who has experienced the same thing, I'd like to hear from you too. Thanks, Matt 
 Dreams of early childhood by Patrick McNamara in Psychology Today August 6, 2011 Our cultures decide how we construe dreams but kids resist Sometimes very young children, our 4 and 5 year old's, have experiences with us that we are not aware of! My four year old daughter, Ina, woke up the other morning and began asking me why I did x and why we did x and how come I did x when she did y and so forth. For the life of me I could not remember what events or episodes she was referring to and then it began to dawn on me that she was talking about dreams that she had had where she and I had played together or gone some place together. For her the dream was real and she assumed that I had experienced everything that she had experienced in her dream. Ina's four year old cousin Adam once told his mom that he was at the subway station and he fell down to the rails. The subway was coming and he could hardly escape. He believed for days that it had really happened to him and his mom had to do her best to convince him: it was only a dream. In short, very young children need to learn the difference between dream and reality and until they do they sometimes have experiences with and without us that we are not aware of! Now those two conclusions are very striking facts: that 1) children need to learn the difference between dream and reality and 2) that very young children have experiences with us that we are not aware of. With regard to number 2, that children believe dreams with their parents are real shared experiences with parents, I wonder how that fact influences child-parent relationships? If a 3 or 4 year old dreams that he and his mom went through a traumatic scary experience together does not that increase the trust the child has in his mom? Or conversely if a 3 or 4 year old daughter had dreamed that she and her Dad had played a game in a certain way in her dream should she not expect her Dad to remember the way they had played together in the dream? If the Dad does not remember this special game then should not the daughter get mad at the Dad and the Dad be bewildered by this reaction? With respect to number 1, that the child has to learn the difference between dream and reality, current data points to that difference being learned sometime between the ages of 3 and 5. Woolley and Boerger (2002), for example, showed a group of 3, 4 and 5 year olds pairs of pictures of characters sitting in chairs with their eyes closed. One sentence about each character was presented. For example, children were told, "Here's Suzi. She's trying to make a picture in her head." and "Here's Elaine. She just had a picture pop into her head." Then children were asked, "Which child is dreaming-Elaine or Suzi"? If the children responded "Elaine" the investigators assumed that the children were showing that they understood that dreams were involuntary products of the mind... Results in fact, showed that ‘Elaine'-level responses were most common among 5 year olds. Meyer and Shore (2001) performed similar experiments with children and in addition gave the children theory of mind tasks designed to assess level of understanding that mental states were private events, that we could not see what others were thinking and they others could not see what we were thinking and so forth. Theory of mind developments in 5 year olds were, in fact, correlated with children's understanding of the reality and the privacy of dreams. So at around 5 years old most children seem to learn that the adults around them construe ‘dreams' to be non-real psychological occurrences that they experience privately by themselves. In cultures where dreams are construed as real events in the world the 5 year old apparently just continues with his or her ‘default assumption' that dreams are real and shared experiences rather than non-real and private experiences. Thus, Mother Nature gives us a choice concerning the ontological weight that we as a culture assign to dreams and this decision concerning the meaning of dreams is so important to culture that the decision must be made by the time we are five! My daughter Ina and her cousin Adam both seem to have resisted the modern decision to treat dreams as private and non-real but alas they have little real choice in the matter. When all is said and done the regnant culture makes the decision for them. The kids can resist for a while and can even support one another in that resistance but eventually they have to accept the culture's definitions of what is real and meaningful if they hope to remain ‘in-step' with that culture as they ‘mature'. As Wordsworth in his Ode ‘Intimations of immortality from recollections of early childhood' once said: "There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream, The earth, and every common sight, To me did seem Apparell'd in celestial light, The glory and the freshness of a dream. 5 It is not now as it hath been of yore;- Turn wheresoe'er I may, By night or day, The things which I have seen I now can see no more."

 The Science Behind Dreaming By Sander van der Linden, Scientific American Tuesday, July 26, 2011 New research sheds light on how and why we remember dreams--and what purpose they are likely to serve For centuries people have pondered the meaning of dreams. Early civilizations thought of dreams as a medium between our earthly world and that of the gods. In fact, the Greeks and Romans were convinced that dreams had certain prophetic powers. While there has always been a great interest in the interpretation of human dreams, it wasnt until the end of the nineteenth century that Sigmund Freud​ and Carl Jung​ put forth some of the most widely-known modern theories of dreaming. Freuds theory centred around the notion of repressed longing -- the idea that dreaming allows us to sort through unresolved, repressed wishes. Carl Jung (who studied under Freud) also believed that dreams had psychological importance, but proposed different theories about their meaning. Since then, technological advancements have allowed for the development of other theories. One prominent neurobiological theory of dreaming is the activation-synthesis hypothesis, which states that dreams dont actually mean anything: they are merely electrical brain impulses that pull random thoughts and imagery from our memories. Humans, the theory goes, construct dream stories after they wake up, in a natural attempt to make sense of it all. Yet, given the vast documentation of realistic aspects to human dreaming as well as indirect experimental evidence that other mammals such as cats also dream, evolutionary psychologists have theorized that dreaming really does serve a purpose. In particular, the threat simulation theory suggests that dreaming should be seen as an ancient biological defence mechanism that provided an evolutionary advantage because of its capacity to repeatedly simulate potential threatening events  enhancing the neuro-cognitive mechanisms required for efficient threat perception and avoidance. So, over the years, numerous theories have been put forth in an attempt to illuminate the mystery behind human dreams, but, until recently, strong tangible evidence has remained largely elusive. Yet, new research published in the Journal of Neuroscience provides compelling insights into the mechanisms that underlie dreaming and the strong relationship our dreams have with our memories. Cristina Marzano and her colleagues at the University of Rome have succeeded, for the first time, in explaining how humans remember their dreams. The scientists predicted the likelihood of successful dream recall based on a signature pattern of brain waves. In order to do this, the Italian research team invited 65 students to spend two consecutive nights in their research laboratory. During the first night, the students were left to sleep, allowing them to get used to the sound-proofed and temperature-controlled rooms. During the second night the researchers measured the students brain waves while they slept. Our brain experiences four types of electrical brain waves: delta, theta, alpha, and beta. Each represents a different speed of oscillating electrical voltages and together they form the electroencephalography (EEG). The Italian research team used this technology to measure the participants brain waves during various sleep-stages. (There are five stages of sleep; most dreaming and our most intense dreams occur during the REM stage.) The students were woken at various times and asked to fill out a diary detailing whether or not they dreamt, how often they dreamt and whether they could remember the content of their dreams. While previous studies have already indicated that people are more likely to remember their dreams when woken directly after REM sleep, the current study explains why. Those participants who exhibited more low frequency theta waves in the frontal lobes were also more likely to remember their dreams. This finding is interesting because the increased frontal theta activity the researchers observed looks just like the successful encoding and retrieval of autobiographical memories seen while we are awake. That is, it is the same electrical oscillations in the frontal cortex that make the recollection of episodic memories (e.g., things that happened to you) possible. Thus, these findings suggest that the neurophysiological mechanisms that we employ while dreaming (and recalling dreams) are the same as when we construct and retrieve memories while we are awake. In another recent study conducted by the same research team, the authors used the latest MRI techniques to investigate the relation between dreaming and the role of deep-brain structures. In their study, the researchers found that vivid, bizarre and emotionally intense dreams (the dreams that people usually remember) are linked to parts of the amygdala and hippocampus. While the amygdala plays a primary role in the processing and memory of emotional reactions, the hippocampus has been implicated in important memory functions, such as the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory. The proposed link between our dreams and emotions is also highlighted in another recent study published by Matthew Walker and colleagues at the Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab at UC Berkeley, who found that a reduction in REM sleep (or less dreaming) influences our ability to understand complex emotions in daily life  an essential feature of human social functioning. Scientists have also recently identified where dreaming is likely to occur in the brain. A very rare clinical condition known as Charcot-Wilbrand Syndrome has been known to cause (among other neurological symptoms) loss of the ability to dream. However, it was not until a few years ago that a patient reported to have lost her ability to dream while having virtually no other permanent neurological symptoms. The patient suffered a lesion in a part of the brain known as the right inferior lingual gyrus (located in the visual cortex). Thus, we know that dreams are generated in, or transmitted through this particular area of the brain, which is associated with visual processing, emotion and visual memories. Taken together, these recent findings tell an important story about the underlying mechanism and possible purpose of dreaming. Dreams seem to help us process emotions by encoding and constructing memories of them. What we see and experience in our dreams might not necessarily be real, but the emotions attached to these experiences certainly are. Our dream stories essentially try to strip the emotion out of a certain experience by creating a memory of it. This way, the emotion itself is no longer active. This mechanism fulfils an important role because when we dont process our emotions, especially negative ones, this increases personal worry and anxiety. In fact, severe REM sleep-deprivation is increasingly correlated to the development of mental disorders. In short, dreams help regulate traffic on that fragile bridge which connects our experiences with our emotions and memories. 
 I'm just wondering if it's possible that you can be an insomniac forever. I know that's a big question, so let me break it down... I've been on prescription sleeping pills for a couple years now. I have to take them every night or I will not sleep. I've tried to wean off them a couple times without success. I've tried everything the experts say - no caffeine, no exercise, use my bed only for sleeping, deep breathing, comfortable room temperature, dark, quiet, regular schedule, etc. My body, it seems, refuses to sleep on its own. I can be absolutely exhausted, but the second my head hits the pillow I'm wide awake. I also have to be careful with my sleeping pills - they take about 45-60 minutes to make me drowsy, but if I don't go to bed in that window, I can "push past" the tired effect and stay up all night anyway. I found that out the hard way so now I take them at 11pm and go to bed at midnight (after Golden Girls heehee) so I have a schedule and can plan. Anyway - does anyone know if it's common to have insomnia for one's whole life? Or if it's not uncommon, is it unusual? I would like my body to learn to sleep on its own again, but if it's not harmful and not uncommon, I will resign myself to a life of sleeping pills. And I guess it's not technically my "whole" life, cause it only hit around age 31 . 
 Sleep aids: Could antihistamines help me sleep? By Mayo Clinic staff Is it OK to use over-the-counter antihistamines to treat insomnia? I'd like to avoid prescription sleep aids. Answer from Timothy Morgenthaler, M.D. Antihistamines can cause drowsiness, which may help you fall asleep for a few nights  but routine use of antihistamines for insomnia isn't recommended. Antihistamines induce drowsiness by working against histamine, a chemical produced by the central nervous system. In fact, most over-the-counter sleep aids contain antihistamines. These products are intended to be used for only two to three nights at a time, however, such as when stress, travel or other disruptions keep you awake. Tolerance to the sedative effects of antihistamines can develop quickly  so the longer you take them, the less likely they are to make you sleepy. Side effects may include daytime drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness and memory problems. If you're struggling with chronic insomnia, don't rely on antihistamines or other over-the-counter sleep aids for a good night's sleep. Lifestyle changes  rather than sleep aids  are usually the best approach. Start with the basics, such as: Following a regular sleep scheduleAvoiding caffeine and daytime napsIncluding physical activity in your daily routineManaging stress If you continue to have trouble falling or staying asleep, consult your doctor. In addition to lifestyle changes, your doctor may recommend behavior therapy to help you learn new sleep habits and ways to make your sleeping environment more conducive to sleep. In some cases, short-term use of prescription sleep aids may be recommended as well. 
 Who's up, doc? Journal issues wake-up call to sleep-deprived MDs By Sharon Kirkey, Ottawa Citizen May 24, 2011 Physicians need to give up the idea that working long hours on call is something to be proud of, says a new editorial in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. National standards are needed to protect patients from doctors so sleep starved they might as well be legally impaired, Canada's leading medical journal says. Studies have found a near doubling in the rate of complications  including massive hemorrhage or organ injury  when surgeons operate with fewer than six hours of sleep after a night on call. The problem of sleep-deprived physicians is poised to only get worse, states an editorial published in this week's issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal. Medical care is more complex than ever, placing "unprecedented" demands on a doctor's physical and cognitive wherewithal. Physicians need to give up the idea that long stretches on call should be worn like a badge of honour, the authors state. Instead, a culture shift is needed. Working while sleep deprived is neither "normal nor acceptable," the authors write, adding: "Those of us who remain overconfident that we can continue to perform our duties properly with inadequate sleep should imagine the reaction if we were made to seek informed consent from each of our patients to accept treatment under these conditions." Limits have been imposed on how long residents and medical students can go without sleep. But, for practising doctors, there are virtually none, the authors of the editorial say  even though practising doctors are older and probably even more vulnerable to the effects of sleep loss. What's more, unlike doctors-in-training, fully trained doctors usually have no one looking over their shoulder "to catch their mistakes." In understaffed community hospitals, doctors can work days in a row with minimal backup and sleep, says Dr. Paul Hebert, the journal's editor-in-chief and a critical-care doctor at The Ottawa Hospital. But even in big city hospitals doctors frequently work "long, long hours, and often on call, and the next day still do clinics," Hebert said. It's difficult to make hard and fast rules, he says. Several of his colleagues sleep, on average, four hours a night "and they function just fine." Others can become completely dysfunctional. "The things that go first are executive function and judgment," Hebert said in an interview. "Your co-ordination starts to be impaired after having less than a few hours sleep a night." But, "a lot of us were trained in a bit of a macho culture, where it's kind of like, 'I can do it.'" Strategies are needed to restrict how long doctors can work without sleep, the journal says, including strict policies on going home after being on call, not scheduling cases the day following a night on call and shifting resources between hospitals to provide backup to under-serviced communities. "Ultimately, licensing, accreditation, insurance and government institutions need to establish minimum best-practice standards for maximum work and minimum uninterrupted sleep hours." A 2009 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association involving post nighttime procedures found an 83 per cent greater risk of complications when surgeons had less than six hours' sleep. An editorial published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine argued that sleep-deprived doctors shouldn't be allowed to operate without a patient's written, informed consent. Says Hebert, "If you had to get consent from every patient, maybe the system would change." According to the CMAJ, less than six hours of uninterrupted sleep from overnight calls impairs a doctor's judgment and motor performance similar to a blood-alcohol level above 0.05 per cent. 
 Is Your Brain Sleeping While You're Awake? by Christine Dell'Amore, National Geographic April 27, 2011 Key parts of sleep-deprived brains may go offline, hindering decision-making. If you think you can function on minimal sleep, here's a wake-up call: Parts of your brain may doze off even if you're totally awake, according to a new study in rats. Scientists observed the electrical activity of brains in rats forced to stay up longer than usual. Problem-solving brain regions fell into a kind of "local sleep"a condition likely in sleep-deprived humans too, the study authors say. Surprisingly, when sections of the rats' brains entered these sleeplike states, "you couldn't tell that [the rats] are in any way in a different state of wakefulness," said study co-author Giulio Tononi, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Despite these periods of local sleep, overall brain activityand the rats behaviorssuggested the animals were fully awake. This phenomenon of local sleep is "not just an interesting observation of unknown significance," Tononi said. It "actually affects behavioryou make a mistake." For example, when the scientists had the rats perform a challenging taskusing their paws to reach sugar pelletsthe sleep-deprived animals had trouble completing it. Sleep Allows Neurons to Reset? Tononi and colleagues recorded the electrical activity of lab rats via electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors connected to the rodents' heads. As predicted, when the rats were awake, their neuronsnerve cells that collect and transmit signals in the brainfired frequently and irregularly. When the animals slept, their neurons fired less often, usually in a regular up-and-down pattern that manifests on the EEG as a "slow wave." Called non-rapid eye movement, this sleep stage accounts for about 80 percent of all sleep in both rats and people. The researchers used toys to distract the rats into staying awake for a few hoursnormally "rats take lots of siestas," Tononi noted. The team discovered that neurons in two sections of these overtired rats' cerebral cortexes entered a slow-wave stage that is essentially sleep. Why Do We Sleep? It's unknown why parts of an awake brain nod off, though it may have something to do with why mammals sleepstill an open question, said Tononi, whose study appears tomorrow in the journal Nature. According to one leading theory, since neurons are constantly "recording" new information, at some point the neurons need to "turn off" in order to reset themselves and prepare to learn again. "If this hypothesis is correct, that means that at some point [if you're putting off sleep] you're beginning to overwhelm your neuronsyou are reaching the limit of how much input they can get." So the neurons "take the rest, even if they shouldn't"and there's a price to pay in terms of making "stupid" errors, he said. Even "Alert" People Make Mistakes Sleep deprivation may have dangerous consequences, Tononi saidand those mistakes may become more common. For one, many people are getting fewer z's. In 2008 about 29 percent of U.S. adults reported sleeping fewer than seven hours per night, and 50 to 70 million had chronic sleep and wakefulness disorders, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Adults generally need about seven to nine hours of sleep a day, according to the National Sleep Foundation. What's more, you don't need to feel sleepy to screw up, Tononi emphasized. "Even if you may feel that you're fit and fine and are holding up well," he said, "some parts of your brain may not [be] ... and those are the ones that make judgments and decisions."

 Too Hard for Science?: The sense of meaning in dreams By Charles Q. Choi in Scientific American April 11, 2011 In dreams, could we discover where the mysterious feeling of revelation comes from? The scientist: Robert Stickgold, director of the Center for Sleep and Cognition at Harvard Medical School. The idea: Dreams often feel profoundly meaningful, bizarre experiences often interpreted over the centuries as messages from the gods or as windows into the unconscious. However, maybe our brains are just randomly stringing experiences together during sleep and investing the result with a feeling of profundity. "When people learn about what I do, they often tell me about their dreams without me asking, and I can't tell you how many times people told me they had the most amazing dreams, and they're almost never amazing  they're almost always somehow embarrassingly uninteresting," Stickgold says. "But this happens to me, too." By investigating why dreams feel profound, one might learn how events get imbued with this sense of meaning  perhaps the same one felt during revelations. Stickgold notes that during REM sleep, when dreaming typically occurs, the release of the neurotransmitter serotonin is shut off in the brain. The only other time that happens is because of LSD, "when people seem to have these totally uninteresting experiences they describe as profoundly meaningful called 'acid insights.'" This sense of meaning may be a physical phenomenon "just like hunger or thirst, save that it's the excitement we feel upon a great insight, that 'Aha!' feeling," Stickgold says. "Who knows why, for instance, fireworks often seem to trigger it  maybe there's something about the geometric patterns that evokes this sense of awesomeness, the feeling that we can almost understand something amazing but not quite that drives us to seek a better understanding of things. It's like what you feel during a religious experience  you sense the oneness of mankind." During dreams, the brain might be associating disjointed experiences together to create potentially valuable combinations of thoughts. "It could be the brain is making you focus your attention on material that was only weakly associated before and investing this association with this feeling of profundity to help it mine these connections for something not immediately obvious but potentially important," Stickgold says. "It makes sense that the sensation would be a positive and reinforcing one." The problem: The difficulty in exploring this idea is that how meaningful something is might be too hard to measure. "It's a bit like beauty  it's in the mind of the beholder," Stickgold says. "It's not like heart rate or the level of electrical conductivity of the skin, which you have outside evidence of. If a person says something is meaningful, you're not sure how to measure that, and you're not sure how, if at all, that applies to others. One has to come up with a meaningful definition of meaningful." The solution? Experiments with drugs that suppress or boost serotonin levels could explore any connections between the neurotransmitter and the feeling of meaning. "You could give people such compounds or a placebo and get them to rate how deep or meaningful specific movie clips seems to them," Stickgold suggests. Although dreaming most frequently occurs in REM sleep, it also occurs in non-REM sleep. Researchers could ask people if dreams during non-REM sleep, when serotonin levels aren't suppressed, "feel as intense and bizarre and emotional as ones during REM sleep," Stickgold says. One might also try giving serotonin-influencing drugs to people as they sleep and dream, he adds. "It's clear that there is a useful scientific question here," Stickgold notes. "What is it about the dream process that so frequently and universally across people generates this very strong perception of something like importance or significance or deepness, a feeling we find hard to define, and one that's often totally wrong, in that when you tell others about your dreams, you find they don't have any obvious significance? It's just a matter of clarifying what the question really is, and then finding a good way of exploring it." 
 I've been struggling with restless legs straight for a couple of days now. It just isn't going away. I want to do something awful to my stupid legs. I am going to mention this to my doctor the next time I see her. It's pretty miserable. I've read it can be related to anemia and I wonder if this is true in my case. 
 I'm new here so id like to start by saying hello I'd like to begin by saying i never really had issues with sleep up till about 5 years ago. Maybe once every 6 months id have 2 or 3 nights in a row that i couldnt sleep. 5 years ago i seperated from my wife and thats where this hell began. I could not get to sleep after this so i went to my doctor and he put me on Ativan i stayed on ativan for 3 years. It worked well most of the time, but then stopped when i lost my job(buisness closure) where i was content at. So again seemingly triggered by stress. Since then ive been on various meds mostly Benzos, basically all the sleep meds ive tried with limited success. Now for the last year i often fall asleep in minutes but wake up feeling like i havnt slept, lately i feel almost like im daydreaming while sleeping. I thought i might of had rls as in the last 2 months my leg drives me nuts in the evening so i went and got sinemet for it. It helps my leg, it doesnt bother me now in the evenings, ive been on it for a month, but it hasnt helped my sleep much. Im taking zopiclone as well but like i said generally i fall asleep fast and generally feel like im sleeping ok but obviously am not. Ive tried all the tricks to help but doesnt help me,(excercise, reading,soo many things). Ive always been strests out over things since i was a kid and feeling kinda bla. But ive always been this way so to say im depressed is hard because this is all i know. Ive never thought of myself as depressed but ive got issues with alot of things like anxiety at times, dont like crowded places, think people are looking at me at the mall, problem with showing my gf affection which in turn stresses me out because i know she needs it. Maybe my sleeping problems come from stress, i dont know.. I tried paxil 6 months ago and i took it for about 8 or 9 days and i felt better, hard to explain but it felt a bit like a high or something( i dont do drugs). But i stopped it because i was having sexual sideeffects...im in line to see a sleep specialist but it will take months to get in. Its been 2 years now of 2 or so hours of sleep at night(thats what id say my non restfull sleep adds up to and im fed up with it and my life but for the sake of my wife and kids i try to function decently which i mostly accomplish. But im tired, really tired of this.... Any advice? (sorry for the long post but i could ramble on for hours about this) 
 Fighting Fatigue with Diet By Erik Strand, Psychology Today October 01, 2003 Everyone from time to time experiences fatigue; for some it is an almost daily struggle. It can be a serious drag on your mood. Broadly speaking, fatigue is simply mental or physical exhaustion. In many ways it is a normal phenomenon, a process that slows the body down at the end of the day and prepares us for sleep, or protects overworked muscles from possible injury. Too often however, fatigue is a negative force in our lives: at best an inconvenience, at worst completely debilitating. Though fatigue is poorly understood, some simple dietary changes can help us keep fatigue from getting us down. Drink plenty of water. We've all been told a thousand times, but a lot of us still don't get enough. Mild dehydration is a common and often overlooked cause of fatigue. Dehydration can reduce blood flow to organs, slowing down your brainand you along with it. Drink about eight glasses of water a day, and don't wait until you're thirsty. Eat breakfast. The brain is fuel-hungry, using up to 30 percent of calories. A good breakfast refills our energy stores, keeping lethargy at bay during the morning hours. This is especially true for children, who have a higher metabolism and smaller energy reserves. Include carbohydrates at breakfasta whole grain muffin with peanut butter, a piece of fruit and a glass of skim milk. Eat protein and carbs in combination, especially at lunch. It's not your imagination: that drowsy, dopey feeling you get around 4pm is part of your brain's natural daily rhythms. Dr. Judith Wurtman, a pioneering food researcher at MIT, recommends eating carbohydrates and protein in tandem at lunchtime to fight the afternoon doldrums. Protein contains the amino acid tryptophan, precursor of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that promotes a calm, relaxed feeling, which helps to fight emotional fatigue. Eaten with protein, carbohydrates may boost the brain's intake of tryptophan. Protein-rich foods also contain tyrosine, a precursor to neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, promoters of alertness, attention, and motivation. "There's one group of people who are especially susceptible to afternoon fatigue," says Wurtman. "They're called 'women.'" Women often choose skimpy salads for lunch, leaving them at a loss for the nutrients they need. Opt instead for lean protein and unrefined carbohydrates to elevate energy and mood. Use caffeine judiciously. Caffeinated beverages fight fatigue. Caffeine not only makes you feel more energized, it also increases alertness, reaction speed and ability to think clearly for up to three hours. Harris Lieberman, Ph.D., research psychologist for the U.S. Army, reports that even if you're already rested, a single can of cola can improve vigilancethe ability to pay attention to a boring task. But five or six cups of coffee a day can make you irritable and jittery, actually decreasing performance on some tasks; caffeine late in the day can cause insomnia. If caffeine's your thing, try one cup in the morning and a Diet Coke with lunch. Get enough calories, but avoid big meals. While overeating is a serious problem for many folks (and can itself lead to fatigue), if you're an intensely active person or you're on a stringent diet, you may not be getting enough calories. Needs vary: take care to consume enough calories for your gender, body type, and activity level. High-intensity exercisers need to get enough protein. Don't, however, take all your calories in one or two daily feasts. Instead, eat five or six smaller meals. A full stomach draws blood to the belly and away from the brain, leaving you listless and dull. Smaller meals also help to keep insulin levels constant, avoiding fluctuations of energy and mood. Eat iron-rich foods. Iron enables blood to carry oxygen to the organs of the body. Deprived of adequate oxygen, the brain cannot function optimally, leading to lack of mental acuity and feelings of fatigue. Iron intake is not in general a problem for men, but many women have mild iron deficiency. If you suspect you're not getting enough iron, boost your intake with foods like lean red meat, liver, spinach, and apricots. 
 I wasn't sure whether to post this in anxiety or here. Either way, I was wondering if this could be anxiety or not. I know I have anxiety embedded in me, if that makes any sense. I could be anxious and not even know why. I am aware of it thorough certain signs. I just got back from vacation and while on vacation I was very relaxed. I didn't bite my nails at all (indicator for me). As soon as I get back, nothing in particular has happened but I bit all my nails off and lately I have not been able to sleep. Which is out of the ordinary for me. I have a strict schedule (hahahah, I know that sounds lame as an adult). I would go to bed at the same time every night and wake up early. Lately I have been going to bed late and not being able to sleep. Just lying there, daydreaming non- stop for around 2 hours (not deep sleep, vivid dreams) and then sleeping for a couple more and then waking up again and daydreaming again. It's been awful. Could this be anxiety? It's not worry daydreaming, nor a list of things I have to do just pure fun daydreaming. Not so fun because its 2 in the morning and I cant sleep. 
 Cortico-thalamic dissociation in Sleep Paralysis By Paul Mason, Macquarie University, in Neuroanthropology January 27, 2011 Have you ever woken up and not been able to move your body? For those people who have experienced this sensation, it is unnerving, surreal, and often quite stressful. Rest assured though, that this condition is benign, harmless, and your body will wake up after a minute or two. People also report that their body wakes up when someone touches them, or even at the sound of a surprising noise. Despite the temporary sensation of uncanny paralysis upon wakening, you can ride the episode out with the knowledge that it has not been associated with any medical disorders. This condition, known as sleep paralysis, is rare but not uncommon. Funnily enough, in the last year, three of my friends have asked me about this conditiontwo of them medical doctors. Sleep paralysis is a parasomnia usually associated with REM sleep. Episodes typically last one to three minutes and disappear spontaneously by themselves or by someone elses touch. Dreams can potentially superimpose onto reality during this period. However, the condition is usually experienced as a dream state without the dreams. In other words, your body has still turned off control of its muscles as though you are dreaming, but your brain is strangely awake. In medical terms, the condition is considered a dissociated REM state where the motor atonia of REM is present in isolation. That basically means that control of your muscles has been turned off but consciousness has been switched on. When my friends asked me what I thought about the symptoms they described, I was reminded of my undergraduate study in neuropsychology where I learned about lesion studies in cats that disrupted areas in the brain to do with sleep, dreaming, and muscle control. In this study, researchers performed lesions to areas of the brain in cats that normally inhibit motor control during sleep. The lesion was performed to the ventral locus coeruleus of the Pons (its weird what you remember sometimes). This lesion caused the cats to exhibit strange sleepwalking behaviour that allowed researchers an uncanny little window into Kitty dreams. Im not sure, but if you search for dream enactment, then you should find plenty of information on the web. Anyway, my first thought about sleep paralysis was that there must be some kind of delay in switching off the area inhibiting motor control during a hypnopompic or postdormital sleep paralysis episode. Im not suggesting that sleep paralysis is associated with anatomical problems, merely an occasional physiological hiccupsomething as simple as say pins and needles in an otherwise healthy organ. Possibly the hiccup can occur in the Pons Possibly, as recent research indicates, it could be somewhere else Of my friends who shared their symptoms with me and asked me for my thoughts, one was doing shift-work, the other was suffering from severe jet-lag, and the third slept odd hours due to an erratic rotation schedule at her job. Im not a medical doctor, but the suggestion of sucking a melatonin tablet under the tongue before bed for only a couple of nights worked wonders for my friend with jet-lag. But, you also have to consider that episodes of sleep paralysis are rare, so they probably disappeared by themselves. For my other friends I suggested potassium rich foods such as bananas, which are always yummy to eat anyway, (those friends havent told me of any episodes since, but then again that is anecdotal as well). From scant research reports on the subject, it appears that sleep paralysis occasionally occurs in a familial form, affects females more often than males, and has an X-linked dominant transmission. Talking with my Indonesian friends suggests to me that the condition is not as rare as Western medical practitioners think. But then again, I have lived with Indonesians who have some extremely erratic sleeping schedules. I am fascinated in the phenomenology and neurophenomenology of sleep paralysis episodes. One of my friends reported a hypnagogic auditory hallucination accompanying an episode of sleep paralysis. Not surprisingly, she is not the only person in her family to occasionally suffer from the condition. In my own experience, I have had a hypnagogic visual hallucination as a child of five or six years of age. Before my teenage years, I also had an episode of what I now understand to be sleep paralysis. I woke up in the morning and could not for the life of me open my eyes. My eyelids were as heavy as lead (Pb), and then it felt like bees were performing the waggle dance all over my closed eyes. It was an overwhelming experience at the time but I cant recall if I woke up or went back to sleep afterward. If Im not making stories up, I was eventually able to open my eyes, but then I shut them again and went back to sleep. As a side note, the word hypnagogic says so much to me about medical practice. A hypnagogic hallucination is literally just a hallucination that one experiences just before or just after falling asleep. We dont actually have an explanation for hypnagogic hallucinations, but we do have a fancy label with two lovely multi-syllabic words. On numerous occasions, friends have shared private stories about hallucinations with me. If they have been stressed by the episode then calming them simply involved asking if they were in bed at the time, which they have thus far always confirmed, and then I merely say, Dont worry, you just experienced a hypnagogic hallucination. Its not unusual in the slightest.On every occasion, labeling the episode makes a friend happy. I have even seen colleagues in medicine calm other acquaintances using the very same words. Its fantastic, but it really makes me wonder how much people seek a label and how much people seek an explanation. In research published in PNAS only in February last year (Magnin et al. 2010), researchers have made headway in describing the physiology underlying hypnagogic hallucinations. Using electrodes implanted into the brains of epileptic patients (a common pre-surgical practice to localize the origins of epileptic seizures), researchers opportunisticallybut ethicallyused the data to reveal what happens in the deepest parts of the brain during sleep onset. The activity of deep structures in the brain is difficult to image because MRI is too slow and EEG is too superficial. This electrophysiology research revealed a surprising finding: The thalamus (a small but dense deep brain structure highly interconnected to body and cortical regions and involved in receiving sensory information) goes to sleep some ten minutes before the cortex.When falling asleep, the thalamus shuts us off from the outside world, but the cortex continues to function which could explain, as the researchers hypothesize, how hallucinations can arise when we fall asleep. A hypothesis about sleep paralysis: The finding that extensive cortical regions remain activated for several minutes after thalamic deactivation at sleep onset might explain forms of insomnia associated with lesions to the thalamus, and it also might be the reason that hypnagogic experiences commonly occur during the wakesleep transition. In the thirteen people studied, they did not find desynchronization of the thalamus and cortex during awakening. But that was only thirteen people. If someone who experienced an episode of sleep paralysis was under observation, would we find that awareness with paralysis upon waking was associated with a desynchronization of the thalamus and cortex? If the cortex reactivated before the thalamus could sleep paralysis be the result? An episode of sleep paralysis typically only lasts a few minutes. Knowing that desynchronization of the thalamus and cortex during sleep onset lasts only several minutes, then it is not implausible to hypothesize that there could be a lapse between the reactivation of the cortex and the reactivation of the thalamus in sleep paralysis that lasts only a few minutes. If the cortex wakes up before the thalamus, people might be lucid but unable to move. The cessation of sleep paralysis by physical touch might be explained by the idea that touch might be igniting sensory systems that activate the thalamus. As an ostensibly benign condition, and one that occurs rarely and unpredictably, sleep paralysis might not be the most accessible or indeed imperative area of medical research, but as a case of dissociative consciousness it is a deeply fascinating research venture into the awareness of who we are.

 Vitamin D: Daytime Energy the Old Fashioned Way by Michael J. Breus, Ph.D., Psychology Today January 20, 2011 What can one vitamin really do for your energy levels? Once again I love it when a mystery is revealed, or at least partially explained. I was reading a case study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine and it helped confirm a hypothesis I have had for a while about the importance of vitamins to your sleep. Look at the Busy Bs: Did you know that Vitamin B can help regulate the use of tryptophan? B3: Has been shown to increase REM sleep, help with depression in some cases and a decrease in nighttime awakenings.B6: is essential in the production of serotonin, the calming hormone that helps calm the body before falling asleep.Folic Acid: deficiency in folic acid deficient can be found in those with insomniaImportant Minerals: Calcium and Magnesium, taken in a 2:1 ratio, can be helpful for sleepCalcium: is a natural relaxant which has a calming effect on the nervous system. 500 mg daily can be helpful (soda can actually strip away calcium).Magnesium: is a mineral that appears to help assist chronic sleep problems as well. It should be taken 250 mg daily with 500 mg. of calcium.But a recent case study has shown that a patient with severe sleepiness, and a vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation improved daytime sleepiness dramatically: The patient was a 28 year old female. She was suffering for about 4 months with excessive sleepiness. Her symptoms started slowly and continued to progress.She kept a standard bedtime between 10 and 11 pm, and she reported falling asleep within minutes. She would wake at 7:30 am and reported that she did not think that she was sleeping poorly. She would get her kids ready for school and then be back in bed by 8am until noon. She would then nap from 4 pm to 7 pm. She reported about 14 hours of sleep per day.Her sleep study showed no signs of sleep apnea or other sleep disorder. During her clinic visit she showed no signs of narcolepsy, depression or anxiety. Her next day nap study was unremarkable.She reported muscle fatigue and pain, as well as headaches, her labwork showed a thyroid in the low but normal range and she had low levels of vitamin D.She was started on a Vitamin D supplementation at 50,000 units once per week (IV) and within 2 weeks she started to see a decrease in her sleepiness and fatigue. Vitamin D is actually considered a fat soluble hormone that can be received in foods (dietary sources and fish) or is self-manufactured by the skin after exposure to UVB light. A Vitamin D deficiency has been noticed as a global issue and recently found in underserved populations, patients in northern latitudes, people with darker skin tones, the elderly, obese and pregnant or lactating women. Also very common in areas with a high degree of sunshine (this seems counter-intuitive, but think about all that sunblock!). Recent studies have linked Vitamin D deficiency to metabolic syndrome, muscle pain, and even type 2 diabetes. So why do we think it helped her sleepiness? It is really hard to say, but I have seen this in some of my patients. It could be linked to a decrease in sleep disturbing pain. Or Vitamin D may be something that will help decrease a persons drive for sleep. Only more research in this exciting new area can tell us. Check with your doctor about vitamin supplementation. We all work hard, and eating right isnt always easy - and even when we do, we may not get what we need from the food we eat. Our bodies actually make vitamin D, but we have to get enough sunlight to make that happen effectively. 
 Hi ya all. So, a while back I was getting recurring nightmares on a moderate level, so I talked to my doctor about it and he suggested Prazosin, and prescribed me 3 pills right before bed. Prazosin is actually just a blood pressure med that had been discovered to help prevent nightmares and night terrors. Anyway, it actually worked for about a month, but it all came back, and with a vengeance. Every single night I have these horrendous nightmares where I feel like I am dying (a very fearful experience I gotta say), and there is usually something going on with my loved ones, like they are dying, or sometimes they hate me. But the feeling of dying and all the abstract visions involved, and the fact that it occurs EVERY single night is getting to be too much. I wake up (like in a night terror) several times a night. Now this is all different from when I started on Prazosin. The nightmares back then were more so 'so weird that they were disturbing', they were moderate. These nightmares are exceptionally severe. I'm wondering if Prazosin reversed it's effect on me. Has anyone else used this medication for nightmares or night terrors? I rarely get to see my doctor since I'm with the VA, so I have to advise myself. I think I will try sleeping without taking the Prazosin for a few nights and see what happens. Maybe someone here can link me a page that discusses cures for nightmares and night terrors? Or maybe one about Prazosin? Thanks all! -Matt 
 Shorter Sleep Duration Linked to Mental Distress By Candida Fink, MD October 27, 2010 We all know how important sleep is in maintaining mental health and mood stability. Results from a recent study confirm this and serve as a caution to parents and mental health professionals alike not to overlook sleep anomalies as early warning signs of depression, bipolar, or anxiety disorders in teenagers and young adults. The lead author of the study is Nick Glozier, MBBS, MRCPsych, PhD, associate professor of psychological medicine at the Brain and Mind Research Institute and the Centre for Integrated Research and Understanding of Sleep (CIRUS) at the University of Sydney in Australia. The study found that young adults (17-24 years of age) who get fewer than eight hours of sleep per night are at greater risk of experiencing psychological distress  a combination of high levels of depression and anxiety. The study showed a 14% increase for each hour of sleep less than eight hours. As the researchers point out, shorter sleep duration may be a cause of mental distress or a symptom of underlying mental distress or both (comorbid). However, according to Glozier, The increased reporting of stress seen in many countries over the past decade or two in this young adult population may reflect lifestyle or other changes that lead to too few hours of sleep. The authors are careful to point out that their study does not call for any broad efforts in increase sleep duration among all young adults. Targeting those at greatest risk  those suffering from mental distress or experiencing extremely brief sleep cycles of 1-5 hours per night  is key. The take away lesson from this study and others like it is the importance of getting a sufficient amount of sleep (for children and adults both young and old), and the importance of intervention when sleep durations become extremely brief. 
 The Mystery of Deep Sleep by John Cline, Ph.D., Psychology Today Blogs October 11, 2010 Deep sleep is a mysterious state that we usually enter several times each night. The nature of deep sleep is somewhat less well known than the more dramatic dream sleep. While we are very aware today of dream sleep and of the ability of some people to be conscious of and even direct their dreams in a state known as lucid dreaming, the nature of deep sleep continues to invite a sense of mystery. Sleep stages were first discovered in the 1930s when Loomis and his colleagues began doing overnight EEG recordings of sleeping people. It became clear that the EEG of sleep is not unitary and, in fact, changes over the course of the night. Stages of sleep were recognized by the regular changes noted in the EEG. By the late 1960s it was possible to specify ways of reliably scoring these stages and some knowledge existed about their presumed role in the restorative process of sleep. Because of the dramatic nature of dreams and their historical role in religion, literature and psychoanalysis, REM sleep, during which these vivid experiences occur, became well known to the public. Less emphasis has been placed on the non-dream state of deep sleep. This stage of sleep is also known as delta sleep, slow wave sleep or, more recently, N3. It is called delta sleep because of the presence of high amplitude, low frequency delta waves that are seen to occur in the EEG. In the past this stage was divided into two stages, stage 3 and stage 4, depending on the percentage of delta waves present. Stage 4 has a greater amount of delta wave activity than does stage 3 and was thought of as a deeper state of sleep. Research has not, however, been able to clearly show any significant difference in the benefit of these two stages, and more recently they have been combined into a single stage called N3. Subjectively deep sleep is a time of nearly complete disengagement from the environment. It is very difficult to awaken a person in deep sleep, and children in this state may be nearly impossible to wake up. It is from this stage that sleepwalking emerges. This happens when there is a sudden arousal from deep sleep that causes the motor centers of the brain but not the higher centers to awaken so that the person is in a sleep state dissociation characterized by complex motor activity with limited judgment and awareness. Many important physiological processes occur during deep sleep. Most deep sleep occurs during the first two sleep cycles with the greatest amount of deep sleep typically occurring in the first cycle. As the night progresses, deep sleep decreases and is replaced by the lighter stage 2 sleep and there is an increasing amount of REM sleep toward morning. Deep sleep is extremely effective in decreasing sleep drive that builds steadily with wakefulness over the course of the day. It is far more effective than stage 2 sleep in this regard. One reason that short afternoon naps of about 20 minutes may not affect night time sleep while longer ones may result in difficulty falling asleep, is that in a short nap there is not enough time to cycle into deep sleep and most sleep is stage 2. If N3 sleep occurs during the nap, it will rapidly decrease sleep drive and make it hard to fall asleep later that night. Human growth hormone (HGH) is released in a pulsed manner during deep sleep and interruption of this stage abruptly stops release of this hormone. The drug gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) was once used by body builders because it causes an increase in deep sleep. With this increase in deep sleep there is also a release of growth hormone. In adults growth hormone promotes cell repair that is necessary after the stress of weight training. In the past GHB was freely available as a supplement. Unfortunately, the ability of this drug to induce sleep was misused by some who turned it into a date rape drug. It is now tightly controlled and available only by prescription for treatment of disorders such as narcolepsy. There are also psychological benefits of deep sleep. By rapidly reducing sleep need, this stage of sleep is an especially refreshing part of the sleep cycle, unless you are wakened out of it, in which case you will feel very sluggish and may have sleep drunkenness in which it unsafe to drive. Some recent neural network research also indicates that deep sleep may be important in helping clear the brain for new learning the next day. In some eastern mystical traditions the state of consciousness through which we ordinarily experience the world is thought of as being one of gross awareness. There is a more subtle state of awareness that may be developed through meditation and can be thought of as being more subtle and like that of the dreaming state of consciousness. The deepest level of consciousness in this scheme is the very subtle one in which it is possible to become aware of the emptiness in which all phenomenon are thought to occur. According to the integral philosopher Ken Wilber, with training in advanced meditation, it is possible for people to be aware of the subtle and very subtle states of consciousness to the point of being aware of the states of dreaming and even the state of deep sleep. We now know that lucid dreaming is possible. During lucid dreaming people can be aware of and alter their dreams. If Wilber is correct, then some advanced practitioners of meditation may actually be able to maintain a form of conscious awareness of even the formless void of deep sleep. Whether or not most of us are aware of the state of deep sleep, it functions to restore us physically and mentally. Unfortunately deep sleep is very vulnerable to the effects of stress, sleep disruption, ageing, and many drugs. By preventing adequate deep sleep all of these factors contribute to the run down, tired feelings that many people who are dealing with financial pressure, sleep apnea, getting older and taking certain drugs experience daily. So what can we do to get more of this marvelous, mysteriously restorative sleep stage? We can't turn back the clock on aging, or eliminate life's ubiquitous stressors, and there is no easy fix- but when we take steps to insure that we have a regular, pre-midnight bedtime, that we get any apnea problem treated, and that we use relaxation breathing or other meditative techniques to slip into sleep, we may indeed find that the mysterious and restorative powers of deep sleep are within our reach. It's worth the attempt! 
 Sleep and Mental Health By Michael Craig Miller, M.D., Harvard Medical School July 23, 2010 Americans are notoriously sleep deprived. Whether it's stress, financial worries or the Internet keeping people up, 10% to 18% of adults have chronic sleep problems. A study published in the June issue of Neurology found that almost one in five adults suffers moderate to excessive daytime sleepiness. That's a lot of yawning and nodding off! But people with mental health conditions are even more likely to have problems sleeping: 50% to 80% of patients in a typical psychiatric practice have chronic sleep problems. They are particularly common in patients with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies in both adults and children now suggest that while sleep problems may be a symptom of a mental disorder, they can increase the risk for developing some mental illnesses. The good news is that treating a sleep disorder may help relieve mental symptoms and decrease the risk of getting them in the first place. Benefits of Sleep Brain studies suggest that a good night's sleep helps foster both mental and emotional resilience. Chronic sleep disruptions, however, set the stage for negative thinking and emotional vulnerability. Normal sleepers cycle between two major categories of sleep every 90 minutes  although the length of time spent in one or the other changes as sleep progresses. "Quiet" sleep  We move through four stages of increasingly deep sleep. Body temperature drops, muscles relax, and heart rate and breathing slow. The deepest stage of quiet sleep produces physiological changes that help boost immune system functioning.REM (rapid eye movement) sleep  This is the period when people dream. Body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and breathing increase to levels measured when people are awake. Studies report that REM sleep enhances learning and memory, and contributes to emotional health. Scientists have discovered that sleep disruption impairs thinking and the ability to regulate our emotional reactions. In this way, insomnia may add to the effects of psychiatric disorders, and vice versa. Sleep Disorders in Psychiatric Patients Sleep problems are a common part of these mental health disorders: Depression Studies show that between 65% and 90% of adult patients with major depression have some kind of sleep problem. Ninety percent of depressed children have a sleep problem. Sleep problems make it more likely that people prone to depression will develop symptoms. They make depression less responsive to treatment (both medication and psychotherapy). And depression is more likely to return even in patients whose mood improves with therapy. Bipolar disorder Bipolar disorder leads to two different kinds of sleep issues. During a manic episode (the "up" pole), up to 99% of people have insomnia or want less sleep. In bipolar depression (the "down" pole), however, as many as 75% of patients sleep too much (hypersomnia), while others may experience insomnia or restless sleep. In many cases, when a sleep problem gets worse, it can be a clue that an episode of mania or bipolar depression is about to begin. Lack of sleep can trigger mania. Anxiety Worrying is not good for peaceful sleep. Sleep problems affect more than 50% of adults with generalized anxiety disorder. People with (PTSD), panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder or phobias may also have trouble sleeping. People with anxiety take longer to fall asleep and tend to sleep less deeply than people without anxiety. The lack of sleep, in turn, can make anxiety symptoms worse. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Sleep problems affect one-quarter to one-half of children with ADHD. These children may have difficulty falling asleep, sleep fewer hours, or appear restless during sleep. Sleep disorders can lead to ADHD symptoms such as hyperactivity, inattentiveness and irritability. Ways To Improve Sleep The treatment for insomnia  which is the most common sleep problem  is the same for people with and without a mental health disorder. The basics include a combination of lifestyle changes, behavioral strategies, psychotherapy and drugs, if necessary. Lifestyle changes. Most people know that caffeine contributes to sleeplessness, but so can alcohol and nicotine. Alcohol initially depresses the nervous system, which helps some people fall asleep. But the effects wear off in a few hours and people wake up. Nicotine is a stimulant that speeds heart rate and thinking. Giving up these substances is best, but certainly avoid them before bedtime if you can.Physical activity. Regular aerobic activity helps people fall asleep faster and stay asleep. It also increases time spent in deep sleep. Exercise in the evening makes it harder for some people to fall asleep, so avoid evening exercise if you fit into this category. And leave yourself time to wind down after exercising.Sleep hygiene. Many experts believe that people learn insomnia and the way to overcome the problem is by learning good "sleep hygiene." This term is often used for tips like: Keep a regular sleep-and-wake scheduleUse the bedroom only for sleeping or sexKeep the bedroom dark and free of distractions (no computer or television) Some experts also recommend sleep retraining. This involves restricting most of the time you spend in bed to sleeping rather than worrying about not sleeping.Cognitive behavioral therapy. People with insomnia tend to become preoccupied with not falling asleep. Cognitive behavioral techniques help them to change negative expectations and build more confidence that they can have a good night's sleep. These techniques can also help people stop the "blame game" of attributing every personal problem during the day to lack of sleep.Relaxation techniques. Meditation, guided imagery, deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation (alternately tensing and releasing muscles) can quiet anxiety and a mind full of thoughts. Medication Options If non-drug treatments are not enough, sleep medication is an option. In some cases, both a sleep disorder and a psychiatric problem can be treated with one drug. People with depression and bipolar disorder often see improved sleep when they have their underlying illness treated. For depression, it is often useful to start with or add a sedating antidepressant (such as trazodone or one of the tricylic antidepressants). A mood stabilizer may normalize sleep in bipolar disorder. Because antidepressants can trigger mania, it is often best to add sleep aids if sleep is not regulated by the mood stabilizer alone. Many of the standard anti-anxiety medications  benzodiazepines like lorazepam (Ativan) or alprazolam (Xanax)  are also used as sleep medications. But, as with mood disorders, sleep often improves when the anxiety is treated. The opposite is true in ADHD: Stimulants tend to prevent sleep, so they should be taken early in the day. A Good Night's Sleep It's best to take direct aim at sleep problems, rather than treating them as a minor symptom. This may help improve a person's mood, anxiety level and ability to focus. In other words, better sleep may be the route to a better quality of life. 
 Napping isn't just for children. Understand types of naps, pros and cons of napping, and the best way to take a nap. Mayo Clinic October 6, 2010 If you're sleep deprived or just looking for a way to relax, you may be thinking about taking a nap. Napping at the wrong time of day or for too long can backfire, though. Understand how to get the most out of a nap. What are the benefits of napping? Napping offers various benefits for healthy adults, including: RelaxationReduced fatigueIncreased alertnessImproved moodImproved performance, including quicker reaction time, better memory, less confusion, and fewer accidents and mistakesWhat are the downsides to napping? Napping isn't for everyone. Some people have trouble sleeping in places other than their own beds, while others simply can't sleep during the day. Napping can also have negative effects, such as: Sleep inertia. You may feel groggy and disoriented after waking up from a nap.Nighttime sleep problems. Short naps generally don't affect nighttime sleep quality for most people. However, if you experience insomnia or poor sleep quality at night, napping may worsen these problems. Long naps may interfere with nighttime sleep.When should I consider a nap? You might consider making time for a nap if you: Experience new fatigue or unexpected sleepinessAre about to experience sleep loss, for example, due to a long work shiftWant to make planned naps part of your daily routineWhat's the best way to take a nap? To get the most out of a nap, follow these simple tips: Keep naps short. Aim to nap for only 10 to 30 minutes. The longer you nap, the more likely you are to feel groggy afterward.Take naps in the afternoon. The best time for a nap is usually midafternoon, around 2 or 3 p.m. This is the time of day when you may experience post-lunch sleepiness or a lower level of alertness. In addition, naps taken during this time are less likely to interfere with nighttime sleep. Keep in mind, however, that individual factors  such as your need for sleep and your sleeping schedule  can also play a role in determining the best time of day to nap.Create a restful environment. Nap in a quiet, dark place with a comfortable room temperature and few distractions.After napping, be sure to give yourself time to wake up before resuming activities  particularly those that require a quick or sharp response.

 Hi everyone, So this lack and disrupted sleeping is really getting to me. For 4 months now I have not managed to sleep the whole night through until my alarm goes off in the morning (and I do not sleep in late). I am doing pretty much all of the 'right' things and also not doing the 'wrong' things. I get exercise, I have a good diet, I don't drink caffeinated or sugary drinks, I don't eat anything at least 2-3 hours before going to bed, do at least 10 minutes of deep breathing when I get in to bed and feel calm, etc etc. I go to bed feeling very tired and sleepy and have no problem falling asleep, I am asleep within 5-10 minutes of getting in to bed. Then I get up in the morning feeling hardly rested and just a bit less tired than I was before I went to sleep. I go to bed between 11.30-12.30am, without fail have been waking up between 3.45-4.30am every morning, takes me a while to get back to sleep, then wake up around 6am, then 7am, and usually give up then and forget about trying to get back to sleep for 30mins-1 hour which I could do. So it's totally broken up sleep each and every night. Maybe once or twice a week I wake up in a semi-panic attack like-state because of bad dreams and takes me a good 20 minutes to slow down my heartbeat and breathing. I am most nights dreaming, and they're always at least a bit unpleasant, sometimes very unpleasant. Just not sure what else I can do? I've been feeling better the last 2-3 days and I've been sleeping even worse. Thanks. 
 He Slept, She Slept: Sex Differences in Sleep By Matt McMillen, WebMD September 24, 2010 How sleep differs between men and women Anna and her husband go to bed at the same time. That’s the only part of their sleep routine that they have in common. "We have very distinct sleep patterns and sleep issues," says Anna, 42, who asked that her last name be withheld for privacy. “My husband tends to fall asleep easily but he wakes up incredibly early. I have trouble falling asleep." The couple, who teach at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, have learned various coping strategies so that they can both get enough sleep. Before they go to bed, for example, Anna’s husband sets out next day’s clothes downstairs. That way, when he gets up at 5 a.m., he can dress without waking Anna, who not only has trouble falling asleep but also finds it nearly impossible to get back to sleep once she has awaken. Studying Sleep What no one has yet learned, however, is precisely how and why women and men differ in the ways that they sleep -- or don’t sleep. Right now, we don’t even know whether men need more sleep than women, or vice versa. “There’s no nationally representative data [on gender differences],” says Michael Twery, PhD, director of the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research, a division of the National Institutes of Health. Twery says that national health surveillance surveys have recently started to ask questions related to sleep. Such surveys will eventually help researchers break down responses along gender lines, potentially providing more insight into how men and women sleep -- and sleep differently. Still, there are a few things that we do know now. According to Twery, women suffer from insomnia at two to three times the rate that men do. Men, on the other hand, are twice as likely to have their slumber spoiled by sleep apnea, a chronic condition characterized by brief episodes of restricted breathing. But, Twery points out, the gap in those rates could partly be due to doctors who don't fully understand the disorder. Women, he says, may experience symptoms of sleep apnea differently than men, and they don’t describe their symptoms in the same terms as men. “This could be influencing the process of diagnosis,” Twery says. In fact, obstructive sleep apnea in women is commonly mistaken for depression, diabetes, hypertension, hypochondria, or a host of other conditions, according the National Sleep Foundation. Whatever the rates, there are certain conditions unique to women that raise their risk for the disorder. One of them is polycystic ovary syndrome, the most common cause of infertility in women. Another is pregnancy. “Some pregnant women begin to snore and have difficulty breathing while sleeping,” Twery says. “What is the danger [to the health of the mother and child]?" Do disturbances in breathing [caused by sleep apnea] affect the cardiovascular health of mother and child? What is the impact for future cardiovascular health? Does sleep apnea resolve after pregnancy?" Experts don’t know. Better Sleep, Better Health Each night, people commonly pass through several stages of sleep, during which the brain undergoes repairs and restoration. The bulk of those repairs, which include the promotion of cell growth and fixing cells damaged due to stress, occurs during deep sleep, which also may promote emotional well-being. For people with sleep disorders, entering and maintaining deep sleep -- if they can sleep at all -- is a challenge. Woman or man, getting an insufficient amount of sleep on a regular basis increases the risk of additional health problems, such as diabetes, depression, cardiovascular disease,and other conditions. Such risks are higher in men than in women, and they are more likely to strike men at an earlier age. Why? Again, we don’t know, though Twery speculates that hormonal differences may protect women until they are older. If hormones do play a protective role, they have also been implicated in sleep problems. “Growth and stress hormones disturb our patterns of sleep,” says Twery, “but how they affect men and women differently has not been studied.” Whatever the gender differences may be, says Twery, they appear to play less of a role in sleep as men and women age. For example, postmenopausal women and men of the same age have the same rate of obstructive sleep apnea. Sharing Sleep - and Sleep Problems One thing we do know is that, for couples who share a bed, one partner’s sleeping problem can easily become a problem for both. “I see couples very often,” says Renee Garfinkel, PhD, a Washington, D.C. psychologist who specializes in treating sleep disorders. “I encourage partners to come in.” “Even when one partner is not sleep disturbed, that can be a problem,” she says. “When the one who cannot sleep looks at his or her significant other, there’s often resentment or jealousy, as well as feelings of loneliness.” In many cases, resolving the sleep issues -- which Garfinkel is often able to accomplish in six to 12 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy -- allows the couple to explore other issues that may have contributed to the poor sleep in the first place, such as depression or marital difficulties. “Resolving insomnia allows other things to be addressed calmly,” says Garfinkel. Despite all that’s unknown, there is at least one clear gender difference: When a sleep problem is disturbing a couple, it’s the woman who makes the appointment with the physician or therapist. That is no surprise. Men are notoriously reluctant to see a doctor for any reason. In Garfinkel’s practice, men often come in only at their partner’s insistence. “Women are much more willing to seek help, to ask directions,” Garfinkel says. Resting Easier Anna, who has had trouble sleeping since she was a child, says that the sleep problems she and her husband have became much more urgent matters once they had children. “Before the kids, I could make up for lost sleep by taking naps, but you just can’t do that with a full time job and little kids running around,” she says. “When our first child was born, we were both saying this is so much harder because we are not great sleepers to begin with.” Nowadays, she wears a sleep mask and takes a sleep aid, the antidepressant trazodone, which is often prescribed for insomnia. “I don’t get sick like I used to now that I am sleeping better,” she says. “I feel like I’ve struggled with sleep for my entire life,” Anna says. “If you don’t figure out what the problem is, it just becomes what your body does.” 
 Women and Sleep: Not Always the Best of Friends By Alice Y. Chang, M.D., Brigham and Women's Hospital July 21, 2010 Lately, I hear myself echoing many of my female patients: Why am I so tired all the time? Recently, my husband took my 15-month-old son out of town for four days. I felt rested like I havent been in the past two years since I became pregnant. And I had the energy to do projects well into the evening. I laughed when my husband was either asleep when I called him at 9 p.m. or kept saying during our phone calls: Why am I so tired? I thought I was supposed to be on vacation! This little personal experiment highlighted for me not only the importance of sleep quantity but sleep quality. For sleep to be restful, it is best for it to be uninterrupted. While I was around, my husband on some level relaxed. He didnt seem to hear the baby wake up at night and probably slept more deeply. Unfortunately, a young child is not the only reason why a woman may feel tired throughout her life. Here are several common reasons why women might not sleep well and tips for getting more rest: Pregnancy Most women expect that sleep might be more difficult during the last trimester of pregnancy, but difficulty sleeping can start in the first trimester. There are actually several factors that can influence sleep during pregnancy: Back pain  This can occur anytime during pregnancy, although it is more common during the last trimester. A good position to learn early in your pregnancy is sleeping on your left side. This position helps to improve blood flow to the uterus and your baby. In this position, put a pillow between your knees to ease tension on the back.Increased urination  Because of the position of the uterus early and late in pregnancy, your may feel like running to the bathroom, even in the night. Although you should be drinking a lot during the day, decrease the amount of fluids you drink in the evening.Leg cramps  No specific cause is usually found. Occasionally a woman may have a low potassium, magnesium, or calcium level in her blood. Gently stretching your legs before going to bed can help.Wild dreams  The hormonal changes during pregnancy can lead to some vivid dreams. If you have particularly scary or anxiety-filled dreams, this can interfere with sleep. Talking them out during the day can ease your mind.Heartburn  Hormonal changes and the physical pressure of the uterus on the diaphragm can lead to first-time symptoms of heartburn, or worsen heartburn that you already have. In either case, symptoms tend to be worse at night. Try not to eat for two to three hours before going to bed. Limit your intake of spicy and fried or fatty foods, especially at night. If you get hungry or have nausea, eat a few plain crackers. Sleeping on a few pillows or raising the head of your bed several inches also can help.Tender breasts  Wearing a comfortable bra to bed can ease your symptoms.Baby kicks  Babies are often most active when we are not moving around. If your baby is particularly active or you are a light sleeper, these kicks can wake you up at night.Restless leg syndrome (RLS)  This creepy-crawly feeling that makes you move your legs can easily interfere with your sleep, even if you dont remember the feeling in the morning. Sometimes, its your bed partner who notices this more than you, especially if you are a big kicker. Iron deficiency is associated with restless legs, and your obstetrician may recommend additional iron supplements if a blood test confirms a low iron level. If that is not the cause, there isnt much you can do about it while youre pregnant. Fortunately, it usually goes away after the delivery.Snoring  Pressure on the diaphragm and increased swelling in your nasal membranes may lead to snoring during pregnancy. Heavy snoring can be accompanied by sleep apnea, when you actually stop breathing for short periods during sleep. Sleep apnea can severely disrupt quality sleep and has been associated with high blood pressure and preeclampsia in pregnant women. So it is important to see your doctor if your partner notices this new symptom. Breastfeeding Breastfeeding is a rest-defying activity on many levels. There are factors beyond just the night feedings to contend with. Although we have an image of the peacefully breastfeeding mother in a rocking chair, possibly relaxed by prolactin levels that rise during breastfeeding, reality can be very different. The rest of the day you may have anxiety from worrying about how your baby is breastfeeding, whether he or she is getting enough milk, or whether you have enough breast milk. If your baby is sleeping through the night  by the way, it might surprise you that this definition is five hours of uninterrupted sleep  you might experience breast tenderness or wet nightclothes from leakage. Some solutions to consider: Wear your bra to bed. In particular, special maternity bras and pads will give you extra support to limit breast tenderness and prevent breast-milk leakage on your clothes or bed sheets.Let Dad help. A friend of mine mastered getting her kids to sleep before pumping breast milk and going to bed at 9 p.m., then having her husband stay up to feed the baby at midnight. She would wake up to do the 3 a.m. feed so she could get at least six hours of sleep, and so would he. Other women will alternate night call for the baby, taking turns so one person does all the feeding one night and then the other gets to sleep. Others have their partners bring the baby to them to feed. Whatever method you design, make sure you design something. Dont try to do it all on your own. Breastfeeding for six months to a year is a long time to go sleep-deprived.Sleep with your baby in your bed, or put your baby in a bassinet near your bed. Having your baby sleep in bed with you is called co-sleeping, and it requires being especially attentive to the babys safety; this may not work for you if you will worry too much about the baby while you sleep. However, if your baby wakes up frequently, it might help him or her to feel and smell Mommy and Daddy nearby. In addition, it can be easier and more relaxing if baby is in the bed to feed him or her quickly without getting out of bed. Menopause The moodiness and irritability of hormonal changes can be made worse by poor sleep quality at night. Hormonal changes themselves can affect your sleep quality. Most often, however, it is the hot flashes at night that affect your sleep. Keep the room cool. Whether that means using a fan, air conditioner or keeping the window open at night, make sure you lower the temperature in the room. Also use lightweight blankets at night or no blankets.Wear lightweight cotton. Wear lightweight cotton fabric, which is less likely to become soaked at night. Wet clothes often wake you up more than the flashes themselves.Consider HRT as a cause. Remember that symptoms of menopause are still an indication for short-term hormone replacement therapy. It should be seriously considered if your sleep is disturbed and should be prescribed at the lowest dose necessary to relieve symptoms. Night-Shift Work Many women seek night shifts or night work in order to take care of their kids during the day. Its hard to understand when they find time to sleep or actually take care of their kids. No one can do this every night, but the successful women find time to get rest and nap during the day. It is also ideal if you can take naps at work, even if it is for 15 or 20 minutes. Additional Tips Avoid alcohol. Even though it seems to make you sleepy, alcohol actually can affect the quality of your sleep, so you dont feel rested in the morning.Exercise. Exercise can relieve tension and improve cardiovascular health. Just make sure that you do not exercise within three hours of trying to sleep.Take naps. Accepting that you might not get the best rest at night, schedule time to nap. Even if you dont actually fall asleep, lying down to rest can help. Also, some people might feel like a nap makes them feel worse when they wake up. This should subside within 30 minutes, and you will end up being more alert while youre awake.Accept or recruit help. While you should definitely get naps while your baby sleeps, you may also need to recruit family or friends to help. Sometimes, your sleep is deeper and more restful when someone is watching your baby. And, if your baby isnt napping frequently anymore, your only chance for a nap may be when someone is helping you out.After reading the above, you might feel an impending sense of doom that women are destined never to rest. Trying to look at the glass as half full, being aware of our need for rest is more than half the battle. We cant change our biology, or maybe even the amount of sleep we get at night, but we can take measures to get the best rest we can, unload our lives and decrease expectations. This can help to increase the rest we get, decrease anxiety, and contribute to our overall health and well-being. Alice Y. Chang, M.D. is a former instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School.

 Working with thoughts: habits take time to change by adiemusfree, HealthSkills Blog September 22, 2010 If only there was a magic wand. I could make millions out of a quick fix to changing habits! Unfortunately my magic wand is red and glittery  and plastic. I call it my self management wand because it reminds me that self management is no quick fix, and a good deal of the work we need to do is about helping people recognize unhelpful thoughts and behaviors that might work in the short term, but not so in the long term. Changing patterns for sleeping well despite chronic pain is no different  what might have been going on for years isnt likely to change overnight. Some of the thoughts that people have when embarking on cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia can be quite unhelpful. One woman I worked with became despondent and eventually gave up because she got very irritable and felt too exhausted to carry on with sleep restriction, and told me her husband didnt want her to stay up until she was sleepy as we had planned because he cant stand me being grumpy all the time. Shed been having problems with sleep for four years, and we had worked on a sleep program for three weeks. Today Id respond a bit differently: when someone says Oh but I just cant do this Id spend more time exploring how long the sleep problem had been going, and discuss the short term vs long term gains. If the problem with sleep has been going on for a long time, the difficulty from sleep restriction over a fortnight or so in order to improve sleep over the long term might be worth it. Its worth using something like a decisional balance chart, or pros and cons chart that draws up the good and not so good of each habit that influences sleep. Habits like going to bed early after a few nights of poor sleep might help the immediate fatigue  but the probability of waking during the night is increased, which in turn maintains the poor sleep pattern. Forgoing the sleep program because of irritability or fatigue might keep the peace at home in the short term  but maintains the erratic sleep pattern that can interfere with good relationships in the long term. If someone is raising the concern that they wont be able to cope with excessive sleepiness during the initial phases of sleep modification, its worth considering introducing change over a Friday to Monday  that way the excessive sleepiness is confined to the weekend. In really challenging cases, the person might be able to take a week off work or a holiday, and time the program to commence during this time. There is good reason not to change the planned program too much because of the persons fears of being too sleepy. This is because one aspect of a sleep program is to evaluate the persons fears that not being able to sleep will lead to catastrophic consequences. By not challenging this belief, a tiny bit of doubt can remain in the persons mind that the program wont work in the real world  or when the person isnt seeing the clinician. Many people start a program but dont manage to carry it out. This seems especially common with regard to that horrid part of sleep management: getting out of bed in the middle of the night if youre not asleep. Youll probably know these thoughts: oh its so nice in bed, its too hard to get out of bed; maybe if I stay in bed Ill just fall asleep, if I get out of bed Ill just wake up properly and then Ill never get any sleep; Ill wake my partner if I get out of bed so Ill just lie here and rest. Something worth considering is to explain to the person that at night some of the parts of the brain that help to evaluate and judge and monitor impulse control (frontal lobes) are affected both by fatigue  and by circadian rhythms. In other words, it is actually harder to reason logically at night, leading to more difficulty following through with difficult actions. By letting the person know that its not your fault, its your brain letting you down, it can help the person understand why it can be more difficult and as a result, help them apply some additional push to overcome that tendency. Working with catastrophic thoughts One of the maintaining factors in insomnia is worry, or rumination. Now while there are some subtle differences between these, Im going to treat them as the same for the purposes of this part of my discussion. Its common to think that being a worrier causes insomnia  and to a certain extent, especially in the initial stages of the problem, thats true. Its very common for people with pain to be worried about a lot of things in the early stages of the pain problem, and what better time to think about these things than when in bed? Well, actually its not an especially good time, particularly in the middle of the night because it helps to maintain alertness, and more importantly, because of the problems with logical reasoning (see above). What typically happens is that thoughts just run around and around without coming to any resolution. Once insomnia is established, self-perpetuating thoughts can maintain it. Things like Ill never get any sleep tonight, or tomorrow is going to be a write-off. By working through these thoughts, perhaps using a whiteboard and listing the thoughts and working through to the worst case scenario (in other words, following the catastrophic chain of thinking, we can work through to the underlying fears that have real emotional sting. Then we need to do some reality testing. Reality testing in this case involves making some estimates of how likely it is that each of these thoughts will come true. Using a percentage, each thought that has been jotted down is given a rating in terms of how probable it is that the fear will come true. The next step is to work out how often each of the catastrophes actually DO come true. For example, if the thought is Ill never get to sleep tonight  how often has that actually come true? How often does the person actually get not a single moment of sleep at night? Probably the answer will be near to nil. The next catastrophe can be discussed the same way  how likely is it that tomorrow is a write-off? It helps to define what write-off actually looks like: is it falling asleep at work? Is it forgetting to do a specific task? The question to ask is how many times have you slept so badly that you fell asleep at work? Again, the answer is probably next to nil, but might be once or twice. Then its important to point out the mismatch between the feared probability and the actual occurrence of the catastrophe. You can do some maths here if you like: work out the number of nights in a year where the person has had insomnia, multiple this by the probability they give of never sleeping, and arrive at a number. Then work out the number of days where the person has actually fallen asleep and multiply this by the number of nights of insomnia. This quite clearly points out the disparity between what the person is worrying about  and the likelihood that it actually happens. It helps at this point to remind the person again that at night, their logical thinking goes awry and so it makes it harder to think clearly, so some helpful phrases could be brought in to counter that fear. Something like I wont sleep at all tonight could be countered with I probably will sleep at least a bit, and even if I do have a bad nights sleep, its not very likely that Ill fall asleep at work, so I can deal with it just fine. By using information from the person, and working through the maths, it helps to reduce the emotional reasoning that can otherwise influence behavior. 
 Sleep problems in chronic pain and what helps HealthSkills Blog September 20, 2010 I have written about sleep problems in people with chronic pain several times. It is one of those aspects of dealing with pain that inevitably arise as I talk with people about energy, their activity through the day, and their mood. Many people blame the pain for their sleep problems, which is unsurprising really  once youre awake in the middle of the night, theres not a lot else to think about! But it seems like while pain might be associated with a sense of poorer quality sleep, and could well have been a factor influencing the onset of insomnia, its often other factors that maintain unsatisfying sleep. What are those factors? Well, one of the first ones is general affective disturbance - in other words, feeling low or flat, whether frankly depressed or not, can lead to changes in sleep architecture. Sleep architecture refers to the patterns of brain activity that are normal and expected in people throughout their sleep. People who are depressed demonstrate shortening of the time from sleep onset to the appearance of the first REM period (short REM latency), while people with fibromyalgia show specific and distinctive abnormalities in the stage 4 deep sleep. During sleep, individuals with fibromyalgia are constantly interrupted by bursts of brain activity typical of being awake, limiting the amount of time they spend in deep sleep. Its also thought that people with central sensitisation syndrome (such as CRPS, irritable bowel, pelvic pain, migraine etc) have similar changes to their sleep pattern - and fatigue is often a feature characterising these problems. Its not only disorders that affect sleep architecture: some medications and common substances also affect sleep, including alcohol, coffee and common sleeping pills. While we cant fix the chronic pain condition, we can treat depression, and we can help people identify any of the substances that might alter sleep patterns. More often than not there are other things that also contribute to maintaining poor sleep. Some studies suggest that poor sleep is maintained by the amount of attention focused on pain, the ways in which pain is interpreted (particularly sad, or irritated responses to pain), and thought patterns particularly before going to sleep (rumination or brooding on pain). These are aspects of sleep management that may not always be addressed in general pain management programmes which often provide sleep hygiene. A thorough assessment of sleep problems is an important part of developing an appropriate management strategy. Sleep assessments in this case dont refer to being wired up at night btw  and Im not referring to sleep problems caused by sleep apnea or snoring. A sleep assessment should cover things like: time of going to bed, and the pre-sleep ritualstime to sleep onset, number and timings of sleep awakenings as well as the length of time awake at these times (not to mention what the person does at these times such as eating, getting out of bed, having a smoke or coffee )waking time, and how refreshed the person feels at this timenaps and timing of exercise during the daycoffee, alcohol, tobacco and other substances takenThese relate directly to sleep hygiene aspects of sleep or things like keeping the bed as a place associated only with sleep (not worrying, watching TV or arguing with others), and developing a regular pattern to going to sleep including relaxation. This is another good handout on sleep hygiene. Now while simple sleep hygiene can be helpful for many people, there are several other strategies that have good evidence to support their use in insomnia. These methods are all included in what is called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Primary Insomnia. This is described by Tang as a multi-component treatment that seeks not only to teach patients about sleep and factors affecting sleep (eg homestatic regulation, circadian rhythm, age, social and work schedule) but also to work with the patient toward minimisng unwanted arousal at bedtime and altering sleep habtis to increase sleep propensity and regularity. More cognitively oriented therapy involves interventions that aim to address worries and beliefs about sleep, particularly anxiety-provoking thoughts like Im losing control over my sleep and safety seeking behaviours (like drinking extra coffee or spending longer in bed). CBT-I can include psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, relaxation training, cognitive therapy, sleep restriction, stimulus control therapy, paradoxical training, biofeedback and imagery training. Of these strategies, relaxation, sleep restriction and stimulus control therapy have the most support from research as stand-alone interventions. CBT-I has been repeatedly shown to be effective for remedying insomnia, and found as effective as hypnotics in the acute treatment phase, with the benefit of providing long-term results. Despite this positive finding, between 43% to 85% of people dont respond to even intensive CBT-I treatment when stringent outcome criteria are applied. When Tang reviewed the content of three RCTs for insomnia for people with chronic pain, she found that much of the content relied upon behavioural interventions  but research in other population shows that its just as important to address beliefs and attitudes about sleep. Maybe this is an area to focus on a little more in pain management programmes also. Reference: Tang, N. (2009). Cognitive-behavioral therapy for sleep abnormalities of chronic pain patients.

 A Night Owl With Insomnia THE NEW YORK TIMES[/COLOR] August 20, 2010 Is tossing and turning until 3 a.m. a form of insomnia? Or could it be another disorder, requiring separate kinds of treatments? Dr. Shelby Freedman Harris and Dr. Michael Thorpy of Montefiore Medical Center respond to one night owl concerned about insomnia. Q. I am uncertain of the differentiation between delayed phase sleep syndrome and insomnia. Can one have both? Ive always been a night owl and have battled insomnia off and on all my life. Lately, with a stressful job, it is even more challenging to get a good nights sleep. What about melatonin? Im afraid of dependency on any drug and have avoided prescription meds. I do take melatonin and am looking for info on long-term effects. Thank you for the opportunity to post about this. Sammy, California A. Dr. Harris and Dr. Thorpy respond: Delayed sleep phase disorder and insomnia are two different disorders. Patients with delayed sleep phase disorder, or D.S.P.D., usually have difficulty falling asleep, but once they fall asleep they have no difficulty obtaining a full nights sleep and typically sleep until late morning or early afternoon. Those with insomnia, on the other hand, may have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, wake too early or feel that sleep is not restorative. Most insomnia patients have a combination of these symptoms, such as difficulty falling asleep as well as staying asleep. Insomnia is also usually due to some specific cause, such as a medical or psychiatric disorder like depression. Our bodies are biologically programmed, through circadian rhythms, to sleep at night and be alert during the day. In some people, these rhythms can shift, causing sleep and wake times to fall outside a desired schedule. In delayed sleep phase disorder, the sleep cycle is pushed later into the night, with a delayed natural morning wake time. Many patients with delayed sleep phase disorder consider themselves night owls. Its common for us to delay our sleep and wake times because of late-night parties and other social activities, but this does not mean we have the disorder. People with delayed sleep phase disorder are unable to return to a normal schedule, despite trying, and end up spending a prolonged time in bed awake before falling asleep. If you are able to fall asleep easily on resuming a normal bedtime after a few late nights, then you do not have delayed sleep phase disorder. An opposite but similar condition, called advanced sleep phase disorder, is commonly seen in older adults. This disorder occurs when a patient falls asleep earlier than desired but awakens very early in the morning after getting a full nights sleep. The patient, in this case, has great difficulty staying awake later into the night. We commonly see delayed sleep phase disorder in young teenagers, whose circadian rhythm naturally shifts from a bedtime of 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. to as late as 11 p.m. or midnight during adolescence. Teenagers may need as much as 9 or 10 hours of sleep a night but often need to awaken early in the morning for school. As a result, they are often sleep-deprived and tired during the day. A current line of research suggests there should be later school start times for teenagers, with earlier school times reserved for younger children. Teenagers respond and do better in school when learning during biologically optimal times. Although delayed bedtimes are fairly normal in adolescents, treatment for D.S.P.D. should be sought if it is causing significant difficulties with morning awakening, excessive daytime sleepiness, irritability or attention and concentration problems and does not easily respond to an earlier bedtime. There is often some confusion in the diagnosis of delayed sleep phase disorder, since the condition can easily look like a form of insomnia. For example, we often see patients in our practice who are told they have typical insomnia and do not fall asleep until 3 a.m., thereby obtaining only three to four hours of sleep per night. However, when asked how they sleep on the weekend or on vacations without any restrictions on wake time, they obtain seven or eight hours with no problem; for example, they may sleep from 3 a.m. until 11 a.m. Understanding the difference between delayed sleep phase disorder and insomnia is important, as the treatments are very different. Insomnia disorders can be treated behaviorally, often in combination with hypnotics or other medications or treatment of the underlying medical or psychiatric disorder. Delayed sleep phase disorder usually requires juggling several different specific treatments; seeking out the help of a sleep specialist can prove very beneficial. One option for delayed sleep phase disorder is chronotherapy. In this treatment, the patient delays the sleep period later and later every day by two to three hours until the bedtime and waking time eventually come fully around to the desired times. Chronotherapy can be an effective treatment for some, but it has its limitations when it comes to practicality, as it requires the patient to spend a few days sleeping during the day and being awake all night. The patient needs to limit all activities as well as light and noise during the protected sleep periods. Another very effective option is bright light therapy, which is given in the morning for delayed sleep phase disorder. This requires the patient to sit in bright light for an hour at a time. Sunlight can be highly effective, though many choose to use an indoor light box for convenience, particularly on cloudy days or in the winter. It is advisable to seek the help of a sleep specialist, since use of bright light at the wrong time of day can actually worsen the problem. Finally, melatonin, a natural hormone made by the bodys pineal gland, is also effective in treating circadian rhythm disorders, including delayed sleep phase disorder and jet lag. Melatonin is usually used in combination with behavioral and sometimes other pharmacological treatments. In cases of delayed sleep phase disorder that are difficult to resolve, we often have to use three or four different treatment options at the same time in order to help the patient. Though many people also use melatonin for insomnia, it is usually not very effective for that condition. The pineal gland is inactive during the day, but when the sun goes down, it becomes active and begins to naturally produce melatonin. Melatonin is commonly sold in health food stores and pharmacies as an over-the-counter dietary aid (since it is naturally found in some foods) and is not currently regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. As a result, listed doses and ingredients may not be completely accurate. Melatonin has documented side effects, including daytime sleepiness, headaches, confusion, dizziness, abdominal pain, sleepwalking and nightmares. It can also have a negative interaction with certain medications, including blood thinners, diabetes medicines, immunosuppressants and birth control pills. We also advise that you seek the help of a sleep specialist when considering using melatonin, since taking the wrong dose of melatonin at the wrong time of day can adversely affect your circadian rhythms. Smaller doses (0.5 milligrams) are typically given earlier in the evening to gradually pull the circadian drive earlier, therefore allowing for earlier bed and wake times. 
 Less Sleep Linked to Blues in Teens By Jordan Lite, Scientific American Mind July 2010 Earlier bedtimes set by parents protect against depression Despite kids protests, enforcing early bedtimes may be good for their mental health. Teens who are allowed to go to bed later are more likely to suffer from depressionprobably for the simple reason that they are not getting enough sleep, a recent study suggests. Columbia University scientists found that depression was 24 percent more common in teens whose parents let them go to bed at midnight or later than in kids whose moms and dads required them to hit the pillow by 10 p.m. The night owls were also 20 percent more likely to have suicidal thoughts. Teens with bedtimes of midnight or later got an average of seven and a half hours of sleep, whereas those with a lights-out of 10 p.m. or earlier got an average of eight hours and 10 minutes. Although the association between later bedtimes and depression was greater before controlling for parents marital status and poverty level, it remained statistically significant after taking those things into ac*countas well as teens perceptions of how much their parents cared about them. The researchers looked at parent-enforced bedtimesas opposed to simply logging hours sleptto rule out the possi*bility that depression was causing some kids to sleep less, rather than the other way around. Earlier work supports the idea that too little sleep may lead to depression. Research at the University of London showed that children who suffer from insomnia are at increased risk of developing depression in their tweens and teens. And a University of Pittsburgh study of youth at risk for hereditary depression found that the one biological predictor of resiliencein other words, not getting de*pressedwas adequate sleep. Although too little sleep is unlikely to be solely responsible for a teens low mood, in those with a genetic or environmental predisposition sleep loss may raise risk and satisfying rest may be protective. Recent studies at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the University of California, Berkeley, are starting to tease out why. During brain scans, sleep-deprived but otherwise healthy people showed increased activity in the amygdala (the brains emotional center) and decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex (an area that puts our experiences in context, and by extension, makes us rational)the same changes seen in people who are depressed. In one army study, subjects started to show symptoms of depression, and the Berkeley subjects became more distressed than rested participants when confronted with upsetting images. All these neurobiological effects may hit teens especially hard, says psychologist William D. Scott Killgore of Har*vard Medical Schoolaffiliated McLean Hospital, a co-author of the army research. As teens cope with increasingly com*plicated daily life, they need more sleep than younger kids or adults, Killgore explains, and so not getting enough sleep is especially problematic. 
 Hi I'm a 23 year old female and for the past year I have had a tiredness problem. It wasn't that bad a year ago but gradually with time it has worsened by a lot. I find myself unable to get up for college in mornings (i have morning classes but because of my problem have changed them to afternoon classes for next semester). When I don't have college I sleep in a lot and even around 1 or 2 in the afternoon I have trouble getting up. I often find that my body feels very pysically weak. When I wake up from sleep or taking a nap my body feels too weak that it is hard to get up. I haven't been working out as much because of this problem of my body feeling weak. I get a lot of sleep in the night, at least 8 hours of sleep. Although I have had this problem for a while I have just recently gotten help for it. I went to a sleep clinic in the hospital and they schedualed me for an overnight sleep study and daytime study. I just got the results but I have to wait until the end of august to see what the results mean. The results didn't really help me too much because I was unable to really understand them. The thing I noticed that was wrong was that it said I had abnormal sleep architecture. I am struggling with this problem and I'm afraid that when I go back to the hospital they are going to tell me that they think nothing is wrong. I know that something is wrong and it has been affecting my mood, school, my relationships and how my day goes. Today I was really upset because I slept a lot during the day, not to mention I missed class because I had trouble getting out of bed and eventually fell back to sleep. This problem is really affecting how I feel every day and I feel like I need to be taken more seriously. What if I go to the hospital for my appointment at the end of august and they tell me they think nothing is wrong? I know something is wrong but I'm not sure exactly what. I'm sick of struggling with it and it's causing me to be depressed. I'm scared this problem is affecting a lot of things in my life and I don't know what exactly is wrong with me. Lately I've been feeling dizzy, throwing up and have been feeling sick to my stomach. So not only is the sleepiness problem a problem with my health but other things have been going on too! But the tiredness problem is really bothering me and I slept most of the day today because of it and missed class. If anyone could help me out I'd appreciate it. 
 I've just woken up this morning and have been seriously affected by a dream I had. The dream in itself, was actually a positive one (even though the theme wasn't a nice one), it felt so real and on top of that, unlike any dream I have ever had. My grandmother was in my dream, who passed away 5 years ago or so, but it felt like she was REALLY there in the dream and/or she was at least really connected to me somehow whilst I was dreaming about her and she was trying to make closure for me on what had happened with her at the end of her life. I woke up with my pillow soaking wet as I was physically crying in my sleep and my heart beating so fast and feeling nauseous, I had to lay there for 10 minutes before it would slow down at all and before I felt OK to get up. Shame I woke up feeling bad because the dream itself was a pretty positive one. I've never woken up from a dream feeling bad physically, but several times in the past, I've really had a hard time the next day to shrug off the dream and it keeps going around and around in my head all day long. Hopefully I can succeed today in not letting it affect me too much. 
 Chronic insomnia may shorten your life: study CTV News Tuesday June 8, 2010 People who suffer from chronic insomnia appear to die prematurely, regardless of any other chronic conditions they have, such as heart disease or diabetes, a new study has found. The research was presented at SLEEP 2010, the annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, by Laurel Finn, a biostatistician at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Her team analyzed data on people enrolled in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study who completed two to three mailed questionnaires in 1989, 1994, and 2000. Anyone who reported insomnia symptoms in at least two of the questionnaires was considered to have had insomnia. The researchers looked at four types of insomnia: difficulty falling asleepdifficulty getting back to sleepwaking repeatedlywaking too earlyThey then looked at a Social Security death index search and found there were 128 deaths among the 2,242 participants. While calculating how insomnia raises the risk of premature death, they adjusted their figures for a number of factors, including body mass index, age and sex, as well as for self-reported medical conditions such as chronic bronchitis, heart attack, stroke, hypertension, diabetes and depression. Even after making those adjustments, they found that overall, the risk of dying was about three times higher among people with chronic insomnia than among people who did not have insomnia. The risks were slightly higher among those who chronically woke too early, and among those who had trouble getting back to sleep, but overall the risk of early death was elevated regardless of the type of insomnia. "The most surprising result was the increased high risk for mortality among individuals with chronic insomnia versus those without insomnia, even after adjustment for all of the potential confounding variables" said lead author Finn. "The other important finding was the non-differentiation between subtypes of insomnia with respect to mortality risk." Finn added that the results emphasize the need for physicians to provide effective treatments for insomnia even if patients don't have other health problems that put them at risk of a premature death. "Insomnia is a burdensome symptom and has a negative impact on sleep quality that may lead people to seek treatment," said Finn. "The identification of insomnia as a mortality risk factor may have clinical implications and raise the priority level for insomnia treatment." The study was supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; the National Institute on Aging; and the National Center for Research Resources. According to Statistics Canada, an estimated 3.3 million Canadians aged 15 or older, or about one in every seven, have chronic problems going to sleep or staying asleep. The study found that about one in five of these people average less than five hours of sleep a night. The StatsCan study found that middle-aged people (ages 45 to 64) had high odds of suffering from insomnia, as did people who were widowed, and those with low education. Weight was also a factor. High proportions of people who were obese suffered from insomnia. And the heavier they were, the more likely they were to have trouble sleeping. The study also found that heavy weekly drinking was linked to insomnia, as was frequent use of cannabis. 
 'Sexsomnia' may be more common than thought CTV News Monday June 7, 2010 Is it possible to have sex while fully asleep? Canadians researchers say yes and that it happens a lot more frequently than many may have thought. Toronto researchers say their research at a sleep disorders centre found that 7.6 per cent of patients engaged in sexsomnia, initiating or engaging in sexual activity with a partner while asleep. The rate was nearly three times higher in men than women -- about 11 per cent in men, and 4 per cent in women. The researchers want to make it clear that while those numbers sound quite high, it should be stressed that they only studied patients referred to a sleep clinic. "So, we would expect the numbers to be much lower in the general population," noted one of the study's co-investigators, Sharon A. Chung, a Sleep Research Laboratory staff scientist in the department of psychiatry at the University Health Network in Toronto. The researchers say this is the first study to examine the prevalence of sexsomnia among those suffering from sleep disorders. Chung's team reviewed charts of 832 patients who suffered from suspected sleep disorders. The 428 men and 404 women filled out questionnaires about their symptoms, behaviours during sleep, fatigue and mood. They found that almost 8 per cent of the patients suffered from sexsomnia. The disorder left them with fatigue, insomnia and depressed mood. It's not known what causes sexsomnia, but it's thought that fatigue and sleep deprivation are factors, as are alcohol consumption and stress. While those patients reporting sexsomnia reported similar rates of smoking and caffeine consumption as other patients at the sleep disorders centre, "sexsomniacs" were twice as likely to admit using illicit drugs (15.9 per cent vs. 7.7 per cent). The researchers also found that while sexsomnia was relatively common, patients rarely mentioned the problem to their doctor. Chung noted that only four of 832 patients expressed a complaint about sexsomnia during a consultation with a sleep specialist. "It seems that patients generally don't discuss this with their doctors," she said. The research was presented Monday at SLEEP 2010, the 24th annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies in San Antonio, Texas. The research has not yet been published or peer-reviewed. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, published in 2005 by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, sexsomnia appears to occur predominantly during "confusional arousals" and may occur during an episode of sleepwalking. "Confusional arousals" usually happen without the sleeping person coming to consciousness. If the person isn't woken during the event, they usally have no memory of it happeaning. Sexsomnia can be treated, often by treating the cause of the sleep disturbances. That might mean eliminating alcohol or drugs, or avoiding shift work. Some patients also suffer from sleep apnea, and when that condition is treated, the sexsomnia ends. There are also medications available, such as bedtime benzodiazepines. One of the most well-known cases of sexsomnia in Canada involved a man named Jan Luedecke, who was charged with sexually assaulting a woman at a 2003 house party in Toronto. He was found not criminally responsible after court heard testimony that Luedecke suffered from sexsomnia. Four previous girlfriends testified that Luedecke had engaged in "sleep sex" with them prior to the assault. He also testifed that the day before the assault, he had taken magic mushrooms and had been drinking heavily in the hours leading up to the assault. He was also overworked, stressed and sleep-deprived, which are believed to be triggers for sexsomnia. The trial judge acquitted Luedecke on the grounds the he could not have formed the intent to commit the assault, while also concluding that his condition did not qualify as a "disease of the mind." 
 The Link Between Depression and Dreams by Ryan Hurd September 15, 2009 Sleep plays a major role in mood regulation; thats a truism that is behind every mothers call for time to go to bed! But while the links between dreams and depression are well documented, the role of dreams in maintaining mental health is still one of the most confusing components in the function of sleep. In the 1970s, psychologists noted that people suffering from depression also report more dreams than average. In fact, people who are clinically depressed may dream three or four times as much. The quality of REM dreams (also called paradoxical sleep) is different too: more intense emotions, more negative themes, more nightmares, and more unpleasant dreams, in general. Its insult on top of injury that these unpleasant dreams are often mixed with insomnia and less slow-wave sleep: that deep sleep that leaves us feeling restored and refreshed. Rather than waking up refreshed, the clinically depressed dreamer wakes up feeling like he has been in battle all night long and now has to get up and do it again in waking life. Are Nightmares Harmful or Beneficial? The correlation between dreams and depression has led to shifts in thinking about the value of dreams. Some psychologists believe that REM dreams actually makes depression worse. This is a growing trend in neuroscience, fueling the search for the perfect pill that can eliminate nightmares. This approach has some merit, especially for sufferers of Post Tramatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). For example, medications like Prazosin, originally prescribed for high blood pressure, reduce adrenaline and reduce the nightmares that plague PTSD sufferers. However, success with highly traumatized patients has led other researchers to envision an anti-sleeping pill for anyone who wants to have less sleep (and less dreams as a bonus). Given that we dont completely understand the function of dreams,  or even of sleep for that matter  I think this is an alarming trend. Indeed, the age-old belief that nightmares act as a tension-reducing mechanism is under fire, as recent finding suggest that nightmares often add to anxiety (Roberts et al., 2009). This does not necessarily mean that nightmares are bad for us. Instead, consider the idea that nightmares may induce tension, giving dreamers a chance to confront their emotions head-on, both in the dream and later in waking life. Whether this is beneficial depends on the dreamers anxiety level, the life situation, and the cultural preparation for this level of dreamwork. The Chemistry of Dreams A critical perspective to remember is that depression involves irregularities in brain chemistry. And as Allan Hobson has argued for thirty years, dreams are also a chemical event, and are deeply affected by modulations in the brains neurotransmitters. During REM sleep, acetycholine and its regulators dominate the scene while serotonin is depressed. As Hobson explains in his classic The Chemistry of Conscious States, this is why dreams may be so overwhelmingly negative. Hobson notes that three emotions dominate in dreams: anxiety, anger and elation. In other words, the odds are against you for having a good dream in the first place. Are dreams depressed by nature? He writes, These emotions could fit into the depressive spectrum, but in dreams, the aminergic [dopamine and noradrenaline] deficit is acute and restored immediately upon waking. Depression takes days or weeks to develop. So, metaphorically, we can even say that dreams and depression are like bird on a wire, sharing many of the same cognitive attributes. The Irony of Insomnia A common treatment of depression today are SSRIs (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors), which increase serotonin levels and elevate moods. Indirectly, this also decreases REM sleep. Sometimes this is a good thing, because the respite from bad dreams is a nice bonus when added to a more restful nights sleep. However, some patients have noticed that SSRIs can increase their nightmares and give them more bizarre dreams. Note that SSRIs are great for combating sleep paralysis, a peculiar form of REM sleep disturbance that often leads to hypnagogic hallucinations or lucid nightmares that feel like being held down by some unseen entity. So when looking for treatment options for depression, its recommended to tell the doctor about the insomnia and the bad dreams, because some of the popular antidepressants will just make these symptoms worse. Relatedly, sometimes getting less sleep can improve certain kinds of depression. This is almost as paradoxical as paradoxical sleep. Controlled sleep deprivation was a common technique suggested by psychologists, but the advent of modern anti-depressant medications took center stage when introduced in the late 1980s. Dreams and Depression in Perspective Stepping back, its clear that dreams and depression are entwined on many levels. Depth psychologists, such as James Hillman and Marie von Franz, have said just as much in their mythological pairing of dreams with depression, death, and the afterlife. Hillman scathingly writes of Western cultures unexplored link between these associations: The dream takes us downward, and the mood that corresponds with this movement is the slowing, saddening, introspective feeling of depression. This depression has many faces we need incantations to help us drop off to sleep, a ritual of prayer, toothbrushing and the teddy bear, of masturbation, food cramming, and the late show, of night cap and sleeping pill. The basic bedtime story of our culture is that to sleep is to dream and to dream is to enter the House of the Lord of the Dead, where our complexes lie in wait. We do not go gentle into that good night (p. 35)What Hillman is getting at is a natural predilection of dreams towards the darker, broodier, and unpleasant aspects of living, an observation made as early as the ancient Greeks and demonstrated scientifically through modern content analysis. Yet as a culture we no not give credence to our dark dreams, or provide guidance for those who suffer from them more than others. By making these connections clear, we make a little more room for our depressive human natures, and hope can find some real ground to stand on. Source Roberts, J., Lennings, C., & Heard, R. (2009).

 One author's quest for a solid night of sleep by Wency Leung, Globe and Mail Thursday, June 03, 2010 Sleep is not an open-and-shut state, a long-time insomniac discovered once she began researching her own disorder. Depending on whether you listen to a psychotherapist, a mattress retailer or a drug manufacturer, youll get a different bedtime story Try as she might, Patricia Morrisroe couldnt sleep. So the New York writer decided to become an expert on her sleep disorder. Her quest for a solid night of shut-eye involved sleep labs, hypnotherapists, psychiatrists, pharmaceuticals, mattress shopping, and a chilly stay at Swedens famous Icehotel. She documented her research in the new book Wide Awake: A Memoir of Insomnia. It seems sleep should be the most natural thing in the world; if youre tired, you sleep. How do you describe what its like to suffer from insomnia? Its a lack of control. Its not as though you can get into bed and have a respite. Its always the possibility that youre going to be waking up in the middle of the night, and all the thoughts from the day can invade you. So its almost as though theres no end of the day. At the sleep lab where you were monitored for a night, you were told your sleep patterns are abnormal, that you dont reach a deep sleep stage. Well, theyre only abnormal in that I was in an abnormal situation in a lab. I mean, thats the ridiculous thing. Im very, very sensitive to my environment. There was no way I was going to sleep in that crummy sleep lab. It was depressing staying on a floor of a seemingly vacant hospital. There was the sleep technician right outside the door, who said to me, If in the middle of the night, the wires and things come unattached, Ill come into your room and reattach them. They did come unattached, and I was awake, so it really didnt matter. But that pattern bore no relationship to the way I sleep whatsoever. So to my mind, it was utterly useless. One of the big questions you raise is: We spend tens of billions of dollars a year on products and services related to sleep, but are we throwing our money away? I think in some instances we are. Theres no coincidence that the focus on sleep really started in the early 1990s when [pharmaceutical company] Searle came out with the sleeping drug Ambien. Searle teamed up with the National Sleep Foundation and another public relations agency to do this poll, Sleep in America. And all of a sudden, the focus was on how Americans are sleeping, how were not getting enough sleep, and so forth. And there really was not a lot of hardcore evidence that we were sleeping any less than we were previously. Clinical trials show that sleeping pills only keep people asleep overall during the night for 11 minutes. Thats not a lot. They can also interfere with memory formation, so sometimes you may think youve been sleeping better than you did, but you just dont remember you were awake. Are sleeping pills more harmful than sleep deprivation? I think they can be for elderly people. The night of my book party in New York, my mother, who I mention in the book and has insomnia  shes almost 90, she woke up, having taken an Ambien, and fell and really injured her shoulder. I have broken my toe twice when Ive taken Ambien. On one hand, you have doctors and specialists telling you to take pills, keep sleep diaries, do cognitive behavioural therapy exercises, and so forth. On the other, you have doctors and specialists telling you to cut that all out. That different people simply have different sleep needs and patterns. Whos right? I think different people have different sleep needs and patterns. We think of sleep as the way Westerners sleep. Carol Worthman, an anthropologist at Emory University, says its the lie down and die model, where you get into bed and thats it for eight hours. Shes done some research into traditional, non-Western societies and for them, sleep is much more fluid. They sleep when theyre bored or theyre tired. Or something excitings happening and it may be 3 a.m., but theyll be up. So I think we arent made necessarily to sleep in a solid block. What did you learn about sleep at the Icehotel? I learned that there was no way I could sleep on an ice bed.  But on Christmas, my husband and I went on this sleigh ride and I was interested in speaking with our Sami guide  Sami are the aboriginal people of Lapland  about what its like to sleep during the polar nights and the midnight sun. And he told me  it sounds almost cliché but  the idea of keeping with nature. For them, if its dark most of the day, you sleep 10 hours. During the midnight sun when its bright, maybe you sleep five hours. A bizarre area of sleep research that you touch on is disorders of arousal. Can you explain? When I first decided to do this book, it was 2006 and what was in the news tremendously were all these people who had been taking Ambien and would wake up in the middle of the night. Theyd go into their refrigerator and would grab these pieces of meat and be eating it like grizzly bears or theyd wake up with potato chips all over their beds. Ambien had somehow triggered that, but also a lot of these people were prone to being sleepwalkers, which is very common when youre younger. Or you can have REM disorder, when people act out their dreams. Then theres the whole issue of sexsomnia, where people have sex with their partners and they dont remember it later. A lot of strange stuff happens. Did any of the experts actually give you a good explanation for why you werent sleeping? You know, the psychoanalyst will say I wake up in the middle of the night because I want to REM-deprive myself; Im afraid of my dreams. A cognitive behavioural therapist might say Im watching TV in the bedroom, so Im not associating my bed simply with sleep and sex. Everybody sees it through their own specialty. For me, I think a lot of it is, No. 1, who I am, and No. 2, theres no question that sleep falls off as you age. [Ms. Morrisroe is 59.] Sleep develops wrinkles, as it were. How has meditation finally helped you? It did help my sleep a lot. Having said that, is meditation a [solution] if you have chronic insomnia? No. But I think meditation gave me a sense of control. 
 Lack of sleep: Can it make you sick? by Timothy Morgenthaler, M.D. Mayo Clinic April 2010 Question: I'm having trouble sleeping lately. Does this increase my chances of getting sick? Answer: Yes, lack of sleep can affect your immune system. Studies show that people who don't get a good night's sleep or who don't get enough sleep are more likely to get sick after being exposed to a virus, such as the common cold. Lack of sleep can also affect how fast you recover if you do get sick. During sleep, your immune system releases proteins called cytokines. These substances increase in the presence of an infection, inflammation and stress. Increased cytokines are necessary in fighting infection and regulating deeper sleep. In addition, other infection-fighting cells are reduced during periods of sleep deprivation. So, your body needs sleep to fight infectious diseases. How much sleep do you need to bolster your immune system? The optimal amount of sleep for most adults is seven to eight hours a night. School-aged children and adolescents need nine or more hours of sleep a night. But be careful; more sleep is not always better. For adults, sleeping more than nine to 10 hours a night has been associated with weight gain, heart problems, stroke, sleep disorders, depression and other health concerns. 
 How Your Computer Makes You Stay Awake at Night and How to Stop it (I installed the monitor-adjusting software and I feel sleepy already ) 
 The majority of my nightmares dreams i do not even remember or know i have had one. It is my husband who says to me i had terrible dreams all night kept him awake yelling in my sleep screaming then go back to sleep. Why if the dream or nightmare is so traumatic can i not recall any of it Why is it i don't even know i have had one. 
 Raiding the Refrigerator, but Still Asleep By RANDI HUTTER EPSTEIN, New York Times April 7, 2010 Shirley Koecheler, 54, has been a sleepwalker for as long as she can remember. But it wasnt until she got married that she started eating in her sleep, too. Shed wander into the kitchen  eyes open but asleep  and binge on junk food. Like so many of those with sleep-related eating disorder, Ms. Koecheler, a businesswoman and farmer from Maple Plains, Minn., does not remember anything about her nighttime journeys. When she wakes up the next morning to a crumb-filled bed, uncomfortably full, she knows that she must have spent feasting. Ive gained seven pounds in the past two months, Ms. Koecheler said. I bought the Easter candy for the kids and had my husband hide it, but I must have found it during the night. I found the wrappers in the wastebasket from the solid chocolate bunnies. Sleep eaters make a beeline for the kitchen and tend to binge on sugary, high-calorie snacks, sometimes five times a night, said Dr. John W. Winkelman, medical director of the Sleep Health Center of Brigham and Womens Hospital in Brighton, Mass. Some go for bizarre food combinations like peanut butter and pasta, and even the occasional nail polish or paper. Consequences of nighttime eating can include injuries like black eyes from walking into a wall or hand cuts from a prep knife, or dental problems from gnawing on frozen food. On a deeper level, many sleep eaters feel depressed, frustrated and ashamed. Upwards of 10 percent of adults suffer from some sort of parasomnia, or sleep disorder, like sleepwalking or night terrors. Some have driven cars or performed inappropriate sexual acts  all while in a sleep-induced fog. About 1 percent, mostly women, raid the refrigerator. No one knows what triggers these nocturnal escapades, but recent research offers a glimmer of light into the basic biology. And while there are no cures, some medications are showing promise for helping sufferers sleep more soundly. Oddly enough, sleeping pills do not help  the sedative Ambien, in fact, has been known to trigger or exacerbate the problem. In Sleep Runners, a 2004 documentary about parasomnias, 75-year-old Rowena Pope of Circle Pines, Minn., recalls how one night her usually gentle husband, Cal, began pummeling me and kicking me violently. I shook him and awakened him, and he had no idea what he was doing. Dr. Carlos H. Schenck, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Minnesota and the films producer, said that violence during the night does not signify lurking aggression. Similarly, eating during sleep does not necessarily signal a daytime eating disorder, though sleep eating may be more common among people with disorders like binge eating or anorexia. Sadly, many sleep eaters and others with related disorders suffer for years without telling their doctors because they consider it a personality quirk rather than a medical disorder. They may try all sorts of remedies, from strapping themselves to the bed to hiding food, usually to little or no avail. Others worry theyll be labeled with a mental illness, a notion that mental health experts now dismiss. Those who exhibit violence during sleep, or scream, or swear, or masturbate, or eat frozen ravioli, or wander into the hallway in their underwear while asleep generally have no more of a psychological disorder than those who sleep peacefully every night, Dr. Schenck writes in his book Sleep: The Mysteries, the Problems and the Solutions (Penguin/Avery, 2007). I thought this was just the way I was, said Sarah Tracey, a 22-year-old radiation therapist and sleep eater from Canton, Mass. I usually get up four or five times a night. Ive been doing it since I was 11 or 12-ish. When she worried that her disturbed sleep would affect her job performance, she did what so many others do - she searched online, where she found an article about sleep eating as well as an ongoing study about the disorder. It was a huge relief to realize that its a real condition and Im not being crazy. Scientists now divide parasomnias into two main groups, depending on whether or not they occur during the rapid eye movement, or REM, phase of sleep, when dreaming occurs. About 0.5 percent of adults, mostly men, have a rare condition called REM sleep behavior disorder that causes violent thrashing during sleep. There are other REM disorders, including nightmare disorder, marked by horribly disturbing dreams. One of the most terrifying parasomnias, Dr. Schenck said, is sleep paralysis, which really does not fit into either of the main categories. It hits people as they are about to fall asleep or are about to wake up, rendering them unable to move. Clonazepam, an anticonvulsant and anti-anxiety medication, helps up to 90 percent of people with REM sleep behavior disorder, though it makes some people drowsy the following day. Cal Pope, the sleep thrasher in the parasomnia documentary, has taken the pills successfully for years, though Dr. Schenck cautions that when people stop taking the drug, even for a few days, the sleep violence can return immediately. Recent evidence also suggests that REM sleep behavior disorder may be an early harbinger of Parkinsons disease or other neurodegenerative disorders linked to defects in the dopamine system in the brain. These clues have prompted some experts to use drugs like pramipexole (Mirapex) that boost dopamine levels to treat people who thrash in their sleep. In a small study published in Sleep Medicine, Dr. Markus H. Schmidt, the medical director of the Ohio Sleep Medicine Institute, found that pramipexole helped nine of 10 volunteers. Non-REM sleep disorders include the sleep eaters and those with so-called sexsomnia, in which people can hurt themselves from violent masturbation or injure their bed partner with aggressive sexual behavior, all done in a sleep-like state. Unlike REM sleep behavior disorder, non-REM sleep disturbances occur when the patient is not dreaming, and their eyes may be open. As Dr. Schmidt put it, they are in a kind of no-mans land,. not fully awake nor fully asleep. Small studies have suggested that topiramate (Topamax), a drug used to treat epilepsy, helps about two-thirds of patients with sleep-related eating disorders, though many cannot tolerate side effects like clouded thinking and tingling in the hands and feet. Dr. Winkelman is enrolling patients in a larger trial of the drug. Many sleep eaters also suffer from restless leg syndrome, a common condition in which people feel an uncontrollable urge to move the legs when going to sleep. Drugs that boost dopamine levels may help both conditions. One of the biggest stumbling blocks is that no one really understands what happens during sleep. As Dr. Winkelman explained, Sleep is not the absence of wake. Your brain is active all night long. People think wake is like a room with the lights on and sleep is like the same room in the dark, but in the darkness a lot is going on. 
 Why Do We Dream? Neuroskeptic Blog Wednesday, 7 April 2010 A few months ago, I asked Why Do We Sleep? That post was about sleep researcher Jerry Siegel, who argues that sleep evolved as a state of "adaptive inactivity". According to this idea, animals sleep because otherwise we'd always be active, and constant activity is a waste of energy. Sleeping for a proportion of the time conserves calories, and also keeps us safe from nocturnal predators etc. Siegel's theory in what we might call minimalist. That's in contrast to other hypotheses which claim that sleep serves some kind of vital restorative biological function, or that it's important for memory formation, or whatever. It's a hotly debated topic. But Siegel wasn't the first sleep minimalist. J. Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley created a storm in 1977 with The Brain As A Dream State Generator ; I read somewhere that it provoked more Letters to the Editor in the American Journal of Psychiatry than any other paper in that journal. Hobson and McCarley's article was so controversial because they argued that dreams are essentially side-effects of brain activation. This was a direct attack on the Freudian view that we dream as a result of our subconscious desires, and that dreams have hidden meanings. Freudian psychoanalysis was incredibly influential in American psychiatry in the 1970s. Freud believed that dreams exist to fulfil our fantasies, often though not always sexual ones. We dream about what we'd like to do - except we don't dream about it directly, because we find much of our desires shameful, so our minds disguise the wishes behind layers of metaphor etc. "Steep inclines, ladders and stairs, and going up or down them, are symbolic representations of the sexual act..." Interpreting the symbolism of dreams can therefore shed light on the depths of the mind. Hobson and McCarley argued that during REM sleep, our brains are active in a similar way to when we are awake; many of the systems responsible for alertness are switched on, unlike during deep, dreamless, non-REM sleep. But of course during REM there is no sensory input (our eyes are closed), and also, we are paralysed: an inhibitory pathway blocks the spinal cord, preventing us from moving, except for our eyes - hence why it's Rapid Eye Movement sleep. Dreams are simply a result of the "awake-like" forebrain - the "higher" perceptual, cognitive and emotional areas - trying to make sense of the input that it's receiving as a result of waves of activation arising from the brainstem. A dream is the forebrain's "best guess" at making a meaningful story out of the assortment of sensations (mostly visual) and concepts activated by these periodic waves. There's no attempt to disguise the shameful parts; the bizarreness of dreams simply reflects the fact that the input is pretty much random. Hobson and McCarley proposed a complex physiological model in which the activation is driven by the giant cells of the pontine tegmentum. These cells fire in bursts according to a genetically hard-wired rhythm of excitation and inhibition. The details of this model are rather less important than the fact that it reduces dreaming to a neurological side effect. This doesn't mean that the REM state has no function; maybe it does, but whatever it is, the subjective experience of dreams serves no purpose. A lot has changed since 1977, but Hobson seems to have stuck by the basic tenets of this theory. A good recent review came out in Nature Neuroscience last year, REM Sleep and Dreaming. In this paper Hobson proposes that the function of REM sleep is to act as a kind of training system for the developing brain. The internally-generated signals that arise from the brainstem (now called PGO waves) during REM help the forebrain to learn how to process information. This explains why we spend more time in REM early in life; newborns have much more REM than adults; in the womb, we are in REM almost all the time. However, these are not dreams per se because children don't start reporting experiencing dreams until about the age of 5. Protoconscious REM sleep could therefore provide a virtual world model, complete with an emergent imaginary agent (the protoself) that moves (via fixed action patterns) through a fictive space (the internally engendered environment) and experiences strong emotion as it does so.This is a fascinating hypothesis, although very difficult to test, and it begs the question of how useful "training" based on random, meaningless input is. While Hobson's theory is minimalist in that it reduces dreams, at any rate in adulthood, to the status of a by-product, it doesn't leave them uninteresting. Freudian dream re-interpretation is probably ruled out ("That train represents your penis and that cat was your mother", etc.), but if dreams are our brains processing random noise, then they still provide an insight into how our brains process information. Dreams are our brains working away on their own, with the real world temporarily removed. Of course most dreams are not going to give up life-changing insights. A few months back I had a dream which was essentially a scene-for-scene replay of the horror movie Cloverfield. It was a good dream, scarier than the movie itself, because I didn't know it was a movie. But I think all it tells me is that I was paying attention when I watched Cloverfield. On the other hand, I have had several dreams that have made me realize important things about myself and my situation at the time. By paying attention to your dreams, you can work out how you really think, and feel, about things, what your preconceptions and preoccupations are. Sometimes.

 I have been trying to search these forums and google for some people in my situation, but i cant seem to find the right words for any results i am looking for. Sleep,addiction,drug and many other words in any order come up with things like "Tired of addiction, lack of sleep" and that's not what I'm looking for. I will not go into a full life story, so in short my mother is in a wheelchair now and my father committed suicide a few years back. Since then i have done nothing but sit on my computer for twenty hours a day for the past 5 years. I have severed all ties to any friends/family outside my computer world so that i will not be interrupted or asked to take part in social events. This as you know takes years to do because people don't give up on you at first, but eventually they finally forget about you and leave you alone. Now that you know a little background i am wondering if anyone has heard of someone being addicted to lack of sleep. When i was brought up i was the one kid that actually took the advise about drugs and alcohol and waited a very long time to try either. Around 19 (i am 21 now) i tried both and i quickly learned that the aftermath (hangovers/Burnout) was not worth the fun i was told i had last night by my friends. Instead of things that potential hurt my lungs (im a runner) i stay up 20-48 hours straight in one place until my i am so tired that i become numb and at any time of my choosing i can pass out. Now this feeling, no freedom to sleep exactly when i want to is probably the best feeling i could have, better than weed,alcohol even sex. When i stay awake long enough i can get to the point where it feels exactly like i am on some type of heavy drug where i cant even remember the last few hours i was awake. One thing i am wondering is the affects this might have on my brain. 
 Why We Need to Dream By JONAH LEHRER in the New York Times March 19, 2010 When I cant sleep, I think about what Im missing. I glance over at my wife and watch her eyelids flutter. I listen to the steady rhythm of her breath. I wonder if shes dreaming and, if so, what story shes telling to herself to pass the time. (The mind is like a shark  it cant ever stop swimming in thought.) And then my eyes return to the ceiling and I wonder what I would be dreaming about, if only I could fall asleep. Why do we dream? As a chronic insomniac, I like to pretend that our dreams are meaningless narratives, a series of bad B-movies invented by the mind. I find solace in the theory that all those inexplicable plot twists are just random noise from the brain stem, an arbitrary montage of images and characters and anxieties. This suggests that Im not missing anything when I lie awake at night  there are no insights to be wrung from our R.E.M. reveries. Unfortunately for me, theres increasing evidence that our dreams are not neural babble, but are instead layered with significance and substance. The narratives that seem so incomprehensible  why was I running through the airport in my underwear?  are actually careful distillations of experience, a regurgitation of all the new ideas and insights we encounter during the day. Look, for instance, at the research of Matthew Wilson, a neuroscientist at the Picower Institute at M.I.T. In the early 1990s, Wilson was recording neuron activity in the brains of rats as they navigated a difficult maze. (The machines translated the firing of brain cells into loud, staccato pops.) One day, he left the rats connected to the recording equipment after they completed the task. (Wilson was preoccupied with some data analysis.) Not surprisingly, the tired animals soon started to doze off, slipping into a well-deserved nap. And thats when Wilson heard something extremely unexpected: although the rats were sound asleep, the sound produced by their brain activity was almost exactly the same as it was when they were running in the maze. The animals were dreaming of what theyd just done. Wilson has spent the last few decades following up on this important discovery. In a 2001 paper published in Neuron, Wilson and Kenway Louie described the behavior of rats that had been trained to run on a circular track. As expected, running on the track generated a distinct pattern of neural firing in the rat hippocampus, a brain area essential for the formation of long-term memory. This is learning at its most fundamental: a flurry of electric cells, trying to make sense of a space. Heres where things get interesting: as before, Wilson kept the electrodes in place while the rats drifted off to sleep. (The sleep of rats is very human, and consists of distinct stages, including R.E.M.) The scientists examined 45 dreams and found that 20 of the dreams repeated the exact same patterns of brain activity exhibited while running in a circle. In fact, the correlation between the dream and the reality was so close that Wilson could predict the exact position of the rodent on the track while it was asleep. They were decoding the dream as it was being dreamt. Why does the brain replay experience? Wilson and others argue that the dreaming rats are consolidating their new memories, embedding these fragile traces into the neural network. While were fast asleep, the mind is sifting through the helter-skelter of the day, trying to figure out what we need to remember and what we can afford to forget. So why are dreams so much more than literal playbacks of the day just passed? Why the non-sequiturs, the long forgotten characters and the unexplained state of public undress? Wilson speculates that dreams are also an attempt to search for associations between seemingly unrelated experiences, which is why its so important for the controlling conscious self to disappear. What does this maze have to do with that maze? How can we use the lessons of today to get more food pellets tomorrow? This suggests that the strangeness of our nighttime narratives is actually an essential feature, as our memories are remixed and reshuffled, a mash-up tape made by the mind. But wait: for the sleep- and dream-deprived, the news gets even worse. In recent years, scientists have discovered that R.E.M. sleep isnt just essential for the formation of long-term memories: it might also be an essential component of creativity. In a 2004 paper published in Nature, Jan Born, a neuroscientist at the University of Lübeck, described the following experiment: a group of students was given a tedious task that involved transforming a long list of number strings into a new set of number strings. This required the subjects to apply a painstaking set of algorithms. However, Born had designed the task so that there was an elegant shortcut, which could only be uncovered if the subjects saw the subtle links between the different number sets. When left to their own devices, less than 25 percent of people found the shortcut, even when given several hours to mull over the task. However, when Born allowed people to sleep between experimental trials, they suddenly became much more clever: 59 percent of all participants were able to find the shortcut. Born argues that deep sleep and dreaming set the stage for the emergence of insight by allowing us to mentally represent old ideas in new ways. Or look at a recent paper published by Sara Mednick, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego. She gave subjects a variety of remote-associate puzzles, which require subjects to find a word thats associated with three other seemingly unrelated words. (Heres a sample question: broken, clear and eye. The answer is glass.) Then, she instructed the subjects to take a nap. Interestingly, subjects who lapsed into R.E.M. during their nap solved 40 percent more puzzles than they did in the morning, before their brief sleep. (Subjects who quietly rested without sleeping or took a nap without R.E.M. showed a slight decrease in performance.) According to Mednick, the dramatic improvement in creativity is due to the fact that R.E.M. primes associative networks, allowing us to integrate new information into our problem-solving approach. While Freud would certainly celebrate this research  as he predicted, dreams have a psychological structure  which may be assigned to a specific place in the psychic activities of the waking state  its worth pointing out that the stories we invent while sleeping are much more practical than he imagined. For the most part, they dont reflect the unleashed id, full of unfulfilled sexual desires. Instead, we dream about what we think about: the mazes and mysteries of everyday life. All this knowledge about the important roles dreams play in our waking lives is fascinating. But it doesnt make me feel better about my insomnia. Obviously, my old consolation  dreams are nothing but useless melodramas  is clearly false. And though I eventually do fall asleep, lapsing into what I imagine is a rushed state of R.E.M., I cant help but be jealous of my wifes twitching eyelids at 2 a.m. She is busy remembering, processing, refreshing and I am merely awake.

 So I recently, after experiencing a very stressful week, have been absolutely dreading going to bed. And when I say dreading, I mean having some full blown panic attacks while lying in bed. The fear? It's this stupid cycle of: 1. Dreading having to go to bed all day long, trying to stretch the day out as long as possible 2. When bed time comes, thinking, 'I better fall asleep tonight, I just have to.....' 3. If some time (10 min usually) goes by I start to panic, insanely worrying that if I don't get sleep I will lose my mind or die or live in some sort of living hell due to being sleepy all the time. 4. Because of the increased pressure to sleep from #2 and the increased heart rate from #3, I indeed do NOT sleep. 5. I get out of bed after tossing and turning for hours, and feel incredibly alone, seeing that it is night, 2 or 3am, and I cannot go anywhere cause everything is closed, can't call anyone cause everyone is sleeping (but me), and my apartment walls start closing in on me, and I start feeling intense feelings of panic, isolation, loneliness, fear, and depression. 6. Eventually after hours upon hours of torturous (for me) insomnia, I actually do sleep, but, I wake up every 2-3 hours and often am eager to get out of the bed, thus ending up sleep deprived, because I'm just....afraid of my bed! 7. And back to #1 I seriously need to find a way out of this horrific cycle, so I would appreciate it if anyone could offer some advise regarding the situation, perhaps correct my thinking errors and the like. My heart sinks even now when I realize another hour has gone by and bedtime is going to come sooner than I expect. I should probably list here what sleep aids I use, and other things that might effect sleep: -I'm not drinking caffinated beverages anymore -I eat a moderately high sugar amount -My bedtime meds include: Lunesta 3mg, Robaxin 1500mg, Cyclobenzaprine 20mg, Xanax 1mg, Trazadone 50mg. -I generally use good sleep hygeine, bathing before bed, making my bed look comfy, not eating big meals before bed. -It should be noted I recently started taking Suboxone 4mg/day, speaking to my psychiatrist, he says it is typical the first few nights on the medication sleeplessness can occur, and sleeplessness is listed in the side effects (but I do have to take the med still.) -I don't drink alcohol -I do have chewing tobacco often -I barely exercise at all during the day (suboxone makes you rather lethargic) Thanks everyone, I know this may seem like a silly thing to get worked up about, but for me, it is very real, and very distressing. 
 Sleep deprivation affects the way we interpret emotional cues by Dennis Rosen, M.D. Psychology Today blog: Sleeping Angels March 2, 2010 Insufficient sleep makes it harder to "read" other people Much has been studied about how not getting enough sleep affect one's ability to function. Whether this is expressed in how one performs on tests measuring cognitive abilities, behavior, or even behind the wheel of a driving simulator (and responding worse than some whose blood alcohol levels exceed the legal limit), the results all support the premise that getting enough sleep is crucial if one wants to achieve one's full potential. Now, a new study published in the March issue of the journal SLEEP has found that sleep deprivation interferes with people's ability to distinguish between the facial expressions of others, specifically to determine whether they are happy or angry. In this study, 20 people were deprived of sleep for thirty hours, and then asked to look at photographs of faces, each displaying a different emotional state (happy, sad, and angry) at various levels of intensity. They were then allowed to sleep, and re-tested 24 hours later. The responses from both days were compared, as well as to those of another group of 17 people who served as controls, undergoing the same testing two days in a row without sleep deprivation. The researchers found that there was a significant blunting in the ability of those who had been tested while sleep deprived to distinguish between angry and happy facial expressions in the moderate intensity range. This difference disappeared after recovery sleep, and was greater in women than in men. What is the significance of these findings? First, they expose yet another area in which getting enough sleep is critical for normal daily function. One question they raise which I find especially intriguing is what this may mean for children (and adults) with autism, who by definition have difficulties interpreting social cues. It is known that the prevalence of sleep disorders in children with autism is much higher than in the general population, and so one could ask whether the sleep disturbances seen are solely a consequence of the autism, or whether they not only coexist, but also play a role in potentiating (or strengthening) some of autistic features? If that is the case, perhaps we should be more aggressive in treating sleep disorders in this population? While the numbers in this study were small, it certainly raises many important questions, which will no doubt continue to be looked at going forward. Reference van der Helm E; Gujar N; Walker MP.

 The Virtues of Napping Reader's Digest October 2009 Naptime isn’t just for kids. Studies show that taking a mid-afternoon siesta boosts productivity and improves overall health. Check out these great reasons to nap. Napping is Natural We all have a built-in, physiological desire for a nap in the afternoon. When researchers had volunteers spend time in an underground room with no clocks or clues as to day or night and told them to sleep whenever they wanted, the subjects slept in two cycles: a longer session at night and a shorter period—a nap—during the day. Fortunately, the myth that napping is wasted time may be changing, thanks to well-documented studies showing that short snoozes can improve mood, performance, and health. For example, nap-loving Latin Americans and Europeans usually score better on tests that measure stress than North Americans. What’s more, studies at the University of California at San Diego show that the sooner you can recover from modest sleep losses, the faster you restore your immune response to normal and the better you are at problem solving. Corporation Wakes Up Several studies, including one conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health, have found that short power naps increase concentration and counteract stress, another immune-system depressor. That may explain why people who nap are not only more productive at work, they are absent less often. Companies such as Nike, Ben & Jerry's have installed nap areas and encourage employees to use them. And ever since scientist Mark Rosekind, Ph.D., completed studies showing that pilots who take 40-minute sleep breaks on long flights fare better on vigilance, alertness, and decision-making tests, several European airlines now require their pilots to take time out for a mid-flight snooze. The National EMS Pilots Association NEMSPA is also recommending that emergency medical service pilots be allowed to sleep on duty. Napping for Shift Workers Naps also can improve health and most other aspects of life for the 2 million Canadians whose work schedules require them to be awake for night shifts or rotating shifts. Due to a preset morning waking mechanism in the body’s internal clock, many shift workers find it hard to sleep past noon even after an overnight shift. By supplementing their morning sleep with a 15- to 20-minute nap before leaving for work, they can minimize their level of sleep deprivation. A combination of naps and caffeine may provide the most benefits, according to a 2006 study at the Sleep Medicine and Research Center affiliated with St. John's Mercy Medical Center and St. Luke's Hospital in suburban St. Louis, MO. Researchers looked at the effectiveness of taking naps and consuming caffeine to cope with sleepiness during the night shift. They found that both naps and caffeine improved alertness and performance among night shift workers. James K. Walsh, PhD, one of the researchers who conducted the study, explains, "Because of the body's propensity for sleep at night, being alert and productive on the night shift can be challenging, even if you've had enough daytime sleep. Napping before work combined with consuming caffeine while on the job is an effective strategy for remaining alert on the night shift." So don't feel guilty, put your feet up and grab 20 winks before heading back to your inbox! 
 can anybody give me any pointers on this conditions and where i can go for a self test 
 An illusory interlude MindHacks October 28, 2009 I just found a some curious case reports on two people who had hallucinations in everyday life owing to unrecognised narcolepsy, but not realising it, they assumed their hallucinated episodes had genuinely occurred. Unlike in psychosis, where affected people often believe that their hallucinations are real, people who have narcolepsy and have hallucinations are usually able to realise they were triggered by the condition. In this case, the people were unaware that they had a tendency to hallucinate and so the boundaries between hallucination and reality began to blur. The 45-year-old technical manager had a multi-year history of daytime sleepiness... He frequently had curious experiences during the day  the neighbour throwing litter into the patient's bin; his wife throwing precious objects away. Sometimes he saw himself trying to clean dirt on the side of a ditch. These memories and experiences were confusing. They gave rise to a surprised and suspicious state of mind. Improbable and incomprehensible things happened, leaving him in doubt. Sometimes he gave sensitive-paranoid interpretations to the events, he also denounced the neighbour for filling his bin. His paranoidity drove his psychiatrist to the diagnostic conclusion of a delusional psychosis. Recently he had a severe conflict with his chief on account of a vivid experience of having had sexual intercourse with the chief's wife, which he mentioned to colleagues. Remembering every detail, he was convinced that his story was true, but the reactions of those around him gradually convinced him that this experience could be a hallucination.The man was eventually referred to a sleep clinic, diagnosed with narcolepsy and successfully treated. The other case is of a young woman who hallucinated that she had been sexually assaulted on a bus - an experience so vivid that she reported it to the police with numerous details of the offender. She later realised that that she could have been wrong and as part of the court case for making a false police report she was medically assessed and also diagnosed with narcolepsy after a sleep lab assessment. 
 Interpreting Dreams by Daniel R Hawes December 19, 2009 Sigmund Freud was convinced that dreams carry meaning, and that one of the pathways to revealing unconscious thoughts lays in the skillful interpretation of our nightly meanderings. For example, according to Freud's 1953 classic, The Interpretation of Dreams, dreams of flying through the air reveal subconscious thoughts of sexual desire, while dreams of failing to fly (i.e., falling) through the air reveals thoughts of...well ... eh... also sexual desire... Now, this little quip isn't quite fair, since Freud's classic book is of course more nuanced (e.g., falling represents succumbing to sexual desire), and being 692 pages in volume it also has much more to offer than simple impositions of sexual desire onto dream images. But anyway, what I am truthfully trying to get at is that even if I or you may look skeptically upon some of Freud's work on dreams, it remains that most people today share at least the underlying Freudian belief that dreams are indeed somewhat meaningful. Corroborating this, a survey of American, Korean and Indian students showed that an overwhelming majority of the sampled students entertained Freudian views of dreams as possessing meaningful interpretation, while only very few students supported competing scientific views of dreams as being either entirely meaningless by-products of random brain activity, or similar neurological derivative of creative problem-solving processes, memory or learning. Given that a belief about dreams as meaningful messages is deeply entrenched in global culture, through our religious texts, art and literature, it is not really surprising, that many people would entertain such Freudian views about dreams, but the finding does raise a couple of interesting questions as to how people might subsequently go about making sense of their dreams. For example, one might ask whether people are systematically biased as to how they interpret their dreams, or even towards which dreams they assign credence to in the first place. Or in terms of behavioral impact, we might ask whether a person who dreamed of a plane crash the night before embarking on a intercontinental flight, would be more or less inclined to step onto an airplane the following day, than a person who had a similar waking thought (for example, while reading a newspaper article about a plane crash)? These, and other interesting questions, lay at the heart of a series of studies, undertaken by researchers Carey Morewedge from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and Michael Norton from Harvard. As already mentioned depicted in the figures above (see original article), the two social scientists find that "laypeople [...] endorse [...] a general belief that dreams provide meaningful insight into both themselves and their world."Not unsurprisingly, Morewedge and Norton also note a general bias in the way people interpret their dreams. "[...] people's interpretation of the meaningfulness of any specific dream is impacted, by the extent to which that dream accords with their beliefs and desires when awake, and that these interpretations subsequently influence the impact of dreams on their diurnal (i.e., waking) lives.".For example, people who reportedly believe that dreams are generally meaningful, will nonetheless deem those dreams that they find to correspond with preexisting beliefs as far more meaningful than those which contradict preexisting beliefs and desires. In this sense, "Dreams about friends were deemed meaningful when those dreams reflected positively upon friends and were deemed less meaningful when they did not, whereas dreams about disliked individuals demonstrated the opposite pattern."And although, believers are of course much more willing to deem dreams about communications from God as meaningful, than are agnostics, agnostics nonetheless "were influenced by the extent to which dreams matched their secular desires, finding greater truth in God's commandments when those commandments entailed world travel rather than selfsacrifice."More generally, according to Morewedge and Norton, "when dreams reinforced and reflected (religious) beliefs that were important to perceivers, those dreams were considered to be meaningful regardless of the desirability of the dream content. When dreams did not reinforce or reflect beliefs that were important to perceivers, those dreams were considered to be less meaningful, particularly when the dream content conflicted with perceiver's preexisting worldly desires."While the above results are fairly intuitive, the next thing that Morewedge and Norton's study observed in their research might come as more of a surprise: As the study's authors point out, their research seem to indicate that "people do not merely lend the same amount of credence to thoughts that occur in dreams as thoughts that occur while awake but actually treat the content of their dreams as more meaningful than the content of similar waking thoughts."More specifically, when Morewedge and Norton looked at the impact of different messages regarding air travel, they actually found that dreaming of a plane crash seemed to exert greater influence on a person's imminent travel plans, than did news reports about similar tragedies or even official government warnings about travel security. In other words, a bad dream is more likely to make most people cancel a flight, than is a heightened security alert, or a news paper report about an airplane that crashed the night before. The psychological explanation for this observation is somewhat paradox, and appears to have a lot to do with the actual randomness of our dreams: It may very well be that the very fact that dreams often appear to be entirely random, leaves us with few other explanations than the conclusion that our dreams must have a higher meaning. Sticking with the example of air travel it seems to be the case that any fear about traveling by plane that follows, for example, a newspaper report can easily be dismissed as being a direct consequence of having read the news report. Hence, in the case of the news report, although we do perceive the information as meaningful, but since we find it so easy to identify the trigger for our fear response, we are quick to explain away any doubts about embarking on our travel plans, and thus remain fairly unaffected by the report. In a way, this kind of information processing is a direct attempt to avoid bias in our (waking) thoughts, caused by external stimuli, such as the newspaper report. A dream about an airplane crash on the other hand, which may appear to be rather random, makes it far more difficult, or even impossible at times, to identify a causal trigger for this particular (sleeping) thought, and thus we have a more difficult time dismissing this type of information information; especially so, when we hold the general belief that dreams are meaningful. As the study's lead author Carey Morewedge puts it "a decreased ability to trace dream content to an external source may lead people to give greater weight to that seemingly random information and increase the likelihood that it will impact subsequent judgments and behavior. Ironically, then, although the content of dreams often appears to be produced purely by random associations, which might make one expect that information to seem less meaningful, it may be the apparent randomness of those associations that makes people believe their dreams."This type of explanation finds further theoretical grounding in research on anchoring and attribution effects ; both of which the authors rely upon to formulate the hypotheses for their research. It is interesting in this context of laypeople's view of dreams, to note that scientific inquiries into the origin and purpose of dreams is a rapidly developing area of research, with newly emerging theories as well as competing hypotheses. For one, it seems clear that dreams play an integral role in learning and memory consolidation, and it is also well established that many creative processes, such as finding solutions to puzzles or mathematical problems, can be aided by rapid random associations we form during sleep. It also seems to be the case that we begin our dreaming phases with associations of thoughts and images we encountered during the day (try playing the computer game Tetris for a couple of hours, and you'll most likely begin your afternoon nap with the image of falling blocks), but that we quickly progress to different associations, which we can at the moment best describe as random. Whatever the case, it seems very unlikely that dreams should be able to predict future world events, such as e.g. an earthquake in a distant country (Although it is of course statistically almost certain - given that earth quakes happen, and billions of people dream each night - that some person, somewhere, will at some point of time have a dream of an earthquake in a distant country, precisely when the actual event occurs...). Nonetheless, because of the way that dreams are integrated in memory formation and creative associative problem solving, it is quite plausible that dreams may at time open our eyes to matters pertaining to our own life, which may have eluded our waking consciousness. Morewedge and Norton give the nice example, of a dream that integrates the seemingly unrelated evidence of "unexplained credit card charges, smudges of lipstick, distant behavior, into a correct diagnosis of infidelity".In the same way - and thereby providing the proverbial nod to Sigmund Freud -, the authors concede that dreams may actually also "provide insight into the concrete problem of making sense of ourselves as well".Main Reference Morewedge, C., & Norton, M.

 Night terrors By Mayo Clinic staff Aug. 15, 2009 Night terrors are episodes of fear, flailing and screaming while asleep. Night terrors often are paired with sleepwalking. Although night terrors are more common in children, they also can affect adults. A night terror episode usually lasts only a few minutes. Night terrors are relatively rare, affecting only a small percentage of children  often between ages 4 and 12  and a smaller percentage of adults. However frightening, night terrors aren't usually a cause for concern. Most children outgrow night terrors by adolescence. Symptoms Night terrors differ from nightmares. Whereas the dreamer of a nightmare wakes up from the dream and remembers details, people with night terrors remain asleep. Children usually don't remember anything about their night terrors in the morning. Adults may recall a dream fragment they had during the night terrors. Like sleepwalking and nightmares, night terrors are a parasomnia  an undesired occurrence during sleep. Night terrors usually occur during the first third of the sleep period for children. For adults, night terrors can happen anytime during the night. During a night terror episode, a person might: Sit up in bedScream or shoutKick and thrashSweat, breathe heavily and have a racing pulseBe hard to awakenGet out of bed and run around the house (more common in adults)Engage in violent behavior (more common in adults)Stare wide-eyed When to see a doctor Occasional night terrors aren't usually a cause for concern. If your child has night terrors, you can simply mention them at a routine well-child exam. Consult your doctor if your or your child's night terrors: Become more frequentRoutinely disrupt sleepCause you or your child to fear going to sleepLead to dangerous behavior or injuryAppear to follow the same pattern each time Causes Various factors can contribute to night terrors, including: Sleep deprivationFatigueStressAnxietyFeverSleeping in unfamiliar surroundings Night terrors sometimes are associated with underlying conditions that affect sleep, such as: Seizure disordersSleep-disordered breathing  a group of disorders characterized by abnormal breathing patterns during sleep, the most common of which is obstructive sleep apneaMigrainesStrokeHyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)Head injuries or brain swellingPremenstrual period In other cases, use of alcohol, illicit drugs or certain medications  including some antibiotics, antihistamines, sedatives and sleeping pills  can trigger night terror episodes. Risk factors Night terrors tend to run in families. Adults who have night terrors may have a history of bipolar disorder or some depressive or anxiety disorders, although it's unclear how strong the association is. Complications Night terrors aren't necessarily a concern, but regularly disrupted sleep can be. It can cause excessive daytime sleepiness, which can lead to difficulties at school or work, or problems with everyday tasks such as driving. Harming self or others is another possible complication during night terrors. Preparing for your appointment For children, night terrors tend to decrease by the time they're adolescents. However, if you have concerns about safety or underlying conditions for you or your child, you may want to consult your or your child's doctor, who may refer you to a sleep specialist. Your doctor also will need to know: When the night terrors beganHow often the night terrors occurYour medical historyAny medications you're taking or have takenWhether you have or have had any other sleep problemsWhether you have family members with sleep problems It's a good idea to keep a sleep diary for two weeks before your appointment to help your doctor understand your sleeping pattern. In the morning, you record as much as you know of your bedtime ritual, quality of sleep, and so on. At the end of the day, you record behaviors that may affect your sleep, such as caffeine consumption (chocolate and cola count) and any medications taken. The same applies to your child. Tests and diagnosis Night terrors are usually self-diagnosed. Your doctor may do a physical or psychological exam to identify any conditions that may be contributing to the night terrors. In some cases, observation or tests in an overnight sleep lab may be recommended. Treatments and drugs Treatment for night terrors isn't usually necessary. If your child has a night terror, simply wait it out. You might gently restrain your child and try to get him or her back into bed. Speak softly and calmly. Shaking your child or shouting may only make things worse. If the night terrors are associated with an underlying medical or mental health condition, treatment is aimed at the underlying problem. If stress or anxiety seems to be contributing to the night terrors, your doctor may suggest meeting with a therapist or counselor. Medication is rarely used to treat night terrors. If necessary, however, short-term use of benzodiazepines may help reduce night terrors. Lifestyle and home remedies If night terrors are a problem for you or your child, here are some things to try: Make the environment safe. To help prevent injury, close and lock all windows and exterior doors at night. You might even lock interior doors or place alarms or bells on the doors. Block doorways or stairways with a gate, and move electrical cords or other objects that pose a tripping hazard. If your child has night terrors, don't let him or her sleep in a bunk bed. Place any sharp or fragile objects out of reach.Get more sleep. Fatigue can contribute to night terrors. Try an earlier bedtime or a more regular sleep schedule.Establish a regular, relaxing routine before bedtime. Do quiet, calming activities  such as reading books, doing puzzles or soaking in a warm bath  before bed. Meditation or relaxation exercises may help, too.Put stress in its place. Identify the things that stress you out, and brainstorm possible ways to handle the stress. If your child seems anxious or stressed, talk about what's bothering him or her.Look for a pattern. If your child has night terrors, keep a sleep diary. For several nights, note how many minutes after bedtime a night terror episode occurs. If the timing is fairly consistent, wake your child about 15 minutes before you expect a night terror episode. Keep your child awake for five minutes, and then let him or her fall asleep again. Above all, be positive. However disruptive, night terrors aren't a serious condition  and they usually go away on their own. Symptoms References Parasomnias.

 Sleep Deprivation Gives Me the Chills by Scicurious January 4, 2010 Sci is about to embark on what she suspects will be two or three months with very little sleep, due to various personal and professional matters, and of course, blogging matters. And while she was discussing this with some friends, one of them brought up something very interesting: She said "does anyone else feel COLD when they don't get sleep?" And it occurred to me that she was very right. When I haven't been sleeping enough, I get COLD. I wake up freezing and end up bundling up in various thick, fuzzy sweatshirts and grasping on to mugs of hot coffee (though the coffee, of course, has a dual purpose). And so we started wondering, is this normal or anecdotal? Being an awesome scientist herself, my friend hit the Pubmed, and a few moments later, she handed me this: *pauses for a moment to put on fuzzy slippers* Vaara et al. The effect of 60-h sleep deprivation on cardiovascular regulation and body temperature. European Journal of Applied Physiology, 2009.For this study, the authors were interested to study the effects of sleep deprivation for problems like sustained military operations, and some sports events. Sci also thinks that the following study would have great application among college and graduate students, as she remembers (back when writing a very very important paper) staying up to the point where coffee literally made her sick (don't try this at home). Sleep deprivation is obviously not a very good thing, though most people in the US are hypothesized to live under a good degree of it most of the time (especially those of Sci's acquaintance who are new parents). It has negative effects on cognition, as well as important effects on things like inflammation and the endocrine system ,and Sci has also heard of negative effects on the immune system. What the authors of this study were concerned with, however, was with heart problems (cardiovascular regulation) and with body temperature. The cardiovascular regulation part is important, for those who are both young and old, constant changes due to sleep deprivation could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, something which most of us obviously do not need. So for this study, the authors recruited male and female active cadets (they have 17 males and 3 females, I wish they would do this study in an all female population as well, I don't think they got a big enough sampling) with strictly regimented normal activity and sleep times. They sleep deprived all of them for 60 hours (that's 2.5 days) of what I'm sure was a rollicking good time. Sci would not want to do this study unless she was getting some hefty compensation. During the time they were sleep deprived, physical activity was restricted to a minimum, but they were still in the military, and so performed tactical stuff, while also being allowed to do things like read, play cards, or watch TV. And they were constantly watched to make sure they wouldn't fall asleep (one hopes the experimenters were willing to go to great lengths to make sure the people didn't fall asleep. Doing silly dances, maybe singing karaoke with them til the wee hours...). During the sleep deprivation time, the scientists took measures of heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, as well as heart rate variability tests to look at differences in high frequency and low frequency power, which are supposed to reflect the influence of tone from the vagus, part of the sympathetic nervous system associated with drops in blood pressure and heart rate. And they got some very pretty graphs. See original article for figures Above you can see the measures of heart rate (the dashed line is sitting, the solid line is standing) during the three days of the study. You can see that heart rate in all the participants decreased significantly during sleep deprivation (Sci has anecdotally noticed the opposite effect, but suspects it's due to the vast amounts of caffeine she has imbibed during her sleep deprivation sessions). But the question is whether or not this is due to changes in vagal tone (increased sympathetic involvement which can lower heart rate) or some other factor. So they then show this: See original article for figures This is high frequency power taken during an active orthostatic test. In an orthostatic test (which you could actually try at home if you really wanted, though I don't recommend doing it on 60 hours of sleep deprivation), you lay down for 15 min (without falling asleep), and record the pulse. Then stand up, and 15 SECONDS later record the pulse again. It's usually used to determine if an athlete is overtraining, apparently a large difference between the two is supposed to be indicative, but Sci's no expert on this topic. It appears here they are using it as a measure of vagal stimulation And as you can see above that the high frequency power increased drastically over the three days of sleep deprivation, indicating an increase in vagal stimulation which could account for the DECREASE in heart rate seen above. Interestingly, though: See original article for figures You can see here that blood pressure over the study didn't change. As vagal stimulation causes decreases in heart rate AND blood pressure, Sci found this a little surprising, but it's very possible that there are other factors at work keeping the blood pressure up (stress, for example), and other studies have also shown no changes in blood pressure in response to sleep deprivation. But now we get to the figure that Sci was most interested in: See original article for figures Here we have measures of body temperature taken over three days, and you can see that body temperature does indeed DROP during sleep deprivation (though circadian rhythms were apparently maintained). The authors hypothesize that this could be due to a stress response, ,and possible reductions in activity of the hypothalamus, a regulatory center of the brain which has strong impacts on both body temperature and heart rate, and which could be responsible for some of the effects. So it's true, you do indeed get a little colder (though you can relax, it's only by half a degree C) as you get sleep deprived. A good reason to get some sleep! Not for Sci, though. Gotta get some work done. No wonder work gives me the chills! Source: Vaara, J., Kyröläinen, H., Koivu, M., Tulppo, M., & Finni, T. (2008).

 Sleepless nights drive brain to primitive state Oct 24, 2007 Researchers say lack of sleep creates fight or flight responses WASHINGTON - A few nights without sleep can not only make people tired and emotional, but may actually put the brain into a primitive "fight or flight" state, researchers said on Wednesday. Brain images of otherwise healthy men and women showed two full days without sleep seemed to rewire their brains, re-directing activity from the calming and rational prefrontal cortex to the "fear center"  the amygdala. "It's almost as though, without sleep, the brain had reverted back to more primitive patterns of activity, in that it was unable to put emotional experiences into context and produce controlled, appropriate responses," said Matthew Walker of the University of California Berkeley, who led the study. That a lack of sleep can make people grumpy is hardly news. "We all know implicitly the link between bad sleep the night before and bad mood the next day. We are just adding the brain basis to what we knew," Walker said in a telephone interview. Walker and colleagues at Harvard Medical School used functional magnetic resonance imaging, which can scan brain activity in real time, to see what was going on in the brains of their 26 young adult volunteers. Half were kept awake for a day, a night and another full day. The other half slept as normal. Writing in the journal Current Biology, Walker's team said they noticed profound changes in the brain activity of those volunteers who stayed up. "We found a strong overreaction from the emotional centers of the brain," Walker said. "It was almost as if the brain had been rewired, and connected to the fright, flight or fight area in the brain stem." And lab workers noticed a difference in the behavior of the sleep-deprived volunteers. "They seemed to swing like a pendulum between the broad spectrum of emotions," Walker said. "They would go from being remarkably upset at one time to where they found the same thing funny. They were almost giddy  punch drunk." Next Walker wants to test people who are chronically sleep-deprived, perhaps by letting them have just 5 hours of sleep over several days. The average adult needs 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night. He said the findings may shed light on psychiatric diseases. "This is the first set of experiments that demonstrate that even healthy people's brains mimic certain pathological psychiatric patterns when deprived of sleep. Before, it was difficult to separate out the effect of sleep versus the disease itself. Now we're closer to being able to look into whether the person has a psychiatric disease or a sleep disorder." A second study in the same journal suggests daylight-savings time regimes may cause similar effects. Till Roenneberg of Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich, Germany examined the sleep patterns of 55,000 people in Central Europe. He found people's internal circadian clocks adjusted well when the clock moved back in the autumn months, but failed to adjust when it moved forward, costing them an hour of sleep, in the spring. He said the effects held for weeks, perhaps causing people to feel continually sleep-deprived in the spring and summer. 
 How to get the sleep you need: An argument with the experts Psychology Today blog: Insomniac by Gayle Greene, PhD November 5, 2009 Tired of hearing the same old advice? Those of us who have trouble sleeping get tired of hearing the same old advice, the same half dozen rules. We read them everywhere. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and big meals late at night. Don't exercise or engage in stimulating activities near bedtime, such as reading or watching TV in bed. Try taking a hot bath or writing a "worry list." When you can't sleep, get out of bed and do something else. Get up at the same time every day, no matter how little sleep you've had-and don't nap. Oh, yes, and don't worry -you're probably getting all the sleep you need. As someone who's lived with insomnia for half a century, who spent six years interviewing sleep researchers and fellow insomniacs, writing Insomniac, I found that some of this advice may help some people some of the time, but there is no one-size- fits-all-solution. About caffeine, alcohol, and big meals close to sleep, the experts got that right. Caffeine sets the stress hormones flowing, speeds the heart, and raises blood pressure. The half life of caffeine, the time it takes for half of it to be broken down, is between 3 and 7 hours-so if your last cup was at 1 PM, you still have a quarter of it left in your system at 3 AM. If you drink it daily and are on the slow side of metabolizing it, it never leaves your system-and we do get slower as we age: if you could tolerate coffee when you were 35, that doesn't mean you can at 50. A woman between ovulation and menstruation takes about 25 percent longer to eliminate it. A woman on birth control pills takes twice as long, according to a 1993 study by M.J. Arnaud. But if life without caffeine is just too bleak, consider tea, which has about half the caffeine of coffee and has, besides, a substance that damps down the stress system. And if black tea is still too strong, green tea has about a third the caffeine content of that. Alcohol is confusing. It's a complex, "messy" drug that works on several systems, acting as a depressant but also stimulating the stress system. But even when it seems to help you sleep, it breaks down into by-products that come back to bite you, which is why you may wake up a few hours later with a bad buzz. And even if you don't wake up, the EEG shows shallower sleep. So you might want to rethink that nightcap. Avoid big meals close to bedtime-so say the experts, and so say I. Digestion is an active, intense, heat-generating process, not something you want to initiate close to sleep. The consumption of calories raises body temperature, and as a general rule, anything that raises your temperature-like an electric blanket, a warm room-may wreck sleep, since core body temperature needs to decline for sleep to be initiated and maintained. Exercise, of course, raises temperature in a big way, which is why we're told to avoid it in the evening. But I've found that if I leave a few hours between exercise and bedtime, evening exercise may actually help. When I swim within a few hours of bedtime, I get a lovely wave of sleepiness an hour or two later-maybe for the same reason that a hot bath helps, because it raises the body temperature so that the rapid decline that occurs afterward signals the body that it's time for sleep. My swimming tends to be relatively relaxed, however, and a strenuous aerobic workout that close to bedtime might have bad effects. You have to find what works for you. But in the hours just preceding sleep, you need to find ways of chilling out-I mean, literally, cooling down. This means no more trips to the kitchen, no late night emails or anxiety-provoking conversations or projects, physical or mental, nothing that speeds the heart and raises body temperature. Find some way of making a barrier between the day and sleep. Leave the day at the bedroom door. The experts tell us we should practice nightly sleep rituals, but the unwinding activities people find are actually more various than expert advice allows. Many people find reading bed or watching TV a necessary part of relaxing. Insomniacs tell me that reading computer manuals, or Emmnual Kant, works beautifully. Not for me-my mind has to be at least somewhat engaged. The New York Times works well, sometimes a novel, though no page-turners or cliff-hangers. And nothing work-related. My preferred way of unwinding is a DVD. Nothing action-packed or adrenalin-pumping, though. Chick flicks work best, things like The Holiday, The Devil Wears Prada, The Jane Austen Book Club- pretty to look at and they have happy endings. A friend swears she can't sleep without watching a half hour of Sex and the City every night. Travel documentaries work well, too, sending me to sleep with visions of other places, other lives, dancing through my head. Many people have success with worry lists or journal writing as a way of decompressing. Not me: I don't want anything to do with words, and nothing to do with the computer. I work with words all day long, I have words enough buzzing through my head. Besides, when I write, I conjure, bring to life-the last thing I want to do with a worry. No, give me a chick flick.

 I am embarassed to admit how much I sleep Some days are worse than others. I can sleep up to 14 hours day. On worse days I may have broken sleep, but almost like two big naps instead of a steady sleep. From what I read, it seems folks like us tend to have sleep problems in some way. Is there ever a problem, like that should be adressed from sleeping too much? Or should I listen to my body when it requires this much sleep. If I set my clock to wake up and it is with less sleep, it often takes me a good few hours to get that groggy, dopey feeling to go away. Then I can almost feel myself crashing like feeling like if I don't lay down I will just fall asleep sitting where I am. Any insights are appreciated 
 When night turns to day By Gord Howard Anchor Magazine Getting a good night’s sleep is paramount for good mental health, yet depression can actually wreak havoc on sleep habits Karri Christansen knows all too well what 3 a.m. looks like. The Chicago, Illinois-area freelance journalist was diagnosed with depression 20 years ago and says she spent about one-quarter of those years lying awake at night because of it. “It made me feel like I was losing my mind,” says Christansen. “I couldn’t focus. I was exhausted all the time. I would take naps during the day to make up for the sleep I wasn’t getting during the night, and that would perpetuate the insomnia.” Christansen says she got about five hours of sleep each night―usually divided into two or three sessions―over the course of about five years. “It was classic depression insomnia. I was up between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m., wide awake. Thoughts were racing through my brain―nothing I could grasp or hold on to, just tidbits of things: work, family situations, song lyrics. [It was] just a cacophony of sounds going through my head.” And the up-and-down nature of her freelance career―and income―whereby busy weeks are followed by slow ones, just gave her one more thing to think about during the night. Join the club Most people, at one time or another, will experience at least a brief period of insomnia, says Michael Thase, MD, of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. For those who experience longer bouts, the effects are far-reaching, impacting a person’s mood, appetite, and even their vulnerability to illness. “Sleep is one-third of our lives, [so] the cliché goes,” says Thase, a distinguished fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and active clinical investigator whose work centers on evaluation and treatment of mood disorders. “[And] for most people, sleep is a marker of well-being.” Sleep rests our bodies and minds; it has been proven to promote growth hormone levels in children, while those who don’t get good sleep have low growth hormone secretion. Sleep also produces an increased level of protein molecules that restore the body and help it recover from things like stress, air pollution, and infection. A good night’s sleep allows the body to repair damaged tissue, including that caused by exposure to ultraviolet light. Several studies also show that people who sleep better live longer. One, led by Sanjay R. Patel of the Harvard Medical School, involved 82,000 nurses and found a higher risk of early death for those who slept six or fewer hours per night. For people with depression, however, a sound, recuperative sleep can be elusive. In fact, approximately 80 percent of depressed people deal with some form of sleep disorder, compared to roughly 15 percent of the general population, says Thase. In most cases the problem is insomnia, of which there are three kinds: onset insomnia (the inability to fall asleep); middle insomnia (waking frequently throughout the night); and terminal insomnia (waking early and being unable to fall back to sleep). Prolonged insomnia can have serious psychological and physical implications, including an inability to concentrate during the day, mood changes, vulnerability to illness, and a loss of energy. At the American Diabetes Association’s 2001 annual meeting, it was reported that people who fail to get enough sleep actually become less sensitive to insulin, thereby putting them at an increased risk for high blood pressure and diabetes. Further, a 2004 study at the University of Bristol, England, found that people who sleep for five hours a night produce 15 percent more ghrelin and 15 percent less leptin than people who sleep eight hours. These changes in hormonal balance lead to an increase in hunger, which can cause weight gain. Failing to get enough sleep can also compromise a person’s ability to do everyday things, such as operate a vehicle. “One complete night of sleep deprivation is as impairing in simulated driving tests as a legally intoxicating blood-alcohol level,” said Mark Mahowald, a professor of neurology at the University of Minnesota Medical School, in a 2004 article on BioEdOnline.org. Losing sleep over a lack of sleep For Christansen, a remedy for her insomnia wasn’t easy to find. Because she had already been prescribed an antidepressant, she didn’t want to try an over-the-counter sleep aid to control the insomnia, but she was losing her ability to concentrate and the energy to enjoy the things she had always liked doing. “I felt like the walking dead. I was just so out of it,” she recalls. “When you have insomnia, you go to sleep wondering, ‘Am I going to wake up at 2 o’clock in the morning?’ It’s almost a self-fulfilling prophecy, because you go to sleep anxious about not being able to sleep, [and] then you wake up and you think, ‘Oh crap, I’m up again!’” After trying several medications, Christansen’s doctor finally found one that both controls her depression and helps her sleep at night. She’s not completely cured, however. The insomnia still comes back sometimes, usually during stressful times. “Don’t be afraid to ask for help,” she advises. “Don’t be afraid to say to your doctor, ‘Look, I can’t sleep. I need something to help me sleep.’” Exercise helps, too. She doesn’t belong to a gym, but because Christansen works from home, she is able to squeeze moments of activity into her day: push-ups while she’s doing the laundry, or using her step machine while she runs the dishwasher. The five stages of sleep To understand insomnia, it’s important to first understand sleep. A healthy person should take no longer than 30 minutes to fall asleep at night, explains Thase. Through the first four of the five stages of sleep, brain activity slows progressively; the heart rate slows, breathing becomes shallower, blood pressure drops, and muscles relax. But in the fifth stage―the REM (rapid eye movement) stage―the brain comes to life. Memories, ideas, recent experiences all go through the mental mixer. It is during REM sleep that a person dreams. “In REM sleep, brain activity looks just as it does when we’re awake, but our muscles are inhibited,” Donna Giles, PhD, a professor of psychology and neurology at New York’s University of Rochester Medical Center, said in a 2001 interview published on sciencedaily.com. So why do people with depression have so much trouble sleeping? One theory is that depressed individuals move too quickly into REM sleep, missing out on the restorative quiet stages that lead up to it, causing them to spend a disproportionate amount of sleep time dealing with information. It’s also possible, Thase says, that people with a more severe depression sleep lightly because their minds are in a too-high state of psychophysiological arousal to sleep deeply, but “these are speculation, not facts.” He notes insomnia may not only be a symptom of depression, but a potential indicator of its onset as well. “If you don’t have depression but you have insomnia, the chances are greater that over the next six months to a year, you will develop depression.” In fact, the National Sleep Foundation reports there is evidence to suggest that people with insomnia have a ten-fold risk of developing depression compared to people who sleep well. However, Thase rejects the suggestion that because the two conditions appear related, there might be a single genetic cause found someday that will allow both to be treated as one. “There are likely to be some number of inherited factors that increase the likelihood of depression or insomnia, and there may well be inherited resilience factors that decrease that likelihood,” he says. “There are some people that, even under the most stressful circumstances, don’t become depressed, [while] others don’t require much life stress to become depressed.” Find what works Generally speaking, sleeping pills prolong sleep, but they aren’t effective at increasing the amount of deep sleep a person needs, Thase says. And often, the antidepressant that a person with depression is prescribed reduces REM sleep. Finding the right antidepressant can be key, as can learning relaxation techniques and lifestyle changes to better prepare the body for sleep. “Sleeping pills alone don’t treat depression; just helping people sleep better doesn’t relieve the depression,” says Thase. “(But) it does help them to be more comfortable, (so) they have one less thing bothering them.” Gord Howard is a freelance journalist who has worked in the Canadian newspaper industry for more than 20 years. 
 A Dream Interpretation: Tuneups for the Brain By BENEDICT CAREY, New York Times November 10, 2009 Its snowing heavily, and everyone in the backyard is in a swimsuit, at some kind of party: Mom, Dad, the high school principal, theres even an ex-girlfriend. And is that Elvis, over by the piñata? Uh-oh. Dreams are so rich and have such an authentic feeling that scientists have long assumed they must have a crucial psychological purpose. To Freud, dreaming provided a playground for the unconscious mind; to Jung, it was a stage where the psyches archetypes acted out primal themes. Newer theories hold that dreams help the brain to consolidate emotional memories or to work though current problems, like divorce and work frustrations. Yet what if the primary purpose of dreaming isnt psychological at all? In a paper published last month in the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Dr. J. Allan Hobson, a psychiatrist and longtime sleep researcher at Harvard, argues that the main function of rapid-eye-movement sleep, or REM, when most dreaming occurs, is physiological. The brain is warming its circuits, anticipating the sights and sounds and emotions of waking. It helps explain a lot of things, like why people forget so many dreams, Dr. Hobson said in an interview. Its like jogging; the body doesnt remember every step, but it knows it has exercised. It has been tuned up. Its the same idea here: dreams are tuning the mind for conscious awareness. Drawing on work of his own and others, Dr. Hobson argues that dreaming is a parallel state of consciousness that is continually running but normally suppressed during waking. The idea is a prominent example of how neuroscience is altering assumptions about everyday (or every-night) brain functions. Most people who have studied dreams start out with some predetermined psychological ideas and try to make dreaming fit those, said Dr. Mark Mahowald, a neurologist who is director of the sleep disorders program at Hennepin County Medical Center, in Minneapolis. What I like about this new paper is that he doesnt make any assumptions about what dreaming is doing. The paper has already stirred controversy and discussion among Freudians, therapists and other researchers, including neuroscientists. Dr. Rodolfo Llinás, a neurologist and physiologist at New York University, called Dr. Hobsons reasoning impressive but said it was not the only physiological interpretation of dreams. I argue that dreaming is not a parallel state but that it is consciousness itself, in the absence of input from the senses, said Dr. Llinás, who makes the case in the book I of the Vortex: From Neurons to Self (M.I.T., 2001). Once people are awake, he argued, their brain essentially revises its dream images to match what it sees, hears and feels  the dreams are corrected by the senses. These novel ideas about dreaming are based partly on basic findings about REM sleep. In evolutionary terms, REM appears to be a recent development; it is detectable in humans and other warm-blooded mammals and birds. And studies suggest that REM makes its appearance very early in life  in the third trimester for humans, well before a developing child has experience or imagery to fill out a dream. In studies, scientists have found evidence that REM activity helps the brain build neural connections, particularly in its visual areas. The developing fetus may be seeing something, in terms of brain activity, long before the eyes ever open  the developing brain drawing on innate, biological models of space and time, like an internal virtual-reality machine. Full-on dreams, in the usual sense of the word, come much later. Their content, in this view, is a kind of crude test run for what the coming day may hold. None of this is to say that dreams are devoid of meaning. Anyone who can remember a vivid dream knows that at times the strange nighttime scenes reflect real hopes and anxieties: the young teacher who finds himself naked at the lectern; the new mother in front of an empty crib, frantic in her imagined loss. But people can read almost anything into the dreams that they remember, and they do exactly that. In a recent study of more than 1,000 people, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Harvard found strong biases in the interpretations of dreams. For instance, the participants tended to attach more significance to a negative dream if it was about someone they disliked, and more to a positive dream if it was about a friend. In fact, research suggests that only about 20 percent of dreams contain people or places that the dreamer has encountered. Most images appear to be unique to a single dream. Scientists know this because some people have the ability to watch their own dreams as observers, without waking up. This state of consciousness, called lucid dreaming, is itself something a mystery  and a staple of New Age and ancient mystics. But it is a real phenomenon, one in which Dr. Hobson finds strong support for his argument for dreams as a physiological warm-up before waking. In dozens of studies, researchers have brought people into the laboratory and trained them to dream lucidly. They do this with a variety of techniques, including auto-suggestion as head meets pillow (I will be aware when I dream; I will observe) and teaching telltale signs of dreaming (the light switches dont work; levitation is possible; it is often impossible to scream). Lucid dreaming occurs during a mixed state of consciousness, sleep researchers say  a heavy dose of REM with a sprinkling of waking awareness. This is just one kind of mixed state, but there are whole variety of them, Dr. Mahowald said. Sleepwalking and night terrors, he said, represent mixtures of muscle activation and non-REM sleep. Attacks of narcolepsy reflect an infringement of REM on normal daytime alertness. In study published in September in the journal Sleep, Ursula Voss of J. W. Goethe-University in Frankfurt led a team that analyzed brain waves during REM sleep, waking and lucid dreaming. It found that lucid dreaming had elements of REM and of waking  most notably in the frontal areas of the brain, which are quiet during normal dreaming. Dr. Hobson was a co-author on the paper. You are seeing this split brain in action, he said. This tells me that there are these two systems, and that in fact they can be running at the same time. Researchers have a way to go before they can confirm or fill out this working hypothesis. But the payoffs could extend beyond a deeper understanding of the sleeping brain. People who struggle with schizophrenia suffer delusions of unknown origin. Dr. Hobson suggests that these flights of imagination may be related to an abnormal activation of a dreaming consciousness. Let the dreamer awake, and you will see psychosis, Jung said. For everyone else, the idea of dreams as a kind of sound check for the brain may bring some comfort, as well. That ominous dream of people gathered on the lawn for some strange party? Probably meaningless. No reason to scream, even if it were possible.

 I have some questions about waking up paralyzed. Has anyone ever experienced this, or is it just me? A year ago I went off my medication, clozapine, because it was making me wake up most nights paralyzed. I would wake up and look at the clock. It would usually be around 2am. I could hear anything that was going on. I could hear the tv in the next room if it was left on, or the tap in the bathroom dripping, or whatever was making noise at that time. I could see the dog twitching from a bad drem at the end of the bed. I would go to move, but I couldn't. I was completely paralyzed. I would go to scream, but I couldn't get anything out. This was the scariest feeling in the entire world. I told my doctor, but she said it was nothing. I stayed on the clozapine for another couple of months, because it was the only drug that was doing anything for me. After waking up paralyzed most nights, I couldn't stand it anymore. I would try to stay awake all night, so I wouldn't need to go through it. I couldn't stay awake 24/7, so I told my doctor I was going off the drug. She highly advised me not to, but she obviously didn't know the fear and panic of waking up in the middle of the night not being able to move. Since I have stopped taking clozapine, I have not had this happen again. I have severe insomnia now, but I take zopiclone at night to fix that. Has anyone else ever had this happen? My doctor looked at me strange when I brought it up to her a while back. What causes it? Is there an actual name for it? Thanks for reading. 
 Maybe I am a weirdo, but lucid dreaming is an occasional hobby of mine. :mrgreen: Anyone else here have dreams where you know you are dreaming and do cool stuff...like fly? Sometimes I have so much fun in my dreams that I wake up from them. I've actually fallen asleep "awake", passing through sleep paralysis (only scary if you are to fight it) and into imagery dropping right into a lucid dream. Sleep paralysis is weird, you feel this weird static sensation and weird colors, buzzing sound, can't move, then you feel like you are falling and drop into a dream. Strange but interesting. One of the more interesting lucid dreams I had was: I was standing on an incline at the bottom of a mountain. It was lush and green and the sky was amazing with a rainbow diving behind the mountain. I started to take a picture of it then heard gunshots. Some militant guys with guns were shouting at us (me and my b/f) and told us to sit down. Well, they had guns so we sat. They came over and told us to go with them that we were under arrest. They had Russian accents and spoke in a weird language when they talked to each other. They led us into a generic building resembling several things, a school, a mall, an office, a hospital a police station...etc. They left us and we looked at each other and said lets get outta here! We ran out of the building and I felt the most oppressive feeling as we ran out to the 10 lane highway in front of the lonely mountain. It was gray and hazy and we started running across the lanes. Cars would just appear out of the haze and come strait at us from the right. We reached the median and a car coming from the right got onto the median and tried to run us over. We barely made it across the other 5 lanes. We went down a little hill and there was a gravel lane than went through a series of tolls and such. We ran down the lane and reached the first toll and my b/f said it senses the cars by weight so it won't pick us up. We ducked under the barrier and heard an alarm. Some Arabian guys started shouting at us in some weird language. A huge black German Shepherd was lunging at the fence on the other side of the toll booth. They let him out and we started running but not fast enough so we ran like dogs on all fours and got out of sight. Then there was a tent instead of toll booth. We reached it and an Arabian boy stepped out from behind a rusty door and a pastry appeared in my hand. He said squeeze it one time for pink, I looked at him and my b/f and said "why is there so much math?" I squished it once and pink jelly came out. "The numbers are so real!" I ate it and it was really good and handed him a penny and he smiled. Then we walked around the tent and it was made of the most beautiful psychedelic fabric that you could see through. We decided to hide inside from the guys with guns who were still looking for us. We could still hear them shouting. There was a wooden bench in there that I was going to sit on but it was covered in ****************. I walked away form it and there were silk pillows piled up all pristine and clean. I laid down there and my friend Rene was there. She haded me a beautiful handmade wooden thing. It was flat kind of banana/sword shaped stained dark brown and had the name of a Island on it. She had several of these and they were varying in shape, size and color. They were all on a key chain and she told me that they were all the places she had traveled too. Then my mom handed me a small white plastic Roman architect building. I turned it around and my brother and his g/f were on the steps. She said they had been there and then handed me another one similar with them on it but it floated as if weightless. She told me they went in space to that one. 
 Recently I've noticed something strange happening to my dreams. I seem to remember my dreams not when I first wake up but throughout the day, usually I'll think or remember something that is somewhat related to what i dreamt about and I'll get flashes of images from my dream play through my head. Also I can recall dreams weeks after I've had them when I've only thought about it once when i initially remembered them, usually when I'm trying to go to sleep. Along with this it usually takes me 3-4 hours to go to sleep. The dreams I have are stranger then what I've previously experienced, such as being on the death star with the monsters from the movie "Aliens" attacking and getting into a fight to the death vs. Darth Maul. I seem to die a lot but it's instant and i restart the situation over untill i'm successful, it reminds me of a video game. It may be the antidepressants I'm on but I'm not sure. 
 Hi all I come here to get some insight on how to understand my wife's fear. in June 2008 my wife came back from asia which is 23 hours flight and the time difference was 12 hour ahead. When she come back to Canada, as usual we will have some jet lag. But this time she developed a big fear that left a scar until today. The bad experience of unable to sleep in June 2008 caries on until today. She said right before going to bed. her mind just racing and trying to figure out the best way to rest her mind. And because of an event in June 2008, she has this fear that it will happens again. She said that it's like she forgets how to sleep... so she tried different things, like remembering when she was still a child how she put to bed, and what she is thinking while closing her eyes, etc., etc. I must say I don't know 100% how she feels or what she feels, I just tried to understand as much as I can I thought by posting here I can get some insight? thanks 
 Early Risers Are Mutants By Cassandra Willyard, ScienceNOW Daily News 13 August 2009 Don't hate those people who are perky and efficient after only a few hours of sleep. They can't help it. New research suggests that a genetic mutation may explain why some people sleep less. Researchers don't know exactly why some people do fine with as little as 4 hours of sleep a night, while others need 12. "We've believed for a long time that there's a genetic basis," says Paul Shaw, a neurobiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. But scientists have only recently begun to ferret out which genes are responsible. In 2001, geneticist Ying-Hui Fu and colleagues identified a mutation in a gene called Per2 that appeared to cause familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome (FASPS). People who have this condition sleep a normal 8 hours, but they go to bed earlier than most people, retiring at 6 or 7 in the evening and waking at 3 or 4 in the morning. "After that was published, a lot of these people [with unusual sleep schedules] came to us," says Fu, who is now at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. "So we started to collect DNA samples." The team now has genetic information from more than 60 families. Fu and her colleagues have spent the past several years mining this vast genetic storehouse for more mutations that might affect sleep patterns. In 2005, they uncovered another mutation associated with FASPS. And now they say they have found the first genetic mutation in humans that appears to affect sleep duration rather than sleep timing. The mutation lies in DEC2, a gene that codes for a protein that helps turn off expression of other genes, including some that control circadian rhythm, the internal clock that regulates a person's sleep-wake cycle. The mutation occurred in just two people, a mother and her daughter. The women sleep an average of only 6.25 hours, whereas the rest of the family members sleep a more typical 8 hours. To confirm that this mutation shortens sleep, Fu and colleagues engineered mice to carry the mutant form of DEC2. The mutant mice slept about an hour less than normal mice, the team reports today in Science. The finding also held for fruit flies: Mutant flies slept about 2 hours less than normal flies. DEC2 likely isn't the whole story when it comes to short sleep. "Genetic control of sleep is going to be complex and is going to include multiple types of genes," says Shaw, who was not affiliated with the study. But that doesn't diminish the importance of this paper, he notes. "It's really an amazing piece of work." The findings, says Fu, could lead to better treatments for sleep disorders. If the mutated form of DEC2 were available in a pill, Fu says she'd take it, noting that she needs about 8 hours of shuteye a night to feel rested. "All my life I've wanted to be able to sleep less." 
 Nightmares By Mayo Clinic staff Aug. 15, 2009 Nightmares are disturbing dreams associated with anxiety, fear or terror. Nightmares are common. They begin in childhood and tend to decrease after about age 10. However, some people have them as teens or adults, or throughout their lives. Until age 13, boys and girls have nightmares in equal numbers. At age 13, nightmares become more prevalent in girls than boys. Nightmares seem real, often becoming more disturbing as the dream unfolds. But nightmares usually are nothing to worry about. They may become a problem if you have them frequently and they cause you to fear going to sleep or keep you from sleeping well. Symptoms Nightmares are parasomnias  undesirable experiences that occur during sleep. You've had a nightmare if: Your dream wakes you upYou feel scared, anxious, angry, sad or disgusted as a result of your dreamYou can think clearly upon awakening, and can recall details of your dreamYour dream occurs near the end of your sleep timeYour dream keeps you from falling back to sleep easily When to see a doctor Occasional nightmares aren't usually a cause for concern. If your child has nightmares, you can simply mention them at a routine well-child exam. Talk to your doctor earlier if your or your child's nightmares: Become more frequentRoutinely disrupt sleepCause you or your child to fear going to sleep Causes Most nightmares occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. You normally go through four to six sleep cycles a night, cycling through the sleep stages in about 90 minutes. Your REM stage lengthens with each cycle, from several seconds in the first cycle to up to an hour in the last. You're more likely to have a nightmare in the last third of your night. Another disorder can be associated with nightmares. Many other factors can trigger nightmares, including: Stress. Sometimes the ordinary stresses of daily life, such as a problem at home or school, trigger nightmares. A major change, such as a move or the death of a loved one, can have the same effect.A traumatic event. Nightmares are common after an accident, injury or other traumatic event. Nightmares are prominent in post-traumatic stress disorder.Scary books and movies. Reading scary books or watching scary movies, especially before bed, can cause nightmares.Bedtime snacks. For some, eating right before bed  and the resulting boost in metabolism and brain activity  leads to nightmares.Illness. Sometimes being sick triggers nightmares, especially if the illness is accompanied by a fever.Medications. Some drugs  including certain antidepressants, narcotics and barbiturates  can trigger nightmares. Complications Occasional nightmares usually aren't a concern, but regularly disrupted sleep can be. It can cause excessive daytime sleepiness, which can lead to difficulties at school or work, or problems with everyday tasks such as driving. Preparing for your appointment For children, nightmares tend to decrease by the time they're adolescents. However, if you have concerns about safety or underlying conditions, you may want to see your doctor. Your doctor may refer you to a sleep specialist. Your doctor also will need to know: When the nightmares beganHow often the nightmares occur and what they're aboutYour medical historyAny medications you're taking or have takenWhether you have or have had any other sleep problemsWhether you have family members with sleep problems It's a good idea to keep a sleep diary for two weeks before your appointment to help your doctor understand your sleeping pattern. In the morning, you record as much as you know of your or your child's bedtime ritual, quality of sleep, and so on. At the end of the day, you record behaviors that may affect your or your child's sleep, such as caffeine consumption (chocolate and cola count) and any medications taken. Tests and diagnosis There are no tests routinely performed for nightmares, but if your or your child's sleep is severely disturbed, your doctor may recommend an overnight sleep study to help determine if the nightmares are connected to another sleep disorder. During the study, technicians monitor your brain waves, heart rate, breathing and movement while you sleep. Treatments and drugs Treatment for nightmares isn't usually necessary. If the nightmares are associated with an underlying medical or mental health condition, treatment is aimed at the underlying problem. If stress or anxiety seems to be contributing to the nightmares, your doctor may suggest stress-reduction techniques, counseling or therapy. Medication is rarely used to treat nightmares. However, medications that reduce REM sleep or reduce awakenings during sleep may be recommended if you have severe sleep disturbance. Lifestyle and home remedies If you're having nightmares, try some relaxation techniques before bedtime. Take a warm bath, meditate or practice deep breathing. If your child is struggling with nightmares, be patient, calm and reassuring. Sometimes a little creativity helps, too. Talk about the dream. Ask your child to describe the nightmare. What happened? Who was in the dream? What made it scary? Then remind your child that nightmares aren't real and can't hurt you.Put stress in its place. If your child seems anxious or stressed, talk about what's bothering him or her. Practice some simple stress-relief activities, such as deep breathing.Rewrite the ending. Help your child imagine a happy ending for the nightmare. Encourage your child to draw a picture of the nightmare, "talk" to the characters in the nightmare or write about the nightmare in a journal.Provide company. Your child might feel more secure if he or she sleeps with a favorite stuffed animal, blanket or other comfort object.Enlist a guard. If your child is very young, you might assign a doll or stuffed animal the job of "staying awake" all night to guard against nightmares.Brighten up. Use a night light in your child's room. If your child wakes up during the night, the light might be reassuring.Open the doors. Leave your child's door open at night so that he or she won't feel alone. Leave your door open, too, in case your child needs comfort during the night. Safety counts, too. If your child has frequent nightmares, make sure his or her bedroom is safe. Skip the bunk beds, and consider blocking doorways or stairways with a gate in case your child tries to run after he or she wakes up. Symptoms References Nightmares and other disturbing parasomnias.

 Sleepwalking By Mayo Clinic staff Aug. 15, 2009 Sleepwalking  also known as somnambulism  usually involves getting up and walking around while asleep. Most common in children between the ages of 8 and 12, sleepwalking often is a random event that doesn't signal any serious problems or require treatment. However, sleepwalking can occur at any age and may involve unusual, even dangerous behaviors, such as climbing out a window or urinating in closets or trash cans. If anyone in your household sleepwalks, it's important to protect him or her from sleepwalking injuries. Symptoms Sleepwalking is classified as a parasomnia  an undesirable behavior or experience during sleep. Someone who is sleepwalking may: Sit up in bed and open his or her eyesHave a glazed, glassy-eyed expressionRoam around the house, perhaps opening and closing doors or turning lights on and offDo routine activities, such as getting dressed or making a snack  even driving a carSpeak or move in a clumsy mannerScream, especially if also experiencing night terrorsBe difficult to arouse during an episode Sleepwalking usually occurs during deep sleep, early in the night  often one to two hours after falling asleep. Sleepwalking is unlikely to occur during naps. The sleepwalker won't remember the episode in the morning. Sleepwalking episodes can occur rarely or often, including multiple times a night for a few consecutive nights. Sleepwalking is common in children, who typically outgrow the behavior by their teens, as the amount of deep sleep they get decreases. When to see a doctor Occasional episodes of sleepwalking aren't usually a cause for concern. You can simply mention the sleepwalking at a routine physical or well-child exam. However, consult your doctor if the sleepwalking episodes: Become more frequentLead to dangerous behavior or injuryAre accompanied by other signs or symptomsContinue into your child's teens Causes Many factors can contribute to sleepwalking, including: Sleep deprivationFatigueStressAnxietyFeverSleeping in unfamiliar surroundingsSome medications, such as zolpidem (Ambien) Sleepwalking is sometimes associated with underlying conditions that affect sleep, such as: Seizure disordersSleep-disordered breathing  a group of disorders characterized by abnormal breathing patterns during sleep, the most common of which is obstructive sleep apneaRestless leg syndrome (RLS)Migraine headachesStrokeHead injuries or brain swellingPremenstrual period In other cases, use of alcohol, illicit drugs or certain medications  including some antibiotics, antihistamines, sedatives and sleeping pills  can trigger sleepwalking episodes. Risk factors Sleepwalking appears to run in families. It's more common if you have one parent who has a history of sleepwalking, and much more common if both parents have a history of the disorder. Complications Sleepwalking itself isn't necessarily a concern, but sleepwalkers can easily hurt themselves  especially if they wander outdoors or drive a car during a sleepwalking episode. Prolonged sleep disruption can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness and possible school or behavior issues. Also, sleepwalkers usually disturb others' sleep. Treatments and drugs Treatment for sleepwalking isn't usually necessary. If you notice your child or anyone else in your household sleepwalking, gently lead him or her back to bed. It's not dangerous to the sleepwalker to wake him or her, but it can be disruptive. The person may be confused and disoriented if awakened. Men, in particular, might attack the awakener. Treatment for adults who sleepwalk may include hypnosis. Rarely, sleepwalking may result from a drug, so a change of medication may be required. If the sleepwalking leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or poses a risk of serious injury, your doctor may recommend medication. Sometimes short-term use of benzodiazepines or certain antidepressants can stop sleepwalking episodes. If the sleepwalking is associated with an underlying medical or mental health condition, treatment is aimed at the underlying problem. For example, if the sleepwalking is due to another sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea, using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a machine that delivers air pressure through a mask placed over your nose while you sleep, keeps your upper airway passages open. Lifestyle and home remedies If sleepwalking is a problem for you or your child, here are some things to try: Make the environment safe for sleepwalking. To help prevent injury, close and lock all windows and exterior doors at night. You might even lock interior doors or place alarms or bells on the doors. Block doorways or stairways with a gate, and move electrical cords or other objects that pose a tripping hazard. If your child sleepwalks, don't let him or her sleep in a bunk bed. Place any sharp or fragile objects out of reach.Get more sleep. Fatigue can contribute to sleepwalking. Try an earlier bedtime or a more regular sleep schedule.Establish a regular, relaxing routine before bedtime. Do quiet, calming activities  such as reading books, doing puzzles or soaking in a warm bath  before bed. Meditation or relaxation exercises may help, too.Put stress in its place. Identify the things that stress you out, and brainstorm possible ways to handle the stress. If your child seems anxious or stressed, talk about what's bothering him or her.Look for a pattern. If your child is sleepwalking, keep a sleep diary. For several nights, note how many minutes after bedtime a sleepwalking episode occurs. If the timing is fairly consistent, wake your child about 15 minutes before you expect a sleepwalking episode. Keep your child awake for five minutes, and then let him or her fall asleep again. Above all, be positive. However disruptive, sleepwalking usually isn't a serious condition  and it usually goes away on its own. Symptoms References Sleepwalking.

 Unravelling the mystery of emotions and vivid long-lasting memories by Jessica Guenzel Wednesday, 12 August 2009 A new study by researchers at Wake Forest University School of Medicine may reveal how long-lasting memories form in the brain. The researchers hope that the findings, scheduled to appear in an upcoming issue of the journal Neuroscience, may one day help scientists develop treatments to prevent and treat conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder. "Although many things are known about memories that form from repeat experiences, not much is known with regard to how some memories form with just one exposure," said Ashok Hegde, PhD, an associate professor of neurobiology and anatomy and the lead investigator on the study. Scientists do know that people tend to remember extremely happy or sad occasions vividly because of the emotional connection, Hegde said. Extreme emotions trigger the release of a chemical in the brain called norepinephrine (noradrenaline), which is related to adrenaline (epinephrine). That norepinephrine somehow helps memories last a long time - some even a lifetime. For example, he said, when a person asks, "Where were you when the 9/11 attacks happened?" most people can recall immediately where they were and what they were doing when they heard the news. They remember the moment as if it just happened because a national tragedy arouses emotion and emotion somehow makes memories last for a long time, Hegde explained. For the current study, Hegde and colleagues looked at how norepinephrine helps female mice remember the scent of their male partners after being exposed to it just once during mating. The researchers studied the neural circuitry in the accessory olfactory bulb, the part of the brain where memory of the male partner's scent is stored. They found that norepinephrine, released in mice while mating, activates an enzyme called Protein Kinase C (PKC), specifically, the "alpha" isoform of PKC, in the accessory olfactory bulb. The PKC enzyme has about a dozen forms, or isoforms, that exist in the brains of mammals, including humans. "The fact that PKC-alpha is activated through the release of norepinephrine is an important discovery," Hegde said. "It explains how strong memories form for specific sensory experiences." In female mice, the information about the partner's scent is carried by a chemical called glutamate and the fact that mating has occurred is conveyed by the release of norepinephrine, Hegde explained. Previous studies have found that glutamate and norepinephrine together, but not individually, cause strong memory formation for the male's scent. "No one knew how this happened," Hegde said. "Our findings indicate that the PKC-alpha enzyme tells the nerve cells in the brain that these two chemicals have arrived together. PKC-alpha is like the bouncer who lifts the rope blocking the entrance to an exclusive club for strong memories when glutamate and norepinephrine arrive together. If they arrive alone, they can't get past the velvet rope." Hegde explained that, when memory is stored in the brain, the connections between nerve cells, called synapses, change. Strong memories are formed when synapses become stronger through structural changes that occur at the synapse. PKC-alpha works with glutamate and norepinephrine to create those changes. Hegde said that the next step in this line of research is to learn exactly how PKC-alpha can turn genes on in nerve cells. Understanding the precise sequence of molecules that are activated by PKC-alpha will help researchers block the function of these molecules and test whether they block memory formation. This future research will not only explain strong pleasant memories, but also how strong unpleasant memories form in instances like post-traumatic stress disorder.

 Lately I haven't been able to sleep more than 6 hours and sometimes not more than 2. I don't feel tired or run down, quite the opposite but know that technically its unhealthy to not get sleep. I told my therapist about it and she said to make a bedtime routine. I told her I've tried that but its just that I am not tired...then she says something like "you are tired at some point but don't realize it" and to keep trying even if it doesn't work at first. She also said that not getting enough sleep makes that worse. I see what she's saying but then it makes it a bit of a paradox...the hyperness causes me to not sleep, yet the not sleeping makes you more hyper? One of my friends has insomnia but he can't sleep but is tired and gets more and more tired as a result. The only thing that happens to me is that I get to the point I can't think strait, completely unfocused, can't concentrate, everything annoys me, all because I haven't slept enough. So I drink herbal relaxing tea and write in my journal then go to bed. I lay there and just feel too energized to fall asleep. I my mind there's things I could be doing rather than uselessly laying there not sleeping. I'm too into what I have been doing lately to quit thinking about it. I am working on a book that I wrote and illustrated. Its a philosophical poetry book and I am nearly finished and going to start on some more. I just have so many ideas and get all hyped up about it all the time...even if I could sleep I'd be wasting time because I can function without. LOL ok I know that's a counterproductive thought but then irrelevant because I can't fall asleep anyway. Its like laying down makes me more hyper because then I am not using any energy then and it builds up. I try to use it up by exercising a lot during the day walking and running w/ my dog. But I only feel temporarily relaxed via the endorphins. It doesn't last and it doesn't make me tired. 
 Just wondered if after a bad run of depression, if anyone finds they can sleep for days on end. Although I am feeling much better lately, I am exhausted. I still have downers through out the day and anxiety etc, which is "normal" for me. I am just finding after I have this depression and it starts to lift a bit, I get more sleepy, or at least I feel more sleepy. I also wasn't sleeping too good the past month either. Maybe due to the depression. It happens also after having bad anxiety or a panic attack too. My doctor explained that the nerve endings all go on overload, so it is a full body experience anxiety and panic. So that made sense. Just never knew a reason for a tiredness post bad depression. Thanks! 
 Forty Winks Used To Be Two Twenties: How Aging Changes Sleep Patterns by Allison Aubrey, NPR.org August 3, 2009 Not sleeping well? It's a common complaint. Sixty-four million Americans report at least occasional bouts of insomnia. And the anxiety of waking up in the middle of the night can be maddening. Psychiatrist Thomas Wehr has one consoling message for those who wake up at 2 a.m.: This is likely the way our ancestors slept. "There are historical records of people sleeping in two bouts at night," Wehr explains. They called the first bout dead sleep, and the second bout was called morning sleep. The wakeful period in between was referred to as watch or watching. Before the days of artificial lighting, a winter day could bring 14 hours of solid darkness. People lived from sun to sun. Wehr was curious as to what might happen if he put busy Americans into that environment. How would they sleep? He organized a study to find out. He and his colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health recruited 15 young, healthy adult volunteers. They went about their normal business during the day, then reported to a sleep lab in the early evening. "We had our subjects go into the dark at 6 p.m., lie down and rest," Wehr says. The lights didn't come back on until 8 the next morning; it was a simulated winter day. The sleep study found that the long night led to two bouts of concentrated sleep  with a wakeful period in the middle, lasting a few hours. The study was published in the American Journal of Physiology in 1993. "You might think that lying awake for two hours would be a kind of torture," Wehr says. "But it wasn't at all." The people in the sleep study described it as a kind of quiescent, meditative state. Researchers found similar results in a more recent study of adolescents. The longer night seems to give rise to a sort of "midnight comfort." Sleep Patterns To many of us, the notion of staying in bed  or in the dark  for 12 hours may seem ridiculous or a waste of time. In modern culture, we've adapted to a more efficient way of sleeping: consolidating it into one long stretch. This works for many people, but as we age, sleep changes. "Sleep tends to be more fragile in general as we age," says Mary Carskadon, who directs chronobiology and sleep research at Brown University. One way to assess the age-related changes in sleep is to look at brain waves. "When we're little, we have a lot of very high, slow brain waves at the beginning of the night," Carskadon says. "And that seems to be the best, most restorative kind of sleep." But as the decades go by, these peaks diminish. If adolescent brain waves are the Himalayas, then by early adulthood, they're Rocky Mountain peaks. And in the elderly: think Appalachians or just foothills. As we age, it's easier to wake us, Carskadon explains, "because those high, slow waves are very protective for disturbances in the environment"  things such as a snoring partner, or a barking dog. Getting Enough Zzzzzzzz So, if interruptions in sleep are to be expected, what's the best strategy for getting enough of it? One option is to embrace a longer night. This may work for people who have very flexible schedules, or for those who are retired. "They can afford, arguably, to spend more time in bed," says Jack Edinger, a sleep expert at Duke University. He says the middle-of-night wake time may not be anxiety-provoking if you know you're going to get another bout of morning sleep. There's also the siesta model  with naps in the afternoon. But for those of us who need to get up and work all day? There are strategies that can help people consolidate sleep. One technique, according to Edinger, is to tightly restrict the number of hours in bed. This encourages more efficient sleep. Edinger stresses that sleep requirements vary from person to person. Six to nine hours is the normal range. But "there are people who fall outside that range and do just fine," he says. The important thing is to get a good handle on the dose of sleep YOU need, he says. Set your pattern  and stick with it each night. Most of us will find that's seven or eight hours. Recent studies suggest that people who get less than seven hours each night tend to be more susceptible to the common cold and weight gain. 
 5 Reasons You May Be Tired by Dr. Deborah Serani Monday, August 03, 2009 I was reading this article written by Dr. Mark Liponis in Parade magazine regarding reasons that might cause fatigue. So if you find yourself tired or yearning for some zzz's, check out the overview of his suggestions below: 1. Sleep Disorders Two common medical sleep disordersobstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome could be responsible for getting in the way of a good night's sleep. Remedy: Talk about your concerns to your physician. From there, a series of tests will help you discover if you have either of these disruptive, yet treatable, sleep disorders. 2. Thyroid Conditions The thyroid regulates your mood, metabolism heart rate and energy levels - just to name a few. The thyroid is a tricky gland. You can experience sluggishness or fatigue with either an underactive or even an overactive thyroid. Remedy: Makes sure your thyroid function has been properly tested. If it's been a while since you've had a full physical, stop reading this, get on the phone and make an appointment! 3. Diabetes Diabetes has reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. and nearly 25 % of people with diabetes dont even know they have it! Besides fatigue, its common for people with diabetes to experience weight gain, increased appetite, thirst, frequent urination, and blurred vision. Remedy: The good news is that Type 2 diabetes can be helped and even prevented with proper diet, exercise, and weight loss. Diabetes can be detected with a simple blood test, so if youre having symptoms or are at increased risk, dont waitget a checkup. 4. Depression Depression, which often has symptoms of tiredness and fatigue, affects more than 20 million Americans and is a major cause of disability. Depression is a real illness, not a result of a flawed character or laziness. Remedy: Make an appointment to see your physician or contact a mental health professional. Most depressive disorders can be effectively treated with medication, therapy or a combination of the two. 5. Anemia This common medical condition occurs when there is a reduced number of red blood cellsthe cells that carry oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and the rest of your body. Because less oxygen is delivered to the muscles and tissues, you feel tired. You also may experience shortness of breath or a faster pulse. Remedy: Again, see your physician. A simple blood test will determine if you are anemic or iron deficient. It would be important to discover the reasons for being iron deficient as well. Treatment usually includes the taking of iron supplements. I have restless legs, depression and iron poor blood. And though I sleep pretty well at night, I find myself tired from time to time during the day. With the help of health professionals, I take iron supplements, monitor my clinical depression with medication, moderate my restless legs with a multivitamin trio, and catnap nearly everyday. These interventions definitely help. So, if your dragging or perpetually pounding the pillow, talk to your health professional. 
 Dreams Help Us Process Emotion by Marks Psychiatry Friday, July 10, 2009 Some people remember their dreams vividly well after they wake up. For others, the tenuous memory of dreams begins to slip away with the first flicker of wakefulness. An inability to remember our dreams does not lessen their impact. New research indicates that a powerful connection exists between our nightly dreams and our ability to process human emotions during the day. In research presented at the annual conference of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, researchers at the University of California-Berkeley found that people require adequate sleep to understand complex emotions. “Sleep essentially is resetting the magnetic north of your emotional compass,” Matthew Walker, director of the University of California-Berkeley Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab, told Time in an online article. In the study, adults who took a 60- to 90-minute nap and reached REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, the sleep stage where most dreaming occurs, were more likely to identify positive emotions like happiness when looking at photos of other people. Those who did not achieve REM sleep or did not nap more often identified negative emotions like fear and anger. Our response may be rooted in evolution. In previous research at Harvard Medical School, Walker found that activity in the prefrontal lobe, the brain area that controls emotion, diminished when people were sleep deprived. “If you’re walking through the jungle and you’re tired, it might benefit you more to be hypersensitive to negative things,” he explained. When mental energy lags, self-preservation forces us to focus on immediate threats. When we’re rested, we’re more likely to tune in to positive emotions associated with long-term survival like personal relationships and food. REM, or dream, sleep “tries to ameliorate the sharp emotional chips and dents that life gives you along the way,” Walker explains. “It’s not that you’ve forgotten. You haven’t. It’s a memory of an emotional episode, but it’s no longer emotional itself. If you don’t let go of the emotion, what results is a constant state of anxiety.” People who experience insomnia or other sleep disorders that prevent them from entering REM sleep lose the restorative power of sleep necessary to good health. When sleep problems interfere with the mind’s opportunity to process emotions, chronic insomnia can lead to the development of psychiatric disorders. 
 Meditation, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Treat Insomnia Without Drugs By Jennifer Warner WebMD Health News Reviewed by Louise Chang, MD June 9, 2009 -- Changing bad sleep habits and clearing the mind with meditation may offer drug-free alternatives to traditional insomnia treatments. Two new studies suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy to change people’s attitudes and actions about sleep and using meditation to encourage relaxation can help insomniacs get a better night’s sleep without pills. Researchers say that contrary to popular belief, insomnia is not a nighttime-only affliction but a 24-hour problem of hyperarousal. By teaching people how to relax and clear their minds during the day, they sleep better at night. "Results of the study show that teaching deep relaxation techniques during the daytime can help improve sleep at night," says researcher Ramadevi Gourineni, MD, director of the insomnia program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, in a news release. Meditation to Treat Insomnia Gourineni’s study examined the effectiveness of practicing meditation as an insomnia treatment in 11 people with insomnia. The participants were divided into two groups. One group was trained in kriya yoga, in which meditation is used to focus internalized attention, and the other received general health education. Two months later, the results showed that the meditation group experienced improvements in sleep quality and quantity, according to their sleep diaries. They also took less time to fall asleep, woke fewer times, and had fewer symptoms of depression. Although the effects and study size were small, researchers say the findings suggest that meditation may be an effective alternative insomnia treatment. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Tames Insomnia The second, larger study looked at the effects of a cognitive behavioral therapy-insomnia (CBT-I) program designed to treat insomnia in 115 people with insomnia. The program included evaluating the person’s habits, attitudes, and knowledge about sleep. During the treatment sessions, participants learned about sleep scheduling, creating the proper environment for sleep, reducing stimuli that may interfere with sleep, relaxation training, and mindfulness training. "CBT-I teaches strategies to 'reset' the bodily systems that regulate sleep," researcher Ryan Wetzler, PsyD, of Sleep Medicine Specialists in Louisville, Ky., says in a news release. "Since these systems also play a role in regulation of mood, pain, and other bodily processes, skills developed through CBT-I may also have a positive impact on mood, anxiety, pain, and other associated medical or psychiatric conditions." The results showed that 50%-60% of those whose main insomnia symptom was trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both experienced improvement. Those who completed five or more cognitive behavioral therapy sessions also had improvement in other sleep quality measurements and needed less medication for their insomnia. 
 Sleep & Mental Illness Reviewed By: Steven A. King, M.D. About sleep and mental illness People diagnosed with mental illness often have related sleep problems. In most cases, a person’s sleep problem will progress in tandem with the underlying mental health disorder responsible for the disruption of sleep. Sleep problems often emerge early in the illness, before symptoms characteristic of the mental illness even begin to appear. Most often, sleep problems related to mental illness involve one of two conditions: Insomnia. Condition in which a patient has trouble falling asleep or remaining asleep. Typically, patients with insomnia do not feel refreshed after a night’s sleep.Hypersomnia. Condition that causes people to feel extremely sleepy throughout the day. Patients with hypersomnia also often sleep for long periods at night and nap repeatedly during the day. However, this sleep does not leave the person feeling refreshed or more alert. A large number of mental illnesses – ranging from the anxiety disorder post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to postpartum depression – can cause sleep problems such as insomnia and hypersomnia. For example, all forms of depression are commonly associated with sleep problems. People who are depressed often experience bouts of insomnia that may cause them to have difficulty falling asleep, remaining asleep or falling back asleep after waking early in the morning. Less frequently, depressed patients may have problems with hypersomnia that cause them to sleep excessively. Sleep consists of five stages, the first four of which are called non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Stage 1 is the transition from being awake to sleeping, stage 2 is an intermediate level of sleep, and the third and fourth stages may be referred to as deep sleep or slow wave sleep. The fourth stage is also known as delta sleep, which is the deepest type of sleep. During delta sleep, growth hormone, which regulates cell division and protein synthesis necessary for growth, is produced. The fifth stage of sleep is called REM sleep. Dreaming occurs during this stage. Sleep is an active, complex process that involves the brain in multiple ways. Mental illnesses often associated with sleep problems such as hypersomnia and insomnia include:Adjustment disorders. Conditions in which a person has an excessive reaction to a stressful life event, such as starting school or getting divorced. Insomnia often accompanies these conditions.Bipolar disorder. Condition in which periods of excitability (mania) alternate with episodes of depression. Hypersomnia is often associated with this condition.Generalized anxiety disorder. Condition in which a person displays frequent patterns of worrying about activities or events. Patients with this condition often report insomnia that makes it difficult to fall asleep and that may cause them to awaken with feelings of anxiety during the night.Panic disorder. Condition marked by recurrent episodes of intense fear and anxiety that may last for minutes to hours. Patients with this condition may experience panic attacks in the middle of the night that cause them to awaken and to then struggle to fall asleep afterward.Personality disorders. Conditions marked by inflexibility in perceiving, reacting to and relating to people and events. People with personality disorders often have impaired social skills. Insomnia often accompanies these conditions.Schizophrenia. People with this condition struggle to distinguish between real and unreal experiences. They may not think logically or have normal emotional responses to others. Insomnia often accompanies periods when symptoms related to schizophrenia intensify.Somatoform disorders. Condition in which patient complaints of persistent or chronic symptoms of physical illness are believed to be at least partially associated with a mental health condition. Insomnia often accompanies somatoform disorders.Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). People with SAD typically experience symptoms of depression in the winter months, but not in the spring or summer months. Sleep problems associated with SAD include oversleeping, difficulty staying awake during the day, disturbed sleep and, in some cases, waking exceptionally early in the morning. The treatment for certain mental health disorders may predispose the patient to developing sleep problems. For example, prescription medications to treat anxiety disorders (e.g., benzodiazepines) interrupt the normal sleep cycle by increasing the amount of stage two sleep and decreasing the amount of sleep in stages three and four and REM sleep. The deeper sleep received during stages three and four is a necessary part of the restorative function of sleep. Signs and symptoms of sleep and mental illness People who have a sleep problem associated with mental illness are likely to display two sets of symptoms. The first set of symptoms is related to the mental disorder itself. These vary from condition to condition. The second set of symptoms is related to the sleep problem. For example, patients with insomnia may experience any of the following symptoms: Increased anxiety at bedtimeTendency to spend too much time in bedImprovement in sleep patterns once the patient is removed from the typical sleep environment Patients experiencing hypersomnia may exhibit symptoms such as: Fatigue or complete lack of energyDifficulty concentratingTendency to fall asleep easily in low-stimulation situationsFeelings of disorientation upon wakingDecreased appetiteIrritabilityMemory impairment Diagnosis/treatment of sleep and mental illness When patients have both a mental illness and a sleep problem, both should be addressed because each can precipitate or exacerbate the other. At times, treating the mental illness may result in a substantial improvement in the sleep problem, too. For example, patients who are diagnosed with depression often benefit from a combination of psychotherapy and the use of antidepressant medications. Once the depression is successfully treated, the sleep problem may disappear. However, if a patient’s complaints are primarily focused on sleep problems, one of two diagnoses may be made according to the criteria established by the American Psychiatric Association (APA): insomnia related to another mental disorder or hypersomnia related to another mental disorder. Insomnia related to another mental disorder is diagnosed in patients who have difficulty falling asleep, remaining asleep or achieving restful sleep over a period of at least one month. The disturbance must be related to a type of mental health disorder and must cause significant impairment in social, occupational or other areas of functioning. It must be severe enough that it requires specific attention in addition to the attention paid to the mental disorder. Finally, the insomnia cannot be better accounted for by another sleep disorder, and cannot be due to the use of certain substances or existence of certain medical conditions. This condition is diagnosed in between 35 and 50 percent of patients whose chronic insomnia is evaluated by a sleep study at a sleep disorder center, according to the APA. Hypersomnia related to another mental disorder is diagnosed when over a period of at least one month, patients experience excessive sleepiness marked by prolonged sleep or daytime sleep that occurs nearly every day. The disturbance must be related to a mental health disorder and cause significant impairment in social, occupational or other areas of functioning. It also must be severe enough that it warrants specific treatment in addition to the attention paid to the mental disorder. The hypersomnia must not be more clearly related to another sleep disorder and must not be caused by simply not getting enough sleep, in order to meet the APA criteria. Finally, the hypersomnia cannot be due to use of certain substances or existence of certain medical conditions. This condition is diagnosed in fewer than 5 percent of patients whose hypersomnia is evaluated by a sleep study at a sleep disorder center, according to the APA. In some cases, symptoms of insomnia or hypersomnia may continue even after a mental illness has been treated effectively. In such situations, a new diagnosis of primary insomnia or primary hypersomnia may be made. Finally, some sleep problems thought to be linked to a mental health condition are actually associated with physical illness. For example, patients with an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) may experience chronic insomnia. Successfully treating the physical illness usually alleviates the associated sleep problem. Questions for your doctor Preparing questions in advance can help patients to have more meaningful discussions with their physicians regarding their conditions. Patients may wish to ask their doctor the following questions related to sleep and mental illness: What is causing my sleep difficulties?Do you suspect that my sleep problems are related to a mental illness?What type of mental illness do you suspect I have?How will you diagnose my mental illness?Do I have to prepare in any special way for the diagnostic tests?What are my treatment options?What are the side effects of these treatments?How soon after beginning treatment will I see improvement in my sleep?What happens if many of my symptoms improve, but my sleep problems remain?Are there other steps I can take to improve the quality of my sleep? 
 i am now 23 years old, and i just realized that its not normal or ordinary to have always visual images when eyes were closed. i hope i am in the right place here, and maybe what i have is explainable and could be answered. its almost certain, that when i closed my eyes, there is always images, even i don't think about them. I have a bit control on those images i can move them shift them, etc.. but they are always dynamic moving and they are vivid. i always could tell what are they ranging from animals to spacey looks to architectural, airplanes, ghost like people, abstract statue... and they all shifting moving and i don't need to try to think of it. i live in Indonesia and i doubt anybody would concern or care about this. i always thought everybody has it too. i don't remember how long i has it but i can recall from very early age. i hope it is not a form of schizophrenia i look forward to know what is this called in medical term, thank you Brian. 
 Stop sleep thieves and get more Zzzs By Camille Noe Pagán Prevention Sun., May 17, 2009 How to fight a hyperactive brain, insomnia and snoring to get better rest A good night's sleep is as easy as slipping under the covers and closing your eyes  right? If only. More than half of American women say they sleep well only a few nights a week, reports a National Sleep Foundation survey. "Sleep issues are common for women over 40  and usually very solvable," says sleep specialist Rubin Naiman, PhD, a clinical assistant professor of medicine at the University of Arizona's Center for Integrative Medicine. "With simple lifestyle changes, you can improve the quality of sleep, as well as mood and overall well-being." Here's how he helped three women get the shut-eye they need for optimal health and happiness. Sleep thief: Hyperactive brain Margot Tohn, 44, is a self-described overachiever: On top of running her own publishing company, she takes care of her ailing father, volunteers for several charity organizations, and tries to play tennis with friends or go to the opera once a week. Her list of to-dos and obligations never ends, yet she often feels as though she's not doing enough. Even after she turns in for the night, her mind is still going, running through what she accomplished that day and planning for the next. She doesn't actually get to sleep until 1 to 2 a.m., then wakes at about 5:30, feeling anxious to get started. By the afternoon, Margot feels irritable and in desperate need of a nap. Our expert says: "This sleep problem is primarily psychological," explains Naiman. "Margot is entirely too hard on herself, and all that ruminating creates anxiety, which shifts the brain into high-alert mode instead of allowing it to wind down." When she starts to criticize herself or feel guilty about not running an errand right away for her family, for example, she needs to stop and think: Am I really hurting anyone by not doing this immediately? Taking a second to think rationally will help her calm down. The other problem is that Margot's day is too jam-packed, adds Naiman. "She has no alone time to process her thoughts, so her mind essentially makes up for it at night." This pre-bed routine will help her mind and body relax: Unplug an hour before bed. That includes the television, computer, cell phone, and any other glowing tech tools. Research shows that the brain misreads artificial light as daylight, so it doesn't release melatonin, a sleep-regulating chemical, which is normally triggered by darkness.Take a warm shower or bath. Your body temperature goes down when you get out, which makes you feel sleepy. That's because it mimics what occurs deep inside the body at night, when internal temperature drops to its lowest level.Meditate or pray for 10 minutes. Several studies show that it can help reduce anxiety, release negative thinking, and improve sleep. Sit quietly in a comfortable position and repeat a phrase you find relaxing, such as Keep letting go. How it worked: "Though I'm not sleeping for 8 hours a night yet, the quality of my sleep has definitely improved because I'm much more energized during the day. The relaxation routine took me a little while to get used to: I never meditated before, so at first, I could sit quietly for only about 2 minutes at a time. I eventually worked up to 10 minutes, and it does help ease my mind. I also take a hot shower at night and do a few stretches before I go to bed, which relaxes my body. Plus, I started to realize that my all-or-nothing attitude wasn't doing me any favors, so on nights when I get home late, I make sure to do my pre-bed routine for even just 10 to 20 minutes, instead of forgoing it entirely because I don't have a full hour." Key move: Keep a journal. "I make a list each night of 10 things I am grateful for  from good friends to a good hair day. I feel less anxious when I take a few minutes to focus on how much I'm blessed." Sleep thief: Waking up four times a night Virginia Camasca, 40, has battled insomnia for 5 years, trying all sorts of things, from herbs to special diets, with no success. At night, she spends up to an hour trying to get comfortable before eventually dozing off, but then she wakes up several times before the alarm rings  often to use the bathroom, sometimes just because. She used to dream frequently but now rarely does, which some research suggests is a sign of poor quality sleep. But when she tried taking the sleep supplement melatonin, she had nightmares. Virginia's insomnia leaves her stressed-out and so exhausted that sometimes she even dozes at work. Our expert says: "Virginia is stuck in a vicious cycle  the more she agonizes about not sleeping, the harder it is for her to nod off," says Naiman. Stress keeps the mind active and triggers the release of chemicals that rouse the nervous system  all of which sabotage slumber. There's no doubt Virginia is waking up too often, but once or twice during the night is normal. Knowing that may alleviate some of the negative feelings she has toward nighttime. A more relaxed mindset  and the following tips  will up the odds she gets better quality sleep: Limit liquids after 6 p.m. The reason she wakes up so often to use the bathroom is simply because she drinks too much fluid during the second half of the day. After 6 p.m., have just one to two glasses of water; also do 10 to 20 Kegel exercises daily, which strengthen the bladder. (To do Kegels, clench only the muscles that control the flow of urine.)Set a bedtime and stick to it. Going to bed at different times throws the internal body clock out of whack. It's better if she hit the sack at the same time every night and set the alarm for the same time every morning  even on weekends, suggests Naiman. This will help get her body on a regular pattern, which makes it easier to fall and stay asleep.Try a small dose of melatonin. The brain makes this chemical naturally, but it's often in short supply in people with insomnia. Studies have shown that taking a melatonin supplement helps improve sleep, but you need only a small amount: 0.5 mg, 15 minutes before bed. Last time Virginia tried it, she took 3 times as much, and that can cause side effects like nightmares or even depression. Before taking any supplement, talk with your primary care doc. How it worked: "I started taking melatonin after a checkup with my doctor, and it seemed to work right away, helping me fall asleep faster than I had in forever  and I'm dreaming good dreams again. Keeping a bedtime was tough at first, but now it feels normal to be in bed by 10. And because I have only one glass of water with dinner and did Kegels regularly, I wake up less often to use the bathroom and sometimes sleep straight until the morning. I'm thrilled that I feel so relaxed and healthy. Friends who didn't know I was doing this program tell me I've never looked better. I guess there is such a thing as beauty rest!" Key move: Hide the time. "I turn my alarm clock away from me so I can't count the minutes I'm awake if I get up in the middle of the night. That way, I'm less stressed if I wake up, so it's easier to drift off again." Sleep thief: Night sweats and heavy snoring Tracy Lobdell, 52, has gained more than 50 pounds over the past 5 years  and it's taking a toll on her sleep habits. She snores heavily and suspects she may have sleep apnea, a serious condition that occurs when a person stops breathing for seconds at a time because of airway obstructions, which are often caused or made worse by excess body fat. She recently lost a few pounds by adopting a healthier diet and practicing portion control, but she never has the time or energy to exercise. Tracy is also in the throes of menopause and suffers from hot flashes and night sweats. Plus, her husband and dog  both of whom share her bed  snore, too, and there's barely room for the three of them on their queen-size mattress. The result: Tracy tosses and turns all night and is moody, unproductive, and tired during the day. Our expert says: "Severe snoring, weight gain, and significant daytime drowsiness all indicate possible sleep apnea," says Naiman. "But even if Tracy doesn't have the condition, snoring can make it difficult for her to get into the deep stages of sleep." Although it's a good idea that she get tested for apnea, Tracy can help ease snoring and other possible apnea symptoms by keeping up the weight loss. To slim down even faster, she should add 30 minutes of aerobic exercise to her routine 5 or 6 days a week, says Naiman. Shedding extra pounds may ease night sweats too. And to sleep more soundly, she should try these bedtime tweaks: Switch to the side. Sleeping on the back, as Tracy does now, isn't ideal for heavy snorers or people with apnea  it allows the soft palate to hang in a direction that can obstruct breathing. Sleeping on either side, however, opens up airways to alleviate breathing issues. To help stay in this position, Naiman suggests propping one pillow behind your back and another in front of your waist.Make the bed a pet-free zone. Tuck the pooch into a doggie bed in another room. When Tracy shares her sleeping space with her pet, it gives her little room to move, and though she may not realize it, her dog's fidgeting and kicking wakes her throughout the night.Keep the bedroom cool. Exactly how cool depends on your preference, but Naiman suggests around 68°F. Wear lightweight pajamas, and cover up with a sheet instead of a blanket. This will help reduce the severity of night sweats. How it worked: "For the first time in years, I actually feel well rested. I plan to get tested for apnea, but I'm already falling asleep much faster, and my hot flashes are less frequent and severe. I even got used to sleeping on my side. The toughest part for me was making my dog sleep in the other room. I felt guilty, but it really is so much more comfortable. Instead, I let her spend 10 minutes in bed with me in the morning  I think of it as trading quantity for quality. I've continued to lose weight by watching my diet  I've dropped 10 pounds and counting. I haven't made time for exercise yet, but I definitely have more energy now, so it's next on my list." Key move: Cut back caffeine. "I used to drink about six glasses of iced black and orange tea every day. Dr. Naiman suggested that I switch to decaf or 100 percent iced green tea, which can have half as much caffeine. Now in the mornings I have a little black and orange tea, but in the afternoon, I stick to green. I actually don't miss the caffeine at all." 
 Rewriting Your Nightmares New York Times Blog October 31, 2008 Halloween is filled with the stuff of nightmares — costumed ghosts, vampires and slasher-movie monsters. But for some people, nightmares aren’t holiday fun. As many as 25 percent of adults have at least one nightmare a month. For a troubled 7 to 8 percent of the population, nightmares interrupt sleep at least once a week. But many people don’t realize that having chronic nightmares is a medical problem that can be treated. A nightmare is a complex dream that can cause high levels of anxiety and terror. Nightmares typically interrupt sleep as the mind plays out frightening scenes that involve imminent harm, like being chased, threatened or injured. For people who suffer from post-traumatic stress, nightmares tend to involve reliving the original horror of the traumatic event. It’s believed that nightmares occur when the brain is struggling to process stress or severe trauma. But for some people, the bad dreams essentially become a learned behavior, and the brain gets stuck in a pattern of troubling nightmares. In the past, therapists have encouraged patients to talk about their nightmares in hopes of resolving the underlying issues that cause them. But more recently, therapists have adopted “imagery rehearsal therapy,” a pioneering technique developed by Dr. Barry Krakow at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine. Instead of focusing on the bad dream, imagery therapy looks for ways to rewrite a nightmare’s script. The concern is that talking too much about a troubling dream may serve to reinforce it. Imagery rehearsal therapy allows the dreamer to rewrite the nightmare during the day. After practicing basic imagery techniques — imagining yourself on a beach or eating a hamburger, for example — the troubled dreamer chooses a better version of the dream, explains Shelby Harris, clinical psychologist at the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Hospital in New York. “We mention the nightmare once and forget about it,” Dr. Harris said. “I tell patients to change it anyway they wish. You can change a tiny bit of it, or change the whole thing.” The key is to “practice” the new version of the dream by imagining it a few times during the day. While the method is highly successful, helping about 70 percent of people who try it, it can work differently in different people. Some develop the ability to change the nightmare while they are having it. One patient of Dr. Harris was troubled by a dream in which she was attacked by sharks. During imagery therapy, the patient chose to change the sharks into dolphins. When she started to have the nightmare during her sleep, the sharks also changed into dolphins. Other sufferers notice that after therapy the nightmares disappear and the general quality of all their dreams starts to turn more positive. The therapy treatment is typically brief, lasting only two or three sessions. Children can also be taught the technique. “Practicing imagery during the day and changing imagery can really affect your imagery at night,” Dr. Harris said. Dr. Harris said people suffering from occasional nightmares can try rewriting the script of their nightmares on their own. But people who are waking often from nightmares or who are developing insomnia or a fear of sleeping should seek professional help before the problem becomes severe. “If you’re having a nightmare at night, you’re waking up, which makes you tired during the day, and you’re thinking about it,” Dr. Harris said. “Because it’s distressing, that causes more stress, which can cause more nightmares at night. It’s a cycle many people can’t break.” To learn more, visit Dr. Krakow’s Nightmare Treatment Center Web page and take the nightmare quiz to help determine your risk for a nightmare disorder. And read Natalie Angier’s recent column on nightmares. 
 A recurring part of my nightmare is I'm somewhere, (it can be an enclosed room or a lonely deserted shopping centre, etc), and I know I am going to be attacked or I am being attacked; sometimes there are people around me, or everything is desolate but I can't get anyone to hear me or get any help at all. Sometimes I see people I know right next to me but they can't hear me. So I've wondered about before I go to sleep holding on to a piece of paper that has a drawing of an emergency button that I tell myself before I go to sleep that I can press it if I need help and it will raise the alarm and then I'll get some help. I'm hoping that this will filter through into my nightmare and I can squeeze my hand and it will start to change my nightmare. I'm still looking into Imagery Rehearsal Therapy and prepared to try a lot of things to change to pattern of my nightmares. Has anyone here tried anything like this before? If so, has it worked or have you any other ideas that have helped? Many thanks NightOwl 
 What Do Dreams Mean? Whatever Your Bias Says By JOHN TIERNEY, New York Times March 10, 2009 Suppose last night you had two dreams. In one, God appears and commands you to take a year off and travel the world. In the other, God commands you to take a year off to go work in a leper colony. Which of those dreams, if either, would you consider meaningful? Or suppose you had one dream in which your friend defends you against enemies, and another dream in which that same friend goes behind your back and tries to seduce your significant other? Which dream would you take seriously? Tough questions, but social scientists now have answers  and really, its about time. For thousands of years, dreamers have had little more to go on than the two-gate hypothesis proposed in The Odyssey. After Penelope dreams of the return of her lost-long husband, shes skeptical and says that only some dreams matter. There are two gates, she explains, through which these unsubstantial fancies proceed; the one is of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come through the gate of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn mean something to those that see them. Her two-gate hypothesis, later endorsed by Virgil and Ovid, was elegant in theory but not terribly useful in practice. How could you tell which gate your dream came from? One womans ivory could be anothers horn. Today, though, we can start making distinctions, thanks to a series of studies of more than 1,000 people by two psychologists, Carey Morewedge of Carnegie Mellon University and Michael Norton of Harvard (you can report your dreams to these researchers at TierneyLab). The psychologists began by asking college students in three countries  India, South Korea and the United States  how much significance they attached to dreams. Relatively few students believed in modern theories that dreaming is simply the brains response to random impulses, or that its a mechanism for sorting and discarding information. Instead, the majority in all three countries believed, along with Freud, that dreams reveal important unconscious emotions. These instinctive Freudians also considered dreams to be valuable omens, as demonstrated in a study asking them to imagine they were about to take a plane trip. If, on the eve of the flight, they dreamed of the planes crashing, they were more likely to cancel the trip than if they saw news of an actual plane crash on their route. But when the researchers asked people to interpret dreams, some suspiciously convenient correlations turned up. When asked to recall their own dreams, they attached more significance to a negative dream if it was about someone they disliked, and they gave correspondingly more weight to a positive dream if it was about a friend. A similar bias showed up when people were asked to imagine that they had had various dreams starring a friend or a deity. People rated a dream about a friend protecting them against attackers as being more meaningful than a dream about their own romantic partner faithlessly kissing that same friend. People who believed in God were more likely than agnostics to be swayed by divine apparitions. But even the nonbelievers showed a weakness for certain heavenly dreams, like one in which God commanded them to take a year off to travel the world. Agnostics rated that dream as significantly more meaningful than the dream of God commanding them to spend a year working in a leper colony. (Incidentally, although the preferred term for leprosy is now Hansens disease, the deity in the experiment used the old-fashioned term from the Bible.) Dreamers self-serving bias is tactfully defined as a motivated approach to dream interpretation by Dr. Morewedge and Dr. Norton in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. When asked if this motivated approach might also affect dream researchers, Dr. Morewedge pointed to Freuds tendency to find what he was looking for  sex  in his Interpretation of Dreams. Freud himself suggested that dreams of flying revealed thoughts of sexual desire, Dr. Morewedge noted. Interestingly, in the same text, Freud also suggested that dreams about the absence of the ability to fly  i.e., falling  also indicate succumbing to sexual desire. One might interpret this as evidence that scientists are just as self-serving as laypeople when interpreting their dreams. Once you see how flexible dream interpretation can be, you can appreciate why it has always been such a popular tool for decision-making. Relying on your dreams for guidance is like the political ritual of appointing an independent blue-ribbon panel to resolve an issue. You can duck any personal responsibility for action while pretending to rely on an impartial process, even though youve stacked the panel with your own friends and will ignore any advice that conflicts with your desires. Charity work, no; margaritas, sí. Even if you dont believe in your own dreams, the new research suggests that you can learn something from those of others. In the Book of Genesis, when the Pharaoh becomes concerned over his dreams of emaciated cattle and withered ears of corn, it would not be unreasonable for Joseph to conclude that the ruler is worried about the possibility of famine. Joseph would therefore have every motivation to interpret the dream so that the Pharaoh creates a new grain-storage program  and, not incidentally, a new job for Joseph supervising it. While they doubt that dreams contain hidden insights or prophecies, Dr. Morewedge and Dr. Norton note that dreams can be indicators of peoples emotional state, as evidenced by other researchers findings of a correlation between stress and nightmares. Dreams can also become self-fulfilling prophecies simply because people take them so seriously, Dr. Morewedge and Dr. Norton say. Dreams of spousal infidelity may lead to accusations and acrimony that ultimately lead to real infidelity. When friends and loved ones have disturbing dreams, Dr. Morewedge suggested, one may need to do more than say, It was just a dream. It may also be a good idea not to tell people about their undesirable behavior in your dreams, as they may infer that your dreams reveal your true feelings about them. This last caveat applies even when non-Freudians are discussing dreams. Even if you dont ascribe any deep meaning to dreams, even if you think theyre just random hallucinations that dont come from gates of ivory or horn or anything else, you should still probably pay attention when, say, your romantic partner tells you about a dream in which you were caught in bed with your partners friend. And you should definitely be concerned if your partner goes on to mention a second dream involving a commandment from God to take a year off and travel the world. If your partner is a highly motivated interpreter of dreams, you may find yourself home alone. 
 People With Insomnia May Be Plagued for Awhile Serious sleep problems often last a year or more, study finds WEDNESDAY, March 11 (HealthDay News) -- Insomnia is a persistent condition for many people, a new study finds. Canadian researchers found that about 75 percent of those with insomnia experience the condition for at least a year, and almost half experience it for three years. Over a three-year span, the researchers evaluated insomnia persistence, remission and relapse in 388 people, who averaged about 45 years old. They compared 269 people with insomnia symptoms with 119 people who had what they termed insomnia syndrome -- meaning they had insomnia symptoms at least three nights a week for at least a month, causing substantial distress or daytime drowsiness. "Of the study sample, 74 percent reported insomnia for at least one year, and 46 percent reported insomnia persisting over the entire three-year study," wrote the researchers, who were from Laval University in Quebec. People with insomnia syndrome had a higher insomnia persistence rate (66.1 percent) than those with insomnia symptoms (37.2 percent). About 54 percent of everyone in the study went into insomnia remission, but 26.7 percent of them eventually relapsed. Of the 269 people with insomnia symptoms at the start of the study, 38.4 percent were classified as good sleepers after a year, 48.7 percent still had insomnia symptoms, and 12.9 percent had insomnia syndrome. Among the 119 people with insomnia syndrome at the start of the study, 17 percent were good sleepers after a year, 37 percent still had symptoms of insomnia, and 46 percent still had insomnia syndrome. The findings were published in the March 9 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine. "This study provides preliminary evidence to better understand the natural course of insomnia," the authors wrote. "Additional studies are needed, however, to identify moderating and mediating factors of persistence, remission and relapse." About 30 percent of adults report symptoms of insomnia, and 6 percent to 10 percent meet diagnostic criteria for an insomnia disorder, according to background information in the study. Insomnia risk factors include being female, older, having anxiety or depression, and experiencing pain. Insomnia has been linked to depression, hypertension, disability, work absenteeism and higher health-care costs. 
 When Dreaming Is Believing: Dreams Affect People's Judgment, Behavior ScienceDaily Feb. 17, 2009 While science tries to understand the stuff dreams are made of, humans, from cultures all over the world, continue to believe that dreams contain important hidden truths, according to newly published research. In six different studies, researchers surveyed nearly 1,100 people about their dreams. "Psychologists' interpretations of the meaning of dreams vary widely," said Carey Morewedge, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University and the study's lead author. "But our research shows that people believe their dreams provide meaningful insight into themselves and their world." The article appears in the February issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, published by the American Psychological Association. In one study that surveyed general beliefs about dreams, Morewedge and co-author Michael Norton, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School, surveyed 149 university students in the United States, India and South Korea. The researchers asked the students to rate different theories about dreams. Across all three cultures, an overwhelming majority of the students endorsed the theory that dreams reveal hidden truths about themselves and the world, a belief also endorsed by a nationally representative sample of Americans. In another study reported in the article, the researchers wanted to explore how dreams might influence people's waking behavior. They surveyed 182 commuters at a Boston train station, asking them to imagine that one of four possible scenarios had happened the night before a scheduled airline trip: The national threat level was raised to orange, indicating a high risk of terrorist attack; they consciously thought about their plane crashing; they dreamed about a plane crash; or a real plane crash occurred on the route they planned to take. A dream of a plane crash was more likely to affect travel plans than either thinking about a crash or a government warning, and the dream of a plane crash produced a similar level of anxiety as did an actual crash. Finally, the researchers wanted to find out whether people perceive all dreams as equally meaningful, or whether their interpretations were influenced by their waking beliefs and desires. In another study, 270 men and women from across the United States took a short online survey in which they were asked to remember a dream they had had about a person they knew. People ascribed more importance to pleasant dreams about a person they liked as compared to a person they did not like, while they were more likely to consider an unpleasant dream more meaningful if it was about a person they disliked. "In other words," said Morewedge, "people attribute meaning to dreams when it corresponds with their pre-existing beliefs and desires. This was also the case in another experiment which demonstrated that people who believe in God were likely to consider any dream in which God spoke to them to be meaningful; agnostics, however, considered dreams in which God spoke to be more meaningful when God commanded them to take a pleasant vacation than when God commanded them to engage in self-sacrifice." The authors say more research is needed to explore fully how people interpret their dreams, and in what cases dreams may actually reveal hidden information.. "Most people understand that dreams are unlikely to predict the future but that doesn't prevent them from finding meaning in their dreams, whether their contents are mundane or bizarre," said Morewedge.

 Women Have More Nightmares Than Men, Study Shows ScienceDaily Jan. 28, 2009 A researcher from the University of the West of England was inspired by her own nightmares and a chance encounter at a lecture to examine more closely the stuff that dreams are made of. Her PhD study has focused on an astounding discovery that women suffer more nightmares then men. As a mature student Dr Jennie Parker was interested in looking at some aspect of psychology for her PhD study and it was at a lecture about dreams, given by former UWE researcher Dr Susan Blackmore that she had a moment of epiphany. Dr Parker explains, My own nightmares had two reoccurring themes, one concerned standing on the beach at Weston Super Mare, my home town, when the tide suddenly goes out very fast and returns as a huge tidal wave that is about to engulf me. The other dream includes a dinosaur roaming the streets at night and looking in at my window. I wondered if my experience was common amongst women. Several years on and Dr Parker has completed a study that looks set to turn Dream Research on its head and expand its potential as a subject with multi faceted possibilities hitherto unrealised. In the course of her work she found that research into sleep and dreams had used data collection techniques that discounted entirely the role of emotions in dreams. She believes that this discovery opens up a whole new raft of research possibilities into the psychology of dreaming. Dr Parker explains, My most significant finding is that women in general do experience more nightmares than men. An early study into dreams lead to my discovering that normative research procedures into Dream Research often considered the structure of dreams but that there is a gaping hole in terms of academic study that investigates emotional significance in the analysis of dreams. To discover more about womens dreams I asked participants in my project to fill out a structured dream diary. The evidence was collected in a very different way to that used in previous dream analysis projects that largely depended on recall after the dream has happened. The participants in my study were all primed to record their dreams before the dreams happened. I took a sample of 100 women and 93 men. They were aged between 18 and 25 and were predominantly Year 1 Psychology students at UWE. I found that womens nightmares can be broadly divided into three categories, fearful dreams  being chased or life threatened, losing a loved one or confused dreams. By corroborating dreams with actual life experiences for each participant it became evident that the anxieties about things that have happened in the past can reoccur many times as emblem dreams. Dr Parker continues, It is these emblem dreams that are particularly significant. If women are asked to report the most significant dream they ever had they are more likely than men to report a very disturbing nightmare. Women reported more nightmares and their nightmares were more emotionally intense than mens. We explored the dream reports by whether they were pleasant or unpleasant and this significantly changed findings. Both men and women were more likely to be the victim of aggressive interactions in unpleasant dreams. In pleasant dreams the dreamer was more often the aggressor. Women had more unpleasant dreams than men and unpleasant dreams contained more misfortune, self-negativity and failures. Womens dreams contained more family members, more negative emotion, more indoor settings and less physical aggression than mens dreams. The research discovered that when the natures of these categories were explored more interesting differences in reported behaviour during dreaming emerged. Men made more references to attacks, or serious threat but reported fewer verbally aggressive or covert acts of aggression. Men and womens friendly behaviour in dreams was the same; most often they reported helping other dream characters. Mens dream contained more references to sexual activity. Differences between men and womens sexual behaviour were that men reported more actual intercourse, while women reported more kissing and sexual fantasies about other dream characters. Dr Parker concludes, Each of these dream types has its own distinct subjectivity. It would not have been possible to identify this complexity using traditional approaches to dream investigation. The implication of these findings are far reaching for dream researchers and suggest that we need to think in more complex terms when describing dream report content. 
 Life dissatisfaction may stem from bad sleep Monday, February 9, 2009 NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - People who have a tough time getting a good night's sleep are more likely to become dissatisfied with their lives later on, a new study in twins from Finland shows. While poor sleep and life dissatisfaction each showed a strong tendency to be inherited, they did not seem to share the same genetic roots, Dr. Tiina Paunio of the National Public Health Institute in Helsinki and colleagues found. This suggests, they conclude, that something about sleeping badly in itself may affect "the brain, emotions, and mood." A few studies have looked at the relationship between life dissatisfaction -- which reflects the feeling of well-being and mental functioning -- and sleep quality, the researchers note, but none have looked at how the two are associated over time. To investigate, they surveyed a group of 18,631 same-sex twins in 1975 and again in 1981. In 1975, about 9 percent of the study participants reported dissatisfaction with life, and they were likely to be dissatisfied in 1981. However, their sleep quality did not deteriorate over this period. On the other hand, the people who said they slept "rather poorly or poorly" in 1975 were 2.4 times more likely to be dissatisfied with life in 1981. When the researchers adjusted for all of the factors that could have played a role in the relationship, such as health problems, smoking and drinking habits, and physical activity level, they found that poor sleep independently tripled the likelihood of life dissatisfaction. The findings suggest that bad sleep quality may lead to dissatisfaction with life, but that the reverse is not true, the researchers conclude. "Finding a temporal relation between poor sleep and subsequent life dissatisfaction is likely not to represent solely the dynamic reflections of the same underlying genetic factors," they write. "Rather, it is likely to illustrate more causal mechanisms underlying the neurophysiologic effect of poor sleep on brain function, and the experience of feeling of dissatisfaction in life."

 I know there is a technical term for this, but lately, well, ever since I started Prozac (and now stopped for the last 4 days), I experience this odd dizziness when I wake up in the night (just normal wakeups like bathroom, etc), the dizziness just occurs when I am trying to fall back asleep. This has only occured over the past month and started when I started on Prozac. I take Lunesta for sleep as I have been for the past few years but it hasn't had any side effect like that. Just worries me a little is all. Any info on this? 
 I like many others have an alarm clock to use to wake up. Now that I am off work I don't use it often. My biggest problem with this, is it startles me out of sleep and sometimes into an anxiety attack in the moring. It is almost like in the morning, I can't figure out what the noise. Being half asleep and difficult to pull out of a sleep state gets me into a worried state some times. I have tried rising to classical music, talk radio and other music with no luck. I asked my mom a few times if she would wake me and she screamed my name from my bedroom door. I then asked if she would just rub my foot and call my name quietly, that even that scared me. Does anyone have any ideas on how to wake up at a certian time, but not being jossled out of bed? I saw clocks where it has a light on it that gets slowly brighter and ones with "natural" sounds. Anyone tried these? 
 Childhood sleep terrors inherited, study finds December 1, 2008 Condition causes children to awaken suddenly disoriented and screaming CHICAGO - Night terrors, which send children into sudden inconsolable screaming, are at least partially inherited, according to a study published on Monday. "Our results show that there is a substantial effect of genetics factors in sleep terrors," though no specific genes behind the phenomenon have been identified, Dr. Bich Hong Nguyen of the Sleep Disorders Center at Montreal's Sacre-Coeur Hospital and colleagues reported. In the study of 390 sets of twins, which appeared in the journal Pediatrics, the researchers found identical twins were much more likely to both experience night terrors than fraternal twins. Identical or monozygotic twins have nearly identical genetic makeups, while fraternal or dizygotic twins do not. Twins are often studied because their similar genetic makeup can provide information about diseases and other issues. The researchers said that environmental factors could be part of the cause of night terrors since the twins were being raised together in similar settings. Overall, they found that 37 percent of the twin sets had sleep terrors at 18 months, with the problem disappearing a year later for about half of them. Earlier studies cited in the report have shown genetic factors likely are a factor in some cases of sleepwalking, sleep talking and night terrors. Another study said 19 percent of 4- to 9-year olds experienced night terrors. In contrast to nightmares, "the onset of sleep terrors is abrupt and frightening, usually sudden arousal with screaming," the study said. "During these events children seem confused and disoriented. Any attempt to awaken them may increase their agitation and prolong their episode." However night terrors are brief, cease abruptly and the child usually returns to a deep sleep remembering nothing about the episode, the study said. 
 It's 6:45am here. I've been going to bed between 4am and 8am for almost a month now. A few days ago I stayed up 'round the clock with hopes of being tired enough to sleep at around 8pm the next night but it didn't work. I stayed up through the night anyway. This is probably just a frustrating phase due to a work load a few weeks ago when my husband and I had to stay up two nights in a row printing for a deadline. I've always been a bit of an insomniac but it's gotten better as I've grown older. It still usually takes me between 1 and 3 hours to fall asleep, but usually I can count on sleeping through after I've fallen asleep these days. Unless something goes 'thump' in the night. I used to wake up if someone breathed differently, if a door opened in the house, if the cat walked into the room. Now it takes more to wake me up. I like sleeping, I think I just don't like falling asleep. Willfully giving myself over to unconsiousness. I often feel anxious just as I start to settle down. I do all the classic stuff, worrying about things I might forget, etc., worrying that if I don't sleep NOW I won't get enough sleep, getting angry because I can't sleep, and so on. Sometimes I don't get into that cycle and I still lay awake for hours. Sometimes I just want to avoid having to deal with not being able to sleep, like now, so I just don't go to bed. My husband and I just rode our bikes across the USA, 144 days, and I have never slept better in my life! It was glorious. We would pitch the tent, cook, eat, and SLEEP! We slept through the secondary winds of a tornado(20miles away), and I didn't wake up. I wish I could ride my bike 6 hours a day now. I sleep better when I exercise a lot, but I'm not very disciplined. I used to drink to inebriation and sleep or take three or four times the maximum dose or some over the counter sleeping aid but they usually didn't knock me out anyway. I just felt like crap the next day. There are things I really love about sleeping. I have bizarre dreams, beautiful grand disturbing dreams, almost-but-not-quite nightmare dreams, but I don't remember them as often, and when I don't I miss them. I've even tried taking B supplements because someone told me that they had read a study claiming that B Vitamins enhanced dream recall. Didn't do a thing for me. Anyway, it is 7am, and I am thread jumping because I am new to this forum, and I find it too interesting. Perhaps I am using it as an excuse to stay awake? 
 In the Dreamscape of Nightmares, Clues to Why We Dream at All By NATALIE ANGIER, New York Times October 23, 2007 The patient was a 37-year-old man who had been physically abused as a boy by his schizophrenic mother, often while he lay in bed trying to fall asleep. Nevertheless, he had grown into a reasonably normal, gainfully employed adult, and he thought that the worst was behind him, until one night he awoke to find an intruder rummaging through his dresser drawers. After that, his nightmares began  terrifying, recurrent dreams in which the intruder was a middle-age woman and a knife dangled with Damoclesian contempt from the ceiling fan over his head. The old fear memories had not gone away, said Dr. Ross Levin, a psychologist and sleep researcher at Yeshiva University in New York. They were easily reactivated by the recent trauma, and just as readily twisted into the basis of a repetitive nightmare. Dr. Levin urged the patient to reframe the dream and rehearse alternatives to swinging blades and frozen fear, until finally the nightmares abated and the man could regain his footing. Few of us suffer from nightmares crippling and persistent enough to demand treatment. Yet we all know how bad a nightmare feels, how it surrounds you and surges up to drown you and makes your teeth fall out in chunks and gives you leukemia and look, your 6-year-old daughter is running back and forth through traffic, and oh no, this train is headed the wrong way and its past midnight, and there you are a cowardly third-grader back on Creston Avenue in the Bronx, no, please, not the Bronx! And you scream and you thrash and you want to wake up. By all evidence, outrageously bad dreams are a universal human experience. Sometimes the dreams are scary enough to jolt the slumberer awake, in which case they meet the formal definition of nightmares  bad dreams that wake you up. At other times, they are even worse. The sleeper thinks the nightmare is over, only to step into Your Nested Nightmare, Chapter II. Whatever the particulars of the plot, researchers say, nightmares and dreadful dreams offer potentially telling clues into the larger mystery of why we dream in the first place, how our dreaming and waking lives may intersect and cross-infect each other, and, most baffling of all, how we manage to construct a virtual reality in our skull, a seemingly life-size, multidimensional, sensorily rich nocturnal roundhouse staffed with characters so persuasive you want to ... strangle them, before they can strangle you. A big reason bad dreams offer insight into the architecture of dreams generally is that, as a host of studies have shown, most of our dreams are bad. Whether research subjects keep dream journals at home or sleep in research labs and are periodically awoken out of rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep  the stage most often associated with dreaming  the results are the same: about three-quarters of the emotions described are negative. Moreover, said Robert Stickgold, a sleep researcher at the Harvard Medical School, we are ridiculously industrious dreamers, spending 60 to 70 percent of somnolence dreaming or in a dreamlike state called sleep mentation, which works out to three hours nightly spent in a state of anxiety or frustration as we show up late for tests or walk barefoot over broken glass because our shoes have melted. Even bona fide nightmares are more common than most of us realize. Ask people to recall spontaneously how many nightmares they had in the last year, and they might say one or two, said Mark Blagrove, a dream researcher at the University of Wales in Swansea. Ask them to keep a dream diary, and they will report nightmares once or twice a month. Survey and diary studies have shown that nightmare frequency varies by age and sex. Preschoolers are relatively immune to the bogeyman fetish, but not so their elder siblings. Roughly 25 percent of children ages 5 to 12 report being awakened by bad dreams at least once a week. Nightmare rates climb through adolescence, peak in young adulthood, and then, like so much else in life, begin to drop. The average 55-year-old has one-third the number of nightmares as the average 25-year-old. At nearly every age, girls and women report having significantly more nightmares than do boys and men, a fact that some researchers say may be related to womens comparatively higher rates of anxiety and mood disorders. Nightmare content also shifts over time and across cultures. A young man in 21st-century America might not mind the occasional bawdy dream, but for St. Augustine, the fourth-century Christian philosopher, sexual dreams were nightmares, said Kelly Bulkeley, a dream researcher and visiting scholar at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, Calif. He considered them threats to his faith. Cultural specifics can also tweak universal themes. Dr. Bulkeley and his colleagues have found that nightmares about falling through the air are common among women in Arab nations, perhaps for metaphorical reasons. Theres such a premium in these countries on women remaining chaste, and the dangers of becoming a fallen woman are so intense, he said, that the naturally high baseline of falling dreams is amped up even more. Using brain imaging devices that are noisy and uncomfortable and less than conducive to a good nights sleep, scientists have nonetheless begun identifying which regions of the brain are active during sleep and which are largely off-line. The brain proceeds through four stages of sleep at night, each characterized by its own pattern of brainwaves and neurochemical activity. REM sleep, when the eyes are flitting behind closed lids, is rightly renowned as the dreaming stage, with at least 90 percent of it spent dreaming. But dreams occur in parts of non-REM sleep, as well. When slipping into REM sleep, Dr. Levin said, the whole brain changes. Neurochemically, its like the Fourth of July, as cortical precincts shift colors in scanning images to indicate arousal or quiescence, he said, adding, The limbic system becomes incredibly active, much more so than when youre awake, which is why youre emotionally on edge in dreams. Blazing with particularly patriotic fervor in the limbic system are the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, constituting what Steven H. Woodward, a psychologist at the V.A. hospital in Menlo Park, Calif., terms the brains axis of fear. At the same time, the prefrontal cortex, seat of rational thought and critical reasoning, is on lunch break, Dr. Levin said, which is why you can have a dream where something has 4 heads and 12 legs, and you think, No problem, whats next? Also relatively tranquilized is the primary visual cortex, recipient of visual signals from the outside world. The secondary visual cortex, however, which helps process and interpret those signals, remains alert. It is here that the fabulous imagery of dreams probably arises, said Tore Nielsen of the University of Montreal, as the secondary visual cortex strives to decipher the signals ricocheting through it, many of them internally generated, and to splice them into some approximation of a coherent whole. Other sensory and motor systems remain active in REM, including those that would normally control the arms and legs, which is why motion figures prominently in many dreams. But if you often feel frustrated, as though you can never get to where youre going, well, you cant. As it happens, one vigilant player in dreaming is a small region of the brainstem that paralyzes most of the body, preventing you from physically acting out your dream. People with neurogenerative diseases that disable this brainstem disabler can end up injuring themselves during extreme dream-driven actions. Most cases of sleepwalking occur in non-REM sleep, when the body is not paralyzed. With so much of the sleeping body and brain apparently colluding to allow us to wander safely through an ominous dreamscape of extravagant characters, most sleep scientists are convinced that dreaming serves an essential, possibly evolutionarily adaptive, purpose. In a recent paper in Psychological Bulletin, Dr. Nielsen and Dr. Levin proposed that dreaming served to create what they call fear extinction memories, the brains way of scrambling, detoxifying and finally discarding old fearful memories, the better to move on and make synaptic space for any novel threats that may show up at the door. The brain learns quickly what to be afraid of, Dr. Nielsen said. But if there isnt a check on the process, wed fear things in adulthood we feared in childhood. Ordinary bad dreams rarely recapitulate unpleasant events from real life but instead cannibalize them for props and spare parts, and through that reinvention, Dr. Nielsen explained, the fears are defanged. A bad dream that doesnt lead to awakening is successful in dealing with intense emotion, he said. Its disturbing, but there is some kind of resolution to the extent we dont wake up. By this scenario, nightmares, in allowing you to escape prematurely, represent a failure of the fear extinction system. Bad dreams are functional, nightmares dysfunctional, he said. If you feel yourself falling, spread your arms out and learn how to fly. 
 Getting a Handle on Why We Sleep By Michael Haederle November 25, 2008 New research shows just how harmful insomnia is and how necessary sleep remains. Sleep. It's something everyone likes to do and can't seem to do without. Yet many Americans do with a lot less than they'd like. Suffering from chronic insomnia, they know all too well the deadening fatigue that follows interrup ted sleep. But while the mental misery of sleeplessness is well documented, some eye-opening new reports warn serious health woes may await those who don't get enough shut-eye. Sleep researchers at UCLA have found, for example, that losing even a single night's sleep causes the body's immune system to turn on healthy tissues. That may implicate sleep deficits in cardiovascular disease, some cancers, obesity, arthritis, diabetes and various autoimmune disorders. Heavy snoring was found to be an independent risk factor for carotid atherosclerosis, raising the risk for stroke, according to research done at the University of Sydney in Australia, and a study by Dutch scientists showed that insomnia compromised cognitive processes related to verbal fluency, actually damping down the activity of the brain's prefrontal cortex. Researchers used to regard lost sleep as more of an inconvenience than a health risk, says Dr. Chiara Cirelli, a sleep researcher in the department of psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. "Now we know that sleep restriction for even a week has very profound cognitive effects." It's enough to keep one up at night. More than a third of adults report having had some insomnia symptoms within a given year, according to the American Insomnia Association, and 10 to 15 percent of adults suffer from chronic insomnia. The good news is that nonpharmacological strategies can be effective in battling insomnia. These include cognitive-behavioral therapy, which cuts through the spiraling anxiety that perpetuates sleeplessness, and maintaining good bedtime routines. Scientists still don't know exactly why animals sleep, said Cirelli, whose recent study Is Sleep Essential? was published online by PLoS Biology. She and colleague Giulio Tononi considered the "null hypothesis"  that sleep is not essential. If that assumption, posed earlier this year by UCLA scientist Jerome Siegel, is correct, one would expect to find animals that don't sleep and animals that don't need recovery sleep when sleep-deprived. There also should be no serious consequences to going without sleep. In Do All Animals Sleep? published in Trends in Neuroscience, Siegel cited some creatures that seem to do without sleep, including dolphins, which constantly surface to breathe. But dolphins exhibit "unihemispheric sleep," in which one side of the brain remains active while the other rests. "The existence of unihemispheric sleep is some of the best evidence that sleep is important," Cirelli argued. Cirelli and Tononi also discounted reports that some animals don't seem to need recovery sleep, concluding, "Sleep is present and strictly regulated in all animal species that have been carefully studied so far." Meanwhile, studies have shown that rats and flies die when deprived of sleep. Other creatures  including people  experience brief episodes of microsleep during waking hours as the brain tries to re-regulate itself. Sleep-deprived people often don't know just how badly they're affected even though they are frequently drifting into microsleep, Cirelli said. "They get worse and worse, although subjectively they think they get better," she said. "One second you are perfectly fine, and the next second you are bad. You keep oscillating up and down, up and down." But if sleep is indeed essential, what purpose does it serve? Cirelli and Tononi speculate that it has to do with how learning affects the brain's synapses  the junctures where neurons meet and exchange neurotransmitters. "The function of sleep is a very basic cellular function, which is to maintain synaptic homeostasis," Cirelli said. As we go through our day, absorbing new information, the synapses become stronger, requiring ever-greater energy consumption. But during sleep, neurotransmitter levels drop as the neurons grow quiet and return to their original state. Until recently, sleep research focused on behavior and the fluctuations of brain waves as measured by electroencephalograms (EEG). But now, thanks to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), scientists can get a real-time look at how the brain is affected by sleep deprivation. In Amsterdam, Ellemarije Altena, a doctoral student at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, recruited 21 older Dutch people suffering from chronic insomnia, matching them with 12 controls. The patients, who ranged from age 50 to age 75, had been suffering from insomnia for at least two and a half years. According to a study titled Prefrontal Hypoactivation and Recovery in Insomnia, published recently in the journal Sleep, Altena and her collaborators had subjects perform verbal fluency tests while undergoing fMRI scans. And while the insomniacs did just as well on the tests (in which they might, for example, be asked to think of as many words as possible beginning with a certain letter), the scans showed they had less activity in the left medial prefrontal cortex and the left inferior frontal gyrus, two fluency-specific brain regions. Altena said those regions are involved in verbal "inventiveness," which often declines in patients with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The insomnia sufferers' ability to handle the test may mean that the test wasn't that difficult. Altena also speculates that there might be "some compensatory activation" of another part of the brain, although that might differ from one patient to another. The study was significant because most previous research on sleep deprivation has occurred in laboratory conditions, Altena said. Thanks to fMRI and other new technology, "There's now more focus on natural insomnia." The good news was that the deficits were at least partially reversible with sleep therapy. Patients, who kept a sleep diary, initially had their time in bed limited. As their sleep efficiency increased, they could stay in bed for longer periods. "The motivation for them to be treated for their insomnia was very, very high," Altena explained. Patients were provided with bright lights during the morning and evening to help reset their inner clock. They were also advised to take warm baths a couple of hours before retiring to dissipate heat and normalize their core temperature. Sleep therapy improved the insomnia sufferers' sleep efficiency by 14.5 percent. Moreover, their brain scans showed the affected prefrontal regions were partly restored. "It's very important to investigate these tasks in other age groups and see if these results hold for the other age groups," Altena said. 
 Hello all, Has anyone ever suddenly started to dream all the time? I really should clarify though. In all my time (half a lifetime) I've recalled maybe a dream or two every 2 month's or so if that, good and bad. Then since around last April or so I started dreaming all the time when sleeping, every night and remembering them. If I wake up with broken sleep (nothing new) 3 times a night I will recall 3 separate dreams. A 20 minute catnap on a Sunday same thing. I remember everything and the memories are vivid people and situations from 40 years ago to 1 day ago. These dreams are always different and are not usually nightmares (thank God!), and always happen when I sleep. This has been going on for half a year or more now every night and completely baffles me. Oh I checked the usual suspects , but everything is static around that time frame. No new meds or cessation, no crisis/stress, family, alcohol, drugs, relationships, relocation, job, lifestyle, absolutely nothing. I did have a small weight gain around that time that I've kept for the first time but that's all I can come up with short of mid-life brain damage or changes. I also searched the forum but couldn't find too much except REM and non-REM. It's kind of embarrassing and creepy to me somehow. Anyone have this happen? 
 if you are awoken by a loud voice early in the moring that dosent seem like part of a dream but just like someone calling to wake you in a loud camanding voice. but giving you a message. that is related to the dream. would this be considered a halluanation sorry for bad spelling. 
 Teen sleep: Why is your teen so tired? By Mayo Clinic Staff Aug. 8, 2007 Teens are notorious for staying up late at night and being hard to rouse in the morning. Your teen is probably no exception. But it's not necessarily because he or she is lazy or contrary. This behavior pattern actually has a physical cause. And there are ways to help mesh your teen's sleep schedule with that of the rest of the world. A teen's internal clock Everyone has an internal clock that influences body temperature, sleep cycles, appetite and hormonal changes. The biological and psychological processes that follow the cycle of this 24-hour internal clock are called circadian rhythms. Before adolescence, these circadian rhythms direct most children to naturally fall asleep around 8 or 9 p.m. But puberty changes a teen's internal clock, delaying the time he or she starts feeling sleepy  often until 11 p.m. or later. Staying up late to study or socialize can disrupt a teen's internal clock even more. Too little sleep Most teens need about nine hours of sleep a night to maintain optimal daytime alertness. But few actually get that much sleep regularly. Part-time jobs, homework, school activities and friends often are prioritized higher than is sleep. In fact, more than 25 percent of teens report sleeping only 6 1/2 hours a night or less, according to the National Sleep Foundation. Big deal? Yes. Irritability aside, sleep deprivation can have serious consequences. Daytime sleepiness makes it difficult to concentrate and learn, or even stay awake in class. Too little sleep may contribute to mood swings and behavioral problems. And sleepy teens who get behind the wheel may cause serious  even deadly  accidents. Playing catch-up Catching up on sleep during the weekends seems like a logical solution to teen sleep problems, but it doesn't help much. In fact, sleeping in can confuse your teen's internal clock even more. A forced early bedtime may backfire, too. If your teen goes to bed too early, he or she may only lie awake for hours. Resetting the clock So what can you do? Don't assume that your teen is at the mercy of his or her internal clock. Take action tonight! Adjust the lighting. As bedtime approaches, dim the lights. Turn the lights off during sleep. In the morning, expose your teen to bright light. These simple cues can help signal when it's time to sleep and when it's time to wake up.Stick to a schedule. Tough as it may be, encourage your teen to go to bed and get up at the same time every day  even on weekends. Prioritize extracurricular activities, limit working hours and curb late-night social time as needed.Nix long naps. If your teen is drowsy during the day, a 30-minute nap after school may be refreshing. But too much daytime shut-eye may only make it harder to fall asleep at night.Curb the caffeine. A jolt of caffeine may help your teen stay awake during class, but the effects are fleeting. And too much caffeine can interfere with a good night's sleep.Establish a bedtime routine. Encourage your teen to wind down at night with a warm bath or shower, a book or other relaxing activities  and avoid loud music, video games, phone calls and Internet use in the half-hour before bed. Take the TV out of your teen's room, or keep it off at night. Minimize other noises that might disrupt your teen's sleep, such as TV in other rooms.Go with the flow. Let your teen fall asleep at his or her natural bedtime for a few nights  no matter how late it may be  but insist on a fixed wake-up time. Then move the bedtime back by 10 to 15 minutes each night until you reach a reasonable bedtime. Sleeping pills and other medications generally aren't recommended for teens. Is it something else? In some cases, excessive daytime sleepiness can be a sign of something more than a problem with your teen's internal clock. Other problems can include: Medication side effects. Many medications  including over-the-counter cold and allergy medications and prescription medications to treat depression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  can affect sleep.Depression. Sleeping too much or too little is a common sign of depression.Sleep apnea. When throat muscles fall slack during sleep, they stop air from moving freely through the nose and windpipe. This can interfere with breathing and disrupt sleep.Restless legs syndrome. This condition causes a "creepy" sensation in the legs and an irresistible urge to move the legs, usually shortly after going to bed. The discomfort and movement can interrupt sleep.Narcolepsy. Sudden daytime sleep, usually for only short periods of time, can be a sign of narcolepsy. Narcoleptic episodes occur most often after meals, but can occur at any time  even in the middle of a conversation. Sudden attacks of muscle weakness in response to emotions such as laughter, anger or surprise are possible, too. If you're concerned about your teen's daytime sleepiness or sleep habits, contact your teen's doctor. If your teen is depressed or has a sleep disorder, proper treatment may be the key to a good night's sleep. 
 Human Brain Still Awake, Even During Deep Sleep ScienceDaily Oct. 8, 2008 Sleep in humans is divided in two main phases: non-REM sleep, which occupies most of our early sleep night, and REM sleep, during which our dreams prevail. Non-REM sleep is usually considered as a compensatory resting state for the brain, following the intense waking brain activity. Indeed, previous brain imaging studies showed that the brain was less active during periods of non-REM sleep as compared to periods of wakefulness. Although not rejecting this concept, researchers from the Cyclotron Research Centre of the University of Liège in Belgium and from the Department of Neurology of Liege University Hospital demonstrate that, even during its deepest stages (also called slow-wave-sleep), non-REM sleep should not be viewed as a stage of constant and continuous brain activity decrease, but is also characterized by transient and recurrent activity increases in specific brain areas. In a study published recently in the prestigious American journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the research team led by Dr Thanh Dang-Vu and Pr Pierre Maquet shows that brain activity during these sleep stages is actually profoundly influenced by spontaneous slow rhythms (also called slow oscillations) which organize neuronal functioning during non-REM sleep. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with electroencephalography (EEG), researchers have evidenced that these slow oscillations are associated with brain activity increases during non-REM sleep (see image, side panels), therefore discarding the concept of brain quiescence that prevailed for a long time in the characterization of non-REM sleep. Besides, these activity increases are located in specific brain areas, including the inferior frontal gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the precuneus and the posterior cingulate cortex, as well as the brainstem and cerebellum (see image, central panels). These results improve our understanding of non-REM sleep mechanisms. On the one hand, they demonstrate that non-REM sleep is a stage of brain activation organized by the slow oscillations. On the other hand, they allow the identification of brain areas potentially involved in the generation of these oscillations, which are a hallmark of brain functioning during non-REM sleep. Moreover, by showing the activation of areas involved in the processing of memory traces such as para-hippocampal areas, the study might point to the potential functions of sleep, in particular the increasingly well-defined role of sleep in memory consolidation. Finally, the activation of areas such as the brainstem, usually associated with arousal and waking, might reveal these oscillations of non-REM sleep as micro-wake periods allowing the brain to fulfil crucial and active functions, even during the deepest stages of sleep. 
 Just wanted to check in with everyone. The past 10 days since the hurricane hit has been so hard. Every night I have (and others in my family) horrible nightmares, some about swimming in the storm surge saving already dead people, about trying to hold up our house that fell in, sifting through toys that were destroyed, dreaming that our stuff was in 30 different houses, etc. I can't sleep very well and I wake up feeling like I have been run over by a truck. I am so tired and sad. Everything is overwhelming. 
 Sorry for the grammar. I wanted the title to fit. Ever since I can remember, I've had trouble falling asleep. I do have a history of head trauma, though I'm not if it's actually affected my brain. It's worse than when I was four... It used to be around... Well, I don't remember how long it took me to fall asleep when I was four. But I do know that now, it usually takes four hours, and can take up to six. I don't wet the bed. I've moved and talked a few times while asleep, but I've never really walked or anything like that. I've read a bit, and I've got a hunch that all of my stress is the primary factor in why falling asleep's become so much more difficult. I also think this is the reason why I've been having more intense headaches and headaches more frequently, too... As stated in the thread title, my family won't let me have meds ("It's discipline. You just have to discipline yourself." "Just lie down and close your eyes." "it's because you don't have good sleeping habits! You always start sleeping late!" I think the last quote is really, really, infuriating...), and I can't exactly afford to see any sort of specialist. I know this might sound sad, but... Please help me. :begs: It's a cycle, a terrible, terrible cycle... My parents, they comment every other day on how late I wake up. And then they start going on and on how undisciplined I am and berating me and whatnot. I seem calm about it now, but whenever it happens, it really hurts... I get more stressed out, even if thirty seconds after I have trouble recalling their exact words and what I was thinking just seconds before. More stress... It hurts... I cry after some of thos "incidents," too. And after I cry, I start fealing unbearably lethargic and sleepy... All I want to do is sleep after I cry (and this is both during and after the subsequent headaches). But I can't sleep. I can't sleep during the day... It'll make things worse... 
 I keep trying to go to sleep, but I just can't do it. I keep getting back up. I'm not feeling particularly bad or anything like that. I'm tired, just not sleepy. I'm going to feel this later. LOL. 
 Sleep quality drops with age, but effects diminish Thursday, August 28, 2008 NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Men and women in their 80s and 90s sleep less and have poorer quality sleep than young individuals, but they are also less likely to report feeling unrested or overly sleepy the next day, investigators report in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. "This study is novel in part due to the sheer size and scope of the study compared to earlier works," first author Dr. Mark L. Unruh noted in correspondence with Reuters Health. By studying older individuals still living in the community, the results may be generalized to the majority of older adults. Unruh's group designed the study to determine whether "sleep problems in older adults should be addressed by treating underlying conditions rather than viewed as simply a consequence of aging." The study included 5,407 subjects who completed a sleep questionnaire and underwent a home sleep study. According to Unruh, at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and co-investigators, the sleep test, or "polysomnography," showed that the total average nightly sleep time declined from 386 minutes among women in their 40s to 341 minutes among those 80 years of age or older. In men, the corresponding sleep times declined from 361 minutes to 326 minutes. Older individuals had more nighttime awakenings, the report indicates. The results also showed significant differences between men and women. In men, older age was linked to less deep sleep. By contrast, there was little association between older age and sleep stage in women, but elderly women were more likely to have trouble falling asleep. The investigators note that while older age was associated more strongly with poor sleep - according to the test results -- in men than in women, women were more likely to report having poor sleep. "If older adults have sleep complaints, (doctors) should take them seriously, since older age wasn't strongly associated with complaints of worse sleep," Unruh said. He and his colleagues point out that several treatments have been found to improve sleep in older adults, such as behavioral therapy, biofeedback, management of stress and grief, and use of benzodiazepines (such as Xanax) and melatonin. Any sleep disorders identified should also be directly addressed, Unruh added. "The University of Pittsburgh has an age-wise sleep program that is looking at the contribution of sleep to healthy aging, as well as the contribution of chronic health conditions to sleep in older adults," he noted. "We are also investigating conditions such as sleep apnea that may be strongly related to medical illness." SOURCE: Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, July 2008. 
 Sleep may selectively preserve emotional memories By Anxiety Insights August 29, 2008 A period of slumber helps the brain distinguish core emotions from background details As poets, songwriters and authors have described, our memories range from misty water-colored recollections to vividly detailed images of the times of our lives. Now, a study led by researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and Boston College offers new insights into the specific components of emotional memories, suggesting that sleep plays a key role in determining what we remember - and what we forget. Reported in the August 2008 issue of the journal Psychological Science, the findings show that a period of slumber helps the brain to selectively preserve and enhance those aspects of a memory that are of greatest emotional resonance, while at the same time diminishing the memory's neutral background details. "This tells us that sleep's role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic," says the study's first author Jessica Payne, PhD, a Harvard University research fellow in the Division of Psychiatry at BIDMC. "In order to preserve what it deems most important, the brain makes a tradeoff, strengthening the memory's emotional core and obscuring its neutral background." Previous studies have established the key role that sleep plays in procedural memory, demonstrating that the consolidation of procedural skills (such as typing or playing the piano) is greatly enhanced following a period of sleep. But sleep's importance in the development of episodic memories - in particular, those with emotional resonance- has been less clear. "Emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements - for example, the car that sideswiped us on the ride home - along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion, such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store we'd just passed," explains study author Elizabeth Kensinger, PhD, an Assistant Professor in the College of Arts and Sciences at Boston College. "We were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally, or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others." The authors tested 88 college students. Study participants were shown scenes that depicted either neutral subjects on a neutral background (a car parked on a street in front of shops) or negatively arousing subjects on a neutral background (a badly crashed car parked on a similar street). The participants were then tested separately on their memories of both the central objects in the pictures and the backgrounds in the scenes. In this way, memory could be compared for the emotional aspects of a scene (the crashed car) versus the non-emotional aspects of the scene (the street on which the car had crashed). Subjects were divided into three groups. The first group underwent memory testing after 12 hours spent awake during the daytime; the second group was tested after 12 nighttime hours, including their normal period of nighttime sleep; and the third baseline group was tested 30 minutes after viewing the images, in either the morning or evening. "Our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene [they had seen], with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates," says Payne. But, she adds, among the individuals who were tested after a period of sleep, memory recall for the central negative objects (i.e. the smashed car) was preserved in detail. "After an evening of sleep, the subjects remembered the emotional items [smashed car] as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes," explains Kensinger. "By contrast, sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds [i.e. street scenes] and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake." "This is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional memory become 'unbound' during sleep," adds Payne, explaining that "unbinding" enables the sleeping brain to selectively preserve only that information which it calculates to be most salient and worthy of remembering. A real-world example of this tradeoff, she adds, is the "weapon focus effect" in which crime victims vividly remember an assailant's weapon, but have little memory for other important aspects of the crime scene. Traumatic memories, such as the flashbacks experienced among individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder, can demonstrate similar disparities, with some aspects of an experience seemingly engraved in memory while other details are erased. "Sleep is a smart, sophisticated process," adds Payne. "You might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of." The study was supported, in part, by grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Mental Health. Source: Payne JD, Stickgold R, Swanberg K, Kensinger EA. Sleep Preferentially Enhances Memory for Emotional Components of Scenes. Psychol Sci 2008 Aug;19(8):781-78 [Abstract] 
 On some occassions I have tried to sleep without any medications, on nights when I am extremely tired... but find that the more tired I am, the more anxious I get, and the more anxious I get, the less likely I am to sleep. A doctor called it psycho-physiological insomnia (mind-body), and that is why I am perscribed sleep aids AND benzos in order to sleep. I don't know where this came from but it started in 2003, five years ago, and has gotten worse since. One thing is that my mind races about things I did that day, things I need to do tomorrow, and then dwells on the fact that I NEED to get to sleep for tomorrow's tasks and get anxious about the fact that I won't sleep! It's a ridiculous cycle but it has been plaguing me for years. Heck, tonight, its 11:38pm, I arrived home after a grueling 8 hour drive exhausted at 6pm, took my meds at 9pm, and then suddenly felt the need to do this and that and the other thing....11pm rolls around and I figure I should get to bed, but anxiety increases as I even start walking towards the bed. It was this night that I chose not to take the usual xanax since I'm trying to wene off of it (dangerous drug I find), but resorted to (just a few moments ago) taking another 2mg lunesta and 3mg xanax. I just don't know HOW to sleep, as crazy as that sounds. Just lie there? Do nothing? What are you supposed to think about? Do you force some dream-thinking? Sleep just totally feels unnatural to me... 
 Interrupted Night Sleep Worse for Cognitive Function People almost 4 times groggier than those awakened during day rest, study finds FRIDAY, Aug. 8 (HealthDay News) -- People are groggier and think less clearly when woken up during their night-time sleep than during than an afternoon nap, a new study shows. The findings, published in the August issue of the Journal of Biological Rhythms, have implications for anyone who needs to be alert upon awakening in the middle of the night, such as on-call physicians, emergency personnel and even parents. Researchers found that sleep inertia, the period of grogginess and impaired cognitive performance experienced upon awakening, was nearly four times stronger when people were awoken during the middle of their "biological night" (a period of normal night of sleep) compared to their biological day. The feeling was almost twice as strong during the person's biological morning, the wake-up period following a normal night of sleep. People also showed the least thinking impairment after awakening during the middle of the biological day. "The cognitive impairment during the biological night was twice as large as during the normal time of awakening -- the biological morning," lead author Frank A.J.L. Scheer, a neuroscientist in Brigham and Women's Hospital Division of Sleep Medicine, said in a hospital news release. "This is especially important, considering that already following awakening during the morning, the cognitive impairment can be more detrimental than staying awake all night and has been shown to be comparable to the effects of alcoholic intoxication." 
 It usually takes me an hour to fall asleep, sometimes longer. Sometimes I'm a light sleeper, and wake up at every little noise. Other times, I go into a really deep sleep, and nothing wakes me. (That is how I wet the bed at times.) I just cant understand these sleep patterns. It's just strange to me. 
 Sleep on It: How Snoozing Makes You Smarter By Robert Stickgold and Jeffrey M. Ellenbogen Scientific American Mind August 7, 2008 During slumber, our brain engages in data analysis, from strengthening memories to solving problems In 1865 Friedrich August Kekulé woke up from a strange dream: he imagined a snake forming a circle and biting its own tail. Like many organic chemists of the time, Kekulé had been working feverishly to describe the true chemical structure of benzene, a problem that continually eluded understanding. But Kekulés dream of a snake swallowing its tail, so the story goes, helped him to accurately realize that benzenes structure formed a ring. This insight paved the way for a new understanding of organic chemistry and earned Kekulé a title of nobility in Germany. Although most of us have not been ennobled, there is something undeniably familiar about Kekulés problem-solving method. Whether deciding to go to a particular college, accept a challenging job offer or propose to a future spouse, sleeping on it seems to provide the clarity we need to piece together lifes puzzles. But how does slumber present us with answers? The latest research suggests that while we are peacefully asleep our brain is busily processing the days information. It combs through recently formed memories, stabilizing, copying and filing them, so that they will be more useful the next day. A night of sleep can make memories resistant to interference from other information and allow us to recall them for use more effectively the next morning. And sleep not only strengthens memories, it also lets the brain sift through newly formed memories, possibly even identifying what is worth keeping and selectively maintaining or enhancing these aspects of a memory. When a picture contains both emotional and unemotional elements, sleep can save the important emotional parts and let the less relevant background drift away. It can analyze collections of memories to discover relations among them or identify the gist of a memory while the unnecessary details fadeperhaps even helping us find the meaning in what we have learned. Not Merely Resting If you find this news surprising, you are not alone. Until the mid-1950s, scientists generally assumed that the brain was shut down while we snoozed. Although German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus had evidence in 1885 that sleep protects simple memories from decay, for decades researchers attributed the effect to a passive protection against interference. We forget things, they argued, because all the new information coming in pushes out the existing memories. But because there is nothing coming in while we get shut-eye, we simply do not forget as much. Then, in 1953, the late physiologists Eugene Aserinsky and Nathaniel Kleitman of the University of Chicago discovered the rich variations in brain activity during sleep, and scientists realized they had been missing something important. Aserinsky and Kleitman found that our sleep follows a 90-minute cycle, in and out of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. During REM sleep, our brain wavesthe oscillating electromagnetic signals that result from large-scale brain activitylook similar to those produced while we are awake. And in subsequent decades, the late Mircea Steriade of Laval University in Quebec and other neuroscientists discovered that individual collections of neurons were independently firing in between these REM phases, during periods known as slow-wave sleep, when large populations of brain cells fire synchronously in a steady rhythm of one to four beats each second. So it became clear that the sleeping brain was not merely resting, either in REM sleep or in slow-wave sleep. Sleep was doing something different. Something active. Sleep to Remember The turning point in our understanding of sleep and memory came in 1994 in a groundbreaking study. Neurobiologists Avi Karni, Dov Sagi and their colleagues at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel showed that when volunteers got a night of sleep, they improved at a task that involved rapidly discriminating between objects they sawbut only when they had had normal amounts of REM sleep. When the subjects were deprived of REM sleep, the improvement disappeared. The fact that performance actually rose overnight negated the idea of passive protection. Something had to be happening within the sleeping brain that altered the memories formed the day before. But Karni and Sagi described REM sleep as a permissive stateone that could allow changes to happenrather than a necessary one. They proposed that such unconscious improvements could happen across the day or the night. What was important, they argued, was that improvements could only occur during part of the night, during REM. It was not until one of us (Stickgold) revisited this question in 2000 that it became clear that sleep could, in fact, be necessary for this improvement to occur. Using the same rapid visual discrimination task, we found that only with more than six hours of sleep did peoples performance improve over the 24 hours following the learning session. And REM sleep was not the only important component: slow-wave sleep was equally crucial. In other words, sleepin all its phasesdoes something to improve memory that being awake does not do. To understand how that could be so, it helps to review a few memory basics. When we encode information in our brain, the newly minted memory is actually just beginning a long journey during which it will be stabilized, enhanced and qualitatively altered, until it bears only faint resemblance to its original form. Over the first few hours, a memory can become more stable, resistant to interference from competing memories. But over longer periods, the brain seems to decide what is important to remember and what is notand a detailed memory evolves into something more like a story. In 2006 we demonstrated the powerful ability of sleep to stabilize memories and provided further evidence against the myth that sleep only passively (and, therefore, transiently) protects memories from interference. We reasoned that if sleep merely provides a transient benefit for memory, then memories after sleep should be, once again, susceptible to interference. We first trained people to memorize pairs of words in an A-B pattern (for example, blanket-window) and then allowed some of the volunteers to sleep. Later they all learned pairs in an A-C pattern (blanket-sneaker), which were meant to interfere with their memories of the A-B pairs. As expected, the people who slept could remember more of the A-B pairs than people who had stayed awake could. And when we introduced interfering A-C pairs, it was even more apparent that those who slept had a stronger, more stable memory for the A-B sets. Sleep changed the memory, making it robust and more resistant to interference in the coming day. But sleeps effects on memory are not limited to stabilization. Over just the past few years, a number of studies have demonstrated the sophistication of the memory processing that happens during slumber. In fact, it appears that as we sleep, the brain might even be dissecting our memories and retaining only the most salient details. In one study we created a series of pictures that included either unpleasant or neutral objects on a neutral background and then had people view the pictures one after another. Twelve hours later we tested their memories for the objects and the backgrounds. The results were quite surprising. Whether the subjects had stayed awake or slept, the accuracy of their memories dropped by 10 percent for everything. Everything, that is, except for the memory of the emotionally evocative objects after night of sleep. Instead of deteriorating, memories for the emotional objects actually seemed to improve by a few percent overnight, showing about a 15 percent improvement relative to the deteriorating backgrounds. After a few more nights, one could imagine that little but the emotional objects would be left. We know this culling happens over time with real-life events, but now it appears that sleep may play a crucial role in this evolution of emotional memories. Precisely how the brain strengthens and enhances memories remains largely a mystery, although we can make some educated guesses at the basic mechanism. We know that memories are created by altering the strengths of connections among hundreds, thousands or perhaps even millions of neurons, making certain patterns of activity more likely to recur. These patterns of activity, when reactivated, lead to the recall of a memorywhether that memory is where we left the car keys or a pair of words such as blanket-window. These changes in synaptic strength are thought to arise from a molecular process known as long-term potentiation, which strengthens the connections between pairs of neurons that fire at the same time. Thus, cells that fire together wire together, locking the pattern in place for future recall. During sleep, the brain reactivates patterns of neural activity that it performed during the day, thus strengthening the memories by long-term potentiation. In 1994 neuroscientists Matthew Wilson and Bruce McNaughton, both then at the University of Arizona, showed this effect for the first time using rats fitted with implants that monitored their brain activity. They taught these rats to circle a track to find food, recording neuronal firing patterns from the rodents brains all the while. Cells in the hippocampusa brain structure critical for spatial memorycreated a map of the track, with different place cells firing as the rats traversed each region of the track (see The Matrix in Your Head, by James J. Knierim, Scientific American Mind, June/July 2007). Place cells correspond so closely to exact physical locations that the researchers could monitor the rats progress around the track simply by watching which place cells were firing at any given time. And here is where it gets even more interesting: when Wilson and McNaughton continued to record from these place cells as the rats slept, they saw the cells continuing to fire in the same orderas if the rats were practicing running around the track in their sleep. As this unconscious rehearsing strengthens memory, something more complex is happening as wellthe brain may be selectively rehearsing the more difficult aspects of a task. For instance, Matthew P. Walkers work at Harvard Medical School in 2005 demonstrated that when subjects learned to type complicated sequences such as 4-1-3-2-4 on a keyboard (much like learning a new piano score), sleeping between practice sessions led to faster and more coordinated finger movements. But on more careful examination, he found that people were not simply getting faster overall on this typing task. Instead each subject was getting faster on those particular keystroke sequences at which he or she was worst. The brain accomplishes this improvement, at least in part, by moving the memory for these sequences overnight. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, Walker showed that his subjects used different brain regions to control their typing after they had slept. The next day typing elicited more activity in the right primary motor cortex, medial prefrontal lobe, hippocampus and left cerebellumplaces that would support faster and more precise key-press movementsand less activity in the parietal cortices, left insula, temporal pole and frontopolar region, areas whose suppression indicates reduced conscious and emotional effort. The entire memory got strengthened, but especially the parts that needed it most, and sleep was doing this work by using different parts of the brain than were used while learning the task. Solutions in the Dark These effects of sleep on memory are impressive. Adding to the excitement, recent discoveries show that sleep also facilitates the active analysis of new memories, enabling the brain to solve problems and infer new information. In 2007 one of us (Ellenbogen) showed that the brain learns while we are asleep. The study used a transitive inference task; for example, if Bill is older than Carol and Carol is older than Pierre, the laws of transitivity make it clear that Bill is older than Pierre. Making this inference requires stitching those two fragments of information together. People and animals tend to make these transitive inferences without much conscious thought, and the ability to do so serves as an enormously helpful cognitive skill: we discover new information (Bill is older than Pierre) without ever learning it directly. The inference seems obvious in Bill and Pierres case, but in the experiment, we used abstract colored shapes that have no intuitive relation to one another, making the task more challenging. We taught people so-called premise pairsthey learned to choose, for example, the orange oval over the turquoise one, turquoise over green, green over paisley, and so on. The premise pairs imply a hierarchyif orange is a better choice than turquoise and turquoise is preferred to green, then orange should win over green. But when we tested the subjects on these novel pairings 20 minutes after they learned the premise pairs, they had not yet discovered these hidden relations. They chose green just as often as they chose orange, performing no better than chance. When we tested subjects 12 hours later on the same day, however, they made the correct choice 70 percent of the time. Simply allowing time to pass enabled the brain to calculate and learn these transitive inferences. And people who slept during the 12 hours performed significantly better, linking the most distant pairs (such as orange versus paisley) with 90 percent accuracy. So it seems the brain needs time after we learn information to process it, connecting the dots, so to speakand sleep provides the maximum benefit. In a 2004 study Ullrich Wagner and others in Jan Borns laboratory at the University of Lübeck in Germany elegantly demonstrated just how powerful sleeps processing of memories can be. They taught subjects how to solve a particular type of mathematical problem by using a long and tedious procedure and had them practice it about 100 times. The subjects were then sent away and told to come back 12 hours later, when they were instructed to try it another 200 times. What the researchers had not told their subjects was that there is a much simpler way to solve these problems. The researchers could tell if and when subjects gained insight into this shortcut, because their speed would suddenly increase. Many of the subjects did, in fact, discover the trick during the second session. But when they got a nights worth of sleep between the two sessions, they were more than two and a half times more likely to figure it out59 percent of the subjects who slept found the trick, compared with only 23 percent of those who stayed awake between the sessions. Somehow the sleeping brain was solving this problem, without even knowing that there was a problem to solve. The Need to Sleep As exciting findings such as these come in more and more rapidly, we are becoming sure of one thing: while we sleep, our brain is anything but inactive. It is now clear that sleep can consolidate memories by enhancing and stabilizing them and by finding patterns within studied material even when we do not know that patterns might be there. It is also obvious that skimping on sleep stymies these crucial cognitive processes: some aspects of memory consolidation only happen with more than six hours of sleep. Miss a night, and the days memories might be compromisedan unsettling thought in our fast-paced, sleep-deprived society. But the question remains: Why did we evolve in such a way that certain cognitive functions happen only while we are asleep? Would it not seem to make more sense to have these operations going on in the daytime? Part of the answer might be that the evolutionary pressures for sleep existed long before higher cognitionfunctions such as immune system regulation and efficient energy usage (for instance, hunt in the day and rest at night) are only two of the many reasons it makes sense to sleep on a planet that alternates between light and darkness. And because we already had evolutionary pressure to sleep, the theory goes, the brain evolved to use that time wisely by processing information from the previous day: acquire by day; process by night. Or it might have been the other way around. Memory processing seems to be the only function of sleep that actually requires an organism to truly sleepthat is, to become unaware of its surroundings and stop processing incoming sensory signals. This unconscious cognition appears to demand the same brain resources used for processing incoming signals when awake. The brain, therefore, might have to shut off external inputs to get this job done. In contrast, although other functions such as immune system regulation might be more readily performed when an organism is inactive, there does not seem to be any reason why the organism would need to lose awareness. Thus, it may be these other functions that have been added to take advantage of the sleep that had already evolved for memory. Many other questions remain about our nighttime cognition, however it might have evolved. Exactly how does the brain accomplish this memory processing? What are the chemical or molecular activities that account for these effects? These questions raise a larger issue about memory in general: What makes the brain remember certain pieces of information and forget others? We think the lesson here is that understanding sleep will ultimately help us to better understand memory. The task might seem daunting, but these puzzles are the kind on which scientists thriveand they can be answered. First, we will have to design and carry out more and more experiments, slowly teasing out answers. But equally important, we are going to have to sleep on it.

 So Much to Do, So Little Sleep SUNDAY, June 22 (HealthDay News) -- Most women don't need a survey to tell them a basic fact of female life: They're often sleep-deprived and feel too sluggish to make it through the day with vigor. Whether they're single career women, newlyweds, new moms, single moms, empty-nesters or grandmothers, many -- if not most -- women acknowledge that they just don't get enough shut-eye. In fact, a National Sleep Foundation survey found that 60 percent of the women polled said they only get a good night's sleep a few nights a week -- or less. And 43 percent said daytime sleepiness interferes with their daily activities. But don't abandon hope, say two experts on women and sleep -- there are steps you can take to get back on a well-rested track. For starters, women have to be convinced that lack of sleep is harmful, not a badge of honor. Acknowledging those harmful effects to your health can help you "respect your sleep." "Studies now are showing that if you are sleep-deprived, you have a tendency to gain weight," said Donna Arand, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at Kettering Medical Center in Kettering, Ohio, and a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Sleeping less than seven hours a night is associated with a higher body mass index (a ratio of weight to height) and a higher likelihood of obesity, according to a study of more than 25,000 people published in the journal Sleep. Other researchers looked at the results of 23 studies and found that 17 of them supported an inescapable link between insufficient sleep and increased weight. The findings were published online Jan. 17 in the journal Obesity. But the health risks aren't limited to weight gain. Cardiovascular problems such as high blood pressure have been linked to lack of sleep, Arand said. And the National Sleep Foundation says too little sleep can lead to an increased risk of diabetes, psychiatric problems such as depression and substance abuse, and a greater risk of motor-vehicle accidents. The foundation also says insufficient sleep can hinder attentiveness and make it tougher to remember new information. In fact, performance can be impaired after just four nights of five hours' sleep or less, researchers reported online Feb. 12 in the journal Sleep Medicine. So now that you know why sleep is so important, here's some advice on how to get a good night's rest. First, figure out why you're not sleeping well and then take steps to fix the problem, said Joyce Walsleben, associate professor at the New York University Sleep Disorders Center and a spokeswoman for the National Sleep Foundation. In women, the physical causes of sleep problems are often hormonal, she said. So it's important to take care of the problem -- be it menstrual cramps, hot flashes, or other symptoms. But psychological forces can also play a role. Worry is a big reason why many women don't sleep well. "Women tend to want to solve problems, and they tend to ruminate," Walsleben said. To sleep well, you have to turn off the worry, Walsleben said. One worry-buster that she endorses is mindfulness meditation, an easy-to-learn technique. "Breaking that worry habit is important," she said. Another tool recommended by Walsleben -- writing in a "worry book." Every night, set aside about 15 minutes to jot down your concerns. Use one side of a piece of paper to list everything that worries you. On the other side, write a solution. Both Arand and Walsleben endorse "sleep hygiene habits." According to the National Sleep Foundation, they should include: Exercising regularly. It's best to complete a workout at least a few hours before bedtime, however.Finishing eating at least two to three hours before bedtime.Avoiding caffeine and nicotine close to bedtime.Maintaining a regular bed and wake time schedule, including weekends.Creating a sleep-conducive environment that's dark, quiet, comfortable and cool.Sleeping on a comfortable mattress and pillow.

 For Women, a Happy Marriage Means Sweet Dreams Those in troubled unions report more sleep problems, study finds MONDAY, June 9 (HealthDay News) -- Trouble in your marriage can cause trouble in bed, but not necessarily the kind of trouble that first comes to mind. New research has found that women in happy marriages tend to sleep more soundly than women in unhappy marriages. In fact, women with good marriages have about 10 percent greater odds of getting a decent night of shut-eye compared to women who aren't happy with their spouse. "Marriage can be good for your sleep if it's a happy one. But, being in an unhappy marriage can be a risk factor for sleep disturbance," said the study's lead author, Wendy M. Troxel, a psychologist at the University of Pittsburgh. The million-dollar question, Troxel said, is which comes first -- does the unhappy marriage lead to poor sleep, or does poor sleep contribute to a bad marriage? "We have future studies planned, and we need to tease that out," she said. "If you're not sleeping, you're more irritable, have lower frustration and tolerance levels, so it's possible that could affect the marriage. But we suspect it's in the other direction," that the bad marriage is affecting the quality of sleep because you're trying to sleep next to someone you may be fighting with, and that's stressful. "If you're stressed or anxious, it can have an effect on your sleep," agreed Dr. Ana Krieger, director of the New York University Sleep Disorders Center in New York City. Troxel and her colleagues reviewed data on about 2,000 married women who participated in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). The women were an average age of 46 years. Just over half were white, 20 percent were black, 9 percent were Hispanic, 9 percent were Chinese, and 11 percent were Japanese. All of the women reported their sleep quality, the state of their marriage, how often they had difficulty falling asleep, if they stayed asleep, and how early they woke up. Happily married women had less trouble getting to sleep, had fewer sleep complaints, had more restful sleep and were less likely to wake up early or awaken in the middle of the night than women whose marriages were less than ideal. Even after the researchers adjusted the data to account for other factors known to disturb sleep, the researchers found that happily married women still slept more soundly. And, these findings appeared to hold up across racial lines. The only groups that the findings weren't statistically significant for were Chinese and Japanese women, but Troxel suspects this may be because there weren't as many Chinese or Japanese women in the study as white and black women. Troxel was expected to present her findings June 9 at Associated Professional Sleep Societies annual meeting, in Baltimore. "All marriages aren't created equal, and having a high quality marriage may be good for sleep, whereas an unhealthy marriage is a potent source of stress. You could be sleeping with the object of your hostility," Troxel said. If you have a lot of stress from your marriage or another source, such as your job, Krieger said you need to try to fix the situation that is causing the anxiety. If you can't change the stressful situation, she recommended trying to change how you perceive the stress. Good ways to help you relax are meditation and yoga, she said. Troxel said that if you're in an unhappy marriage, marriage therapy -- or individual therapy if your spouse won't go to therapy -- can be helpful. She also recommended practicing good sleep habits, such as going to bed at the same time and waking up at the same time every day. 
 I had a flying dream last night, but not your usual flying dream. Bumble and I were in space, flying in circles around the Earth, and it was so peaceful and we were holding hands as we were checking the planet to make sure it was happy. 
 Work Conflicts Can Do a Job on Your Sleep THURSDAY, April 17 (HealthDay News) -- Common job-related problems such as conflicts with bosses or co-workers are more likely than long hours, night shifts or job insecurity to cause poor sleep. That's the conclusion of a study by University of Michigan researchers who analyzed data from two surveys of about 2,300 U.S. adults who were followed for up to a decade. During that time, about half of the participants said they had trouble sleeping. "Together, work and sleep take up about two-thirds of every weekday. But until now, very little research has focused on the connections between work and sleep for the average U.S. worker," Sarah Burgard, an assistant professor of sociology and an assistant professor of epidemiology, said in a prepared statement. In their analysis of the survey data, Burgard and graduate student Jennifer Ailshire found that work conditions affected sleep patterns, instead of the other way around. Respondents who frequently felt upset or bothered at work, or had ongoing conflicts with bosses or co-workers, were about 1.7 times more likely than others to experience sleep problems. "Massive changes over the past half-century have reshaped the workplace, with major implications for sleep. For many workers, psychological stress has replaced physical hazards," Burgard said. "Physical strain at work tends to create physical fatigue and leads to restorative sleep, but psychological strain has the opposite effect, making it more difficult for people to sleep." There was no evidence that long hours or working nights or weekends led to poor sleep quality. The researchers did find that work-family conflicts and having children under the age of 3 were significant predictors of sleep problems. People with children under the age of 3 were about 2.2 times more likely to report poor sleep quality. The study was presented April 17 at the annual meeting of the Population Association of America, in New Orleans. Burgard said she plans to examine how to protect workers from negative working conditions and how to prevent work problems from affecting sleep. 
 Nightmare Disorder April 15, 2008 You wake up terrified. Your heart is pounding, you're breathing is shaky, and you feel distraught. Most of us have had this experience - waking up from a nightmare, but what happens when it is a regular occurrence? Nightmare Disorder is another sleeping disorder. While nightmares affect 10-50% of children aged 3-5 years old and 3% of adults report having nightmares frequently, the prevalence of Nightmare Disorder in the United States is not currently known. Individuals who experience Nightmare Disorder awaken from vivid, frightening dreams during naps or at night. They are able to recall the details of their frightening dreams and quickly realize their surroundings upon awakening. Frightening dreams include those that threaten one's security, safety, life, and/or self-esteem. Nightmare Disorder is diagnosed when nightmares affect an individuals social, occupational, academic, or other important parts of one's life. Before Nightmare Disorder is made as a diagnosis, however, mental health professionals rule out other mental illnesses, such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, general medical conditions, and any substance or medication that could be causing the nightmares. 
 The personality of early risers Thursday, August 23, 2007 Morning people, early risers. You know the type; you might even be one. They've already done the housework and gone for a jog while the rest of us are still blissfully cocooned in our beds. According to Juan Francisco Diaz-Morales, such people tend to be of a certain personality: they favour the tangible and concrete, they trust their experience and the observable over intuition and feelings; they have an attention to detail and a preference for logic. They are respectful of authority, care about social conventions and are rarely politically radical. Diaz-Morales gauged the 'morningness' vs. 'eveningness' of 360 undergrads (275 were female) using the Composite Scale of Morningness. It's a 13 item scale that asks participants things like what time they typically get up and go to bed; how alert they feel in the morning; and when they are at the peak of their mental performance. He also measured the students' personality using the Millon Index of Personality Styles, a 180 item test with scales on what motivates people, their thinking style and how they relate to others. Seventeen per cent of the women were classified as morning types, 61.8 per cent as intermediates, and 18.8 per cent as evening types. Among the men, 30.6 per cent were morning types, 50.6 per cent were intermediates and 18.8 per cent were evening folk. In contrast to morning types, evening people preferred the symbolic over the concrete, were creative and risk-taking, and tended to be non-conformist and independent. Diaz-Morales said these findings are a further step towards a more complete and integrated understanding of personality characteristics related to morningness and eveningness dimensions. Source: Diaz-Morales, J.F. (2007). Morning and evening types: Exploring their personality styles. Personality and Individual Differences, 43, 769-778. 
 Insomnia increases depression risk in young adults April 2, 2008 A study published in the journal SLEEP confirms the persistent nature of insomnia and the increased risk of subsequent depression among individuals with insomnia. The study, conducted by Jules Angst, MD, of Zurich University Psychiatric Hospital in Switzerland, focused on 591 young adults, whose psychiatric, physical, and sleep symptoms were assessed with six interviews spanning 20 years. Four duration-based subtypes of insomnia were distinguished: one-month insomnia associated with significant distress, two-to-three-week insomnia, recurrent brief insomnia, and occasional brief insomnia. According to the results, the annual prevalence of one-month insomnia increased gradually over time, with a cumulative prevalence rate of 20 percent and a greater than two-fold risk among women. In 40 percent of subjects, insomnia developed into more chronic forms over time. Insomnia either with or without comorbid depression was highly stable over time. Insomnia lasting two weeks or longer predicted major depressive episodes and major depressive disorder at subsequent interviews. Seventeen to 50 percent of subjects with insomnia lasting two weeks or longer developed a major depressive episode in a later interview. "Pure" insomnia and "pure" depression were not longitudinally related to each other, whereas insomnia comorbid with depression was longitudinally related to both. "We used to think that insomnia was most often just a symptom of depression. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that insomnia is not just a symptom of depression, but that it may actually precede depression. In other words, people who have insomnia but no depression are at increased risk for later developing depression. This study adds to our knowledge by including a much longer follow-up period than most previous studies," said Daniel J. Buysse, MD, of the University of Pittsburgh, lead author of the paper. "We were also able to look separately at insomnia alone, depression alone, and combined insomnia-depression. The results show that insomnia seems to be followed by depression more consistently than the other way around. In addition, we found that insomnia tended to be a chronic problem that gets more persistent over time, whereas depression was a more intermittent problem." Insomnia is a classification of sleep disorders in which a person has trouble falling asleep, staying asleep or waking up too early. It is the most commonly reported sleep disorder. About 30 percent of adults have symptoms of insomnia. It is more common among elderly people and women. It is recommended that adults get between seven and eight hours of nightly sleep. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) offers the following tips on how to get a good night's sleep: Follow a consistent bedtime routine.Establish a relaxing setting at bedtime.Get a full night's sleep every night.Avoid foods or drinks that contain caffeine, as well as any medicine that has a stimulant, prior to bedtime.Do not bring your worries to bed with you.Do not go to bed hungry, but don't eat a big meal before bedtime either.Avoid any rigorous exercise within six hours of your bedtime.Make your bedroom quiet, dark and a little bit cool.Get up at the same time every morning. Those who suspect that they might be suffering from insomnia, or another sleep disorder, are encouraged to consult with their primary care physician or a sleep specialist.

 So scary to the point I'm afraid to go to sleep tonight. It was so real and so very scary. I was trying to find the phone to dial 911 in the dream, but couldn't find it. People were breaking into the house to "get" us. It was awful and way too real. 
 I have dreams about being chased all the time. Running from someone who is trying to kill me. I also have dreams about falling and having car accidents where I go off a bluff. I was abused by my mom as a child, and I began running away from home off and on when I was 11 years old till I was old enough for my mom to let my boyfirend live with us when I was 15 years old. I also fell off of a cliff, about 250-300 feet, when I was 12 or 13 years old. 
 Surviving Daylight Saving Switch Night owls especially need to readjust to cope with loss of hour's sleep on March 9 SUNDAY, March 2 (HealthDay News) -- Planning ahead and following a few simple steps can help you minimize the impact of lost sleep when the clocks go ahead one hour on March 9, says the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The academy offers the following tips to cope with the return to Daylight Saving Time (DST): Begin to readjust your sleep schedule a few days prior to the time change by going to bed an hour earlier.Modify your eating schedule by having dinner one hour earlier.Be careful when driving or operating machinery on the day of the time change.Avoid napping, particularly before bedtime.Keep a light schedule -- such as minimizing driving and avoiding strenuous physical activity -- on the Monday after the time change.Eat properly, stay hydrated and remain physically active. "The conversion to DST, with its forced loss of one hour of sleep and a change in sleep schedule, can sometimes result in complaints of disrupted daytime functioning," Dr. Ron Kramer, medical director of the Colorado Sleep Disorders Center, said in a prepared statement. "This problem, surprisingly, can last as long as one to two weeks in some people, especially in the 'night-owl' type of person." But he added that the change can be a good opportunity to examine your sleep patterns and behaviors. 
 What a nightmare: Americans get too little sleep By Will Dunham Thu Feb 28, 2008 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With late-night TV watching, Internet surfing and other distractions, Americans are getting less and less sleep, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday. And all this sleeplessness can be a nightmare for your mental and physical health, CDC experts cautioned, calling sleep loss an under-recognized public health problem. Sleep experts say chronic sleep loss is associated with obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, cardiovascular disease, depression, cigarette smoking and excessive drinking. The CDC surveyed 19,589 adults in four states. Ten percent reported they did not get enough sleep or rest every single day of the prior month, and 38 percent said they did not get enough in seven or more days in the prior month. The CDC survey was conducted in New York, Hawaii, Delaware and Rhode Island, asking people how many days in the prior month they got insufficient rest or sleep, without asking specifically how many hours they slept. But the CDC released nationwide data collected separately showing that across all age groups, the percentage of adults reporting sleeping six hours or fewer a night increased from 1985 to 2006. The National Sleep Foundation recommends adults get seven to nine hours of sleep a night. Children ages 5 to 12 should get nine to 11 hours and those 11 to 17 need 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 hours. SLEEP IS VITAL "At night, we're doing everything except for sleeping -- we're on the Internet, we may be watching TV. With these new lifestyles we have kind of taken sleep for granted as something that we can do when we have time or we can catch up on it on the weekends," CDC behavioral scientist Lela McKnight-Eily, who led the study, said in a telephone interview. "We don't realize that sleep is a vital part of overall health and that chronic sleep loss is related to both physical and mental health issues," she added. "It's getting worse." Darrel Drobnich, National Sleep Foundation chief executive officer, added that several thousand people die on U.S. roads yearly in accidents involving drowsy drivers. "Americans are definitely sleep deprived. They don't get the amount that even they say that they want," Drobnich said. The CDC said 50 to 70 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep loss and sleep disorders in a country of 300 million. The CDC four-state survey found that younger adults are more likely than older adults to report getting too little sleep. It also found overall that 30 percent of respondents said they got enough sleep every day of the past month, and 33 percent got too little on one to six days in the prior month. Lela McKnight-Eily urged people who often get too little sleep to see a doctor to see whether lifestyle issues are to blame or whether they might have a sleeping disorder. People can also try to establish a regular sleep schedule and avoid caffeine or other stimulants before bedtime, she added. 
 The Rewards of Shut-Eye By Hara Estroff Marano, Psychology Today 25 April 2003 Adequate sleep reduces stress. A midday nap can help deal with information overload. Fact: A midday nap reverses information overloadthose feelings of irritation, frustration and declining performance on mental tasks that set in during intense encounters with new information. Fact: The late stage of sleepsometimes missed by early riserscan boost by 20% your acquisition of coordination crucial for playing a sport, a musical instrument, or any fine motor control. Fact: Sleep strengthens the nerve circuits that underlie learning and memory, allowing the brain to make and consolidate new neural connections. Fact: Missing out on sleep seriously impairs the body's ability to process blood sugar, impeding the action of insulin much as in diabetes. Sleep deprivation may be an important contributor to obesity. It also elevates the stress hormone cortisol. Fact: Sleeping for six hours a night may sound pretty good, but it's not likely enough to keep your immune system happy. Restricting your sleep by a mere two hours a night for one week provokes the process of inflammation, which may set people up for heart disease. Fact: Sleep deprivation curtails your ability to come up with creative solutions to life's challenges. No doubt you know by now that sleep doesn't just put the brain on hold while you lay in bed. Your brain is very active during sleep. Sleep organizes the memories of habits, actions, and skills learned during the day. Sleep gives you the mental energy to master complex tasks and the ability to concentrate. In other words, success comes not only from what you accomplish when you are awake. We also get power from the ability of body and mind to consolidate themselves during the night. Sleep is so important that your brain remembers how much of it you get. And it compensates for sleep loss by allowing you to fall asleep faster and staying asleep longer the next night. Sacrifice sleep and you sacrifice peak performance. It's noticeable in rates of traffic accidents and work injuries. The trouble is, modern life is eating away at your sleep. There's too much to do, and too little time to do it in. So we give up sleep. More and more, we are sleeping less and less, and building up a sleep debt in the process. The trouble is, say experts, society may have changed since the introduction of the light bulb eroded the natural cycles of day and night to which our energy levels are tuned. But our bodies have not. There's no one set amount of sleep that's best for everyone. People vary greatly in their need for sleep. Still, surveys by the National Sleep Foundation report that most adults get less sleep than they need. On average, adults sleep seven hours a night during the workweek. Only 35% of adults sleep eight hours or more per night; 36% sleep 6.5 hours or less. Most people compensate by sleeping longer on weekends, a switch guaranteed to keep your body clock confused. The price we pay for cheating sleep is steep: short-changing the brain of learning potential, short-circuiting your moods, and dimming your alertness, maybe even making you gain weight and compromising your health. Coffee can keep you going for a while. But nothing can compensate for sleep. Your body needs it and your brain needs it. Cornell psychologist James B. Maas, Ph.D., qualifies as one of the nation's leading sleep advocates. In his book Power Sleep (HarperCollins), he implores us to sleep not necessarily more but more efficiently, so we can always perform at our best. Here are his Golden Rules of sleep. Get an adequate amount of sleep every night. Identify the amount of sleep you need to be fully alert all day long and get that amount every night. It will dramatically change your mood and your ability to think critically and creatively. For some people, six hours a night may be adequate. One or two in a hundred can get by on five hours. Many others will need as much as nine or 10 hours. Whatever the amount, most people need 60 to 90 minutes more sleep than they presently get.Establish a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed every night at the same time and wake up without an alarm clock at the same time every morningincluding weekends. Within six weeks the hours you spend in bed will begin to synchronize with the sleepy phase of your biological clock. Your mood will be the winner.Get continuous sleep. For sleep to be rejuvenating you should get your required amount of sleep in one continuous block.Make up for lost sleep as soon as possible, even though you cannot replace lost sleep all at once. And when you sleep longer to catch up, try to do so by going to bed earlier than usual. Otherwise your normal waking time will shift and you're unlikely to get to sleep at the usual time the following night. 
 I just cant sleep.Before I was staying up to 1am and then 2am now 4am,but I do not feel sleepy.I began getting up late nearly at 11 am.Mornings I dont like.After 4pm I feel happiness and do the ironing and cooking,also I can solve math problems easily.I feel happy the way it is,but it is not a normal routine.I tried hard to change my behavior but if I lay on the bed without sleeping it is the worst thing in the world.I just wanted to share my life style. 
 Good night's sleep is no slumber party for smokers Mon Feb 4, 2008 By Will Dunham WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For smokers, getting a good night's sleep is no slumber party, scientists said on Monday. Researchers who tracked the brain activity of smokers while they slept found that they spent less time in deep sleep than nonsmokers. Smokers were also about four times as likely to complain that their sleep did not leave them well rested. The nicotine from cigarettes seems to be a nightmare for sleeping smokers. Because it can act as a stimulant, nicotine makes it harder to fall asleep, the researchers said. And minor withdrawal symptoms that occur as the night drags on can further disturb a smoker's sleep, they added. Researchers led by Dr. Naresh Punjabi of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore set out to learn more about the sleep problems that bedevil many smokers. "Smokers undoubtedly, when you look at the (medical) literature, have sleep-related difficulties. They have difficulty falling asleep and difficulty maintaining sleep," Punjabi said. "The question is why do they have this." A key issue was whether sleep problems could be blamed on the many medical complications brought on by smoking -- symptoms of lung or heart disease, for instance -- or whether smoking itself was the culprit, Punjabi said. The researchers identified a group of 40 middle-aged smokers who had none of the many medical conditions associated with smoking, and compared their sleep patterns to those of an equal number of nonsmokers of the same age and physical type. While sleeping at their homes, they were hooked up to electroencephalogram or EEG machines, which record the brain's electrical activity. Compared to nonsmokers, smokers spent less time in deep sleep and more time in light sleep, the researchers found. The biggest differences took place in the period just after falling asleep, supporting the idea that nicotine's effects are most acute in early stages of sleep, according to the study. In addition, about 23 percent of smokers reported they had not had restful sleep, compared to 5 percent of nonsmokers. The findings were published in the journal Chest, published by the American College of Chest Physicians. "This study provides yet one more reason to stop smoking or to never start," Dr. Alvin Thomas, president of the American College of Chest Physicians, said in a statement. Punjabi said the findings could be important in coming up with better ways to help smokers quit, for instance by tailoring nicotine replacement therapy to minimize withdrawal effects that smokers may experience during sleep." "This is very critical for smoking cessation because one of the major complaints that smokers tend to have when they start quitting is sleep dysfunction," Punjabi said.

 Short-term Medication is Effective Treatment For Insomnia ScienceDaily Jan. 1, 2008 A new study finds that zolpidem extended-release 12.5 mg, taken three to seven nights per week for up to six months, provided sustained and significant improvements in sleep onset and maintenance, and also improved next-day concentration and morning sleepiness in people with insomnia. The study focused on 1,018 patients between 18 and 64 years of age with chronic primary insomnia, who had difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or experiencing non-restorative sleep for three months or greater. The subjects took either a single dose of zolpidem extended-release or a placebo from three to seven nights per week. According to the results, there was a statistically significantly greater benefit in the zolpidem group than in the placebo group on patient global ratings of improvement, with no reduction in clinical efficacy over the course of the study and no evidence of rebound insomnia upon drug discontinuation. At the 12-week end point, 89.7 percent of zolpidem extended-release patients reported that the medication helped them sleep, compared with 51.4 percent of placebo patients. "Approximately 10 percent of the population suffers from chronic insomnia. These individuals are most commonly treated with medications in clinical practice, though for many years we lacked data on the long-term medication management of insomnia," said Andrew D. Krystal, MD, of Duke University, lead author of the study. "However, recent studies document the efficacy and safety of nightly treatment with some insomnia agents for periods of up to one year. As the duration of treatment increases, the costs and risks of adverse effects associated with taking a medication nightly become increasingly important considerations. For the chronic insomnia patients who have waxing and waning symptom severity, it may be possible to decrease the costs and risks by employing non-nightly medication dosing. Consistent with this model, nearly half of insomnia patients take their medications on an 'as needed' basis. Existing studies document the risk-benefit profile of this practice with the insomnia medication zolpidem 10 mg for periods up to three months." Insomnia is a classification of sleep disorders in which a person has trouble falling asleep, staying asleep or waking up too early. These disorders may also be defined by an overall poor quality of sleep. Insomnia is the most commonly reported sleep disorder. About 30 percent of adults have symptoms of insomnia. On average, most adults need seven to eight hours of sleep each night to feel alert and well-rested. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) offers the following tips on how to get a good night's sleep: Follow a consistent bedtime routine.Establish a relaxing setting at bedtime.Get a full night's sleep every night.Avoid foods or drinks that contain caffeine, as well as any medicine that has a stimulant, prior to bedtime.Do not go to bed hungry, but don't eat a big meal before bedtime either.Avoid any rigorous exercise within six hours of your bedtime.Make your bedroom quiet, dark and a little bit cool.Get up at the same time every morning. Those who think they might have insomnia, or another sleep disorder, are urged to consult with their primary care physician or a sleep specialist. The article, entitled Long-Term Efficacy and Safety of Zolpidem Extended-Release 12.5 mg, Administered 3 to 7 Nights Per Week for 24 Weeks, in Patients with Chronic Primary Insomnia: A 6-Month, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, Multicenter Study, was published in the January 1 issue of the journal Sleep. 
 5 things you didn't know about driving while drowsy by JODI MAILANDER FARRELL MiamiHerald.com December 25, 2007 1. Holiday drivers: People often hit the road during the holidays, which also are one of the most sleep-deprived times of the year. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that fatigued drivers contribute to about 100,000 highway crashes, causing 71,000 injuries and 1,500 deaths each year. Like drugs and alcohol, sleepiness contributes to collisions because it slows reaction time, decreases awareness and impairs judgment. 2. Sloppy tired: The consequences of even one to two hours of sleep loss nightly may cause human error and accidents. The potential risks of driving while sleepy are at least as dangerous as the risks of driving under the influence of alcohol, according to the Stanford Sleep Disorders and Research Center. 3. A point for coffee: A study in France recently found that drinking caffeinated coffee is a better option than a short nap for drowsy drivers. The coffee lowered risk for drowsy drivers by 89 percent, while the nap only reduced line crossings by 23 percent. (Researchers noted the best choice is to get off the road entirely and get a full night's sleep.) 4. How to stay awake: Get a good night's rest (seven to nine hours), avoid medications that make you drowsy, avoid drinking alcohol, take regular breaks on long drives (stop every 100 miles or so) and don't drive alone. 5. Ambien alert: Ambien, the nation's bestselling prescription sleeping pill, is showing up with regularity as a factor in traffic arrests, sometimes involving drivers who later say they were sleep-driving and have no memory of taking the wheel after taking the drug. In some state toxicology labs, Ambien makes the top 10 list of drugs found in impaired drivers, according to a report at last year's meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. 
 i am curious to see what is considered a nightmare and what isn't. i always thought that nightmares were terrifying dreams that wake you up. if there is any kind of fear involved does that make a dream a nightmare? or can one distinguish between nightmares and dreams in which you are afraid? 
 Mental Abilities: 'Sleep on It', It Appears, Really Is Good Advice by ERIC NAGOURNEY, New York Times May 1, 2007 Sleeping on the job is not generally a good idea, but when it comes to the brain it may be another matter. As people sleep, a new study suggests, their brains may be sorting through the information they have gathered, making connections that could lead to new insights. The study appears online in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Earlier studies found that people appear better able to remember things they have just learned if they are able to sleep soon after. In effect, they found, the brain appears to use sleep time to consolidate memories. This study suggests that the process is still more complex, and that sleep helps people make inferences from bits of knowledge that may at first appear random, said one of the authors, Dr. Jeffrey M. Ellenbogen of Brigham and Womens Hospital, the Harvard affiliate. People make minor inferences all the time without sleeping first, of course, but those connections tend to be fairly straightforward. Sleep appears to play a role in helping people make big picture realizations, Dr. Ellenbogen said, like those involved in major scientific breakthroughs. Inferences are abundant in the world, he wrote in an e-mail message. Only a few are obvious. The rest need time and sleep to discover them. For the study, researchers asked 56 college students to study pairs of elaborately decorated ovals. They were told that in each pair, one oval won out over the other. But they were not told of a broader pattern in which all the ovals were part of a hierarchy. The students were then broken into three groups. The members of one group were tested to see how much of the hierarchy they could discern just 20 minutes after they studied the shapes. Another group was tested 12 hours later, with half its members having slept. Members of the third group were tested 24 hours later, after all had slept. The first group did the worst, while those students who had been able to sleep did best. 
 OTC sleep aids and supplements: What's best and safe? By Mayo Clinic Staff Dec 8, 2007 You've followed all the tips for getting enough sleep  sleeping on a regular schedule, avoiding caffeine and daytime naps, exercising regularly, and managing stress. Still, a good night's rest remains out of reach. You may be thinking about over-the-counter (OTC) sleep aids or other sleep supplements. If your problem has been bothering you for more than a few weeks, ask your doctor for an evaluation. It's important to know what's causing your insomnia. OTC sleep aids are effective for an occasional sleepless night. But the more often you take them, the less effective they become. And OTC sleep aids may leave you feeling groggy and unwell the next day, particularly if you're an older adult. If you're considering sleeping supplements, it's important to understand that much is unknown about their safety and effectiveness. Common OTC sleep aids Various OTC sleep aids are available in any pharmacy. Most of these medications contain antihistamines, which induce drowsiness by working against the central nervous system chemical histamine. Talk to your doctor before taking any OTC sleep aid if you're currently taking a prescription monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) or did so as recently as two weeks ago. Also check with your doctor first if you take any drugs for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions, or Parkinson's disease. Diphenhydramine (Sominex, Nytol) These may cause: Dry mouthDizzinessProlonged drowsiness lasting into the next day They are not recommended if you're breast-feeding. They also may not be safe if you're pregnant or have a history of: GlaucomaHeart problemsEnlarged prostate Doxylamine (Unisom) This may cause prolonged drowsiness. It also may not be safe if you're pregnant or breast-feeding or you have a history of: AsthmaBronchitisGlaucomaPeptic ulcerEnlarged prostate With either type of OTC sleeping aid, don't drive or attempt other activities that require alertness while taking the drug. Dietary supplements Various dietary supplements have been touted as effective insomnia treatments, but there's much that isn't known about their effectiveness or safety. The most widely publicized may be the hormone melatonin and the herb valerian. Melatonin Melatonin is thought to help control your body's internal clock. The melatonin supplements most often found in health food stores and pharmacies are synthetic versions of the natural hormone. These supplements are most helpful for people experiencing jet lag or the effects of shift work. They have less and inconsistent effects as a sleep aid. There are many unanswered questions about melatonin. Some people who've taken melatonin have reported: Daytime drowsinessHeadachesDizziness Other side effects reported include stomach discomfort, short-lasting depression symptoms, mild tremor, mild anxiety, irritability and confusion. Melatonin may interact with a variety of common drugs, so talk with your doctor before trying it. The optimal dose isn't certain, and the long-term effects are unknown. Melatonin may not be safe if you're: PregnantBreast-feedingYounger than age 20 Valerian Supplements made from this plant may reduce the amount of time it takes to fall asleep and help you sleep better. However, it's not clear what the active ingredient is, and the potencies of various ingredients vary from preparation to preparation. Not all studies have shown the compound to be effective, and there may be some dangers. Side effects may include: HeadacheExcitability or uneasinessHeart disturbances Valerian may not be safe if you're pregnant or breast-feeding. Valerian may strongly react with other sleep aids and with alcohol, and may react with other medications, as well. The optimal dose isn't certain, and the long-term effects are unknown. Talk to your doctor before taking valerian. Taking sleeping pills If your best attempts to get a good night's sleep have failed, your best bet is to seek evaluation by your doctor. Often, specific causes for insomnia may be found that are reversible. Nondrug approaches including cognitive behavior therapies can be effective. Prescription sleeping pills may be both effective and safe, if taken as prescribed. Consider OTC sleep aids or supplements with caution. Start with your doctor. You don't need your doctor's OK to take an over-the-counter sleep aid, but it's a good idea to check with your doctor anyway. He or she can make sure the sleep aid won't interact with other medications or medical conditions. Your doctor can also help you determine the best dosage. In some cases, your doctor may recommend prescription sleeping pills. If you and your doctor decide further evaluation is needed, you may be referred to a sleep specialist.Take it one day at a time. Sleep aids are a temporary solution for insomnia. Most over-the-counter varieties are intended to be used for only two to three nights at a time. Taken too often, some sleep aids may cause rebound insomnia  sleeplessness that returns in full force when you stop taking the medication.Avoid alcohol. Never mix alcohol and sleep aids. Alcohol increases the sedative effects of the pills. Even a small amount of alcohol combined with sleep aids can make you feel dizzy, confused or faint.Quit carefully. When you're ready to stop taking sleep aids, follow your doctor's instructions or the directions on the label. Some medications must be stopped gradually.Watch for side effects. If you feel sleepy or dizzy during the day, talk to your doctor about changing the dosage or discontinuing the pills.Everyone deserves a good night's sleep. If you continue to have trouble sleeping, consult your doctor for additional help. 
 Bedtime battles? Put childhood bedtime problems to rest By Mayo Clinic Staff Oct 4, 2007 Want your child to go to bed without a fuss  and stay there? Start with a predictable, calming bedtime routine. You're past middle-of-the-night feedings and diaper changes, but a good night's sleep is still elusive. Maybe bedtime has turned into a battle of wills, or you're struggling to get your child to stay in his or her bed all night. Worse yet, these bedtime battles may be leaving your child tired and cranky during the day. Consider these simple strategies to put the most common bedtime problems to rest  starting tonight! The problem: Bedtime is chaotic. The scenario: Your days and nights are booked. You often feel rushed when you put your child to bed. The solution: Even if you need to rearrange your schedule, it's important to make bedtime a priority. A predictable, calming bedtime routine is often the key to a good night's sleep. What's in the bedtime routine is up to you. You might give your child a warm bath, brush his or her teeth, read a few stories and say prayers. Each night, you might praise your child for a specific accomplishment or describe something that makes you proud of your child. If you play bedtime music, play the same songs every night. Then tuck your child snugly into bed and say good night. Experiment to find what works best for you  but once you settle on a routine, follow the same sequence of events at the same time and in the same order every night. The problem: Your child doesn't want to go to bed. The scenario: It's bedtime, but your child fusses about going to sleep because he or she doesn't want to miss anything. The solution: If your child can hear talking, laughing, or sounds from the computer or TV, it's easy to see how he or she would feel left out. To ease the transition to bedtime, keep things quiet during the last hour before bedtime. Put away noisy games and toys. Turn off the TV, computer and video games. Dim the lights. Limit the entire family to quiet activities, such as reading books or doing puzzles. Sleep may be more appealing if everyone slows down before bedtime. The problem: Your child won't fall asleep alone. The scenario: Your child begs you to stay in the room until he or she falls asleep. The solution: To encourage your child to fall asleep alone, help him or her feel secure. Start with a calming bedtime routine. Then make sure your child has a favorite comfort object, such as a stuffed animal or blanket, for company. If your child is afraid of the dark, turn on a night light or leave the bedroom door open. If your child continues to resist, you might promise to check on your child every 10 minutes until he or she falls asleep. During these checkups, praise your child for being so quiet and staying in bed. Remember that you're helping your child learn to fall asleep alone. If you give in and climb into bed with your child, that's what your child will remember  and probably expect the next night. The problem: Your child won't stay in his or her bed. The scenario: You put your child to bed, only to find him or her trailing you down the hall. The solution: Don't let bedtime become a power struggle. When your child's bedtime routine is complete and he or she is comfortable, remind your child that there's no reason to get out of bed. If your child gets up, promptly return him or her to bed  repeatedly, if necessary. You may have to shut the door or put up a gate or barrier. If your child tends to wander around the house after you've gone to bed, you might use a bell or alarm on the door. The problem: Your child stays up too late. The scenario: Your child's bedtime is 8:30 p.m., but by the time he or she is ready for bed it's usually past your bedtime. The solution: If your child isn't tired at bedtime, you may be fighting a losing battle. Try scaling back daytime naps or rousing your child earlier in the morning. You can also put your child to bed 10 to 15 minutes earlier every night until you're back to the original bedtime. Whatever time you put your child to bed, remember to stick to a calming bedtime routine. Taking time to wind down might help your child fall asleep. The problem: Your child wakes up during the night. The scenario: Your child wakes up during the night and won't fall asleep again without your help. The solution: If your child wakes up during the night, give him or her a few minutes to settle down. If time alone doesn't do the trick, go to your child's room and offer calm reassurance. Then tell your child that it's time to sleep and leave the room. Wait longer each night to go to your child's side, until eventually your child falls back to sleep without your help. As an alternative, you might reassure your child and then doze in a chair or on a cot in your child's room until he or she falls asleep. Each night, move the chair or cot closer to the door  until finally you're out of the room. If your child is keyed up when he or she wakes in the middle of the night, you might offer a flashlight and a book or other quiet items. Keep the items close to your child's bed. Encourage your child to use the items until he or she is ready to fall asleep again. The problem: You're frustrated with your child's bedtime problems. The scenario: You're tired of the whining, crying and complaining, so you give up and let your child fall asleep in front of the TV. The solution: Bedtime battles can test a parent's resolve. But don't give up. You may need to be patient  and ignore whines, cries and pleas  but it's never too late to teach your child good sleeping habits. If your child is pushing the limits, state your expectations and stick to the routine. Eventually, your consistency will pay off in a good night's sleep for everyone. 
 In the Dreamscape of Nightmares, Clues to Why We Dream at All By NATALIE ANGIER, New York Times October 23, 2007 The patient was a 37-year-old man who had been physically abused as a boy by his schizophrenic mother, often while he lay in bed trying to fall asleep. Nevertheless, he had grown into a reasonably normal, gainfully employed adult, and he thought that the worst was behind him, until one night he awoke to find an intruder rummaging through his dresser drawers. After that, his nightmares began  terrifying, recurrent dreams in which the intruder was a middle-age woman and a knife dangled with Damoclesian contempt from the ceiling fan over his head. The old fear memories had not gone away, said Dr. Ross Levin, a psychologist and sleep researcher at Yeshiva University in New York. They were easily reactivated by the recent trauma, and just as readily twisted into the basis of a repetitive nightmare. Dr. Levin urged the patient to reframe the dream and rehearse alternatives to swinging blades and frozen fear, until finally the nightmares abated and the man could regain his footing. Few of us suffer from nightmares crippling and persistent enough to demand treatment. Yet we all know how bad a nightmare feels, how it surrounds you and surges up to drown you and makes your teeth fall out in chunks and gives you leukemia and look, your 6-year-old daughter is running back and forth through traffic, and oh no, this train is headed the wrong way and its past midnight, and there you are a cowardly third-grader back on Creston Avenue in the Bronx, no, please, not the Bronx! And you scream and you thrash and you want to wake up. By all evidence, outrageously bad dreams are a universal human experience. Sometimes the dreams are scary enough to jolt the slumberer awake, in which case they meet the formal definition of nightmares  bad dreams that wake you up. At other times, they are even worse. The sleeper thinks the nightmare is over, only to step into Your Nested Nightmare, Chapter II. Whatever the particulars of the plot, researchers say, nightmares and dreadful dreams offer potentially telling clues into the larger mystery of why we dream in the first place, how our dreaming and waking lives may intersect and cross-infect each other, and, most baffling of all, how we manage to construct a virtual reality in our skull, a seemingly life-size, multidimensional, sensorily rich nocturnal roundhouse staffed with characters so persuasive you want to ... strangle them, before they can strangle you. A big reason bad dreams offer insight into the architecture of dreams generally is that, as a host of studies have shown, most of our dreams are bad. Whether research subjects keep dream journals at home or sleep in research labs and are periodically awoken out of rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep  the stage most often associated with dreaming  the results are the same: about three-quarters of the emotions described are negative. Moreover, said Robert Stickgold, a sleep researcher at the Harvard Medical School, we are ridiculously industrious dreamers, spending 60 to 70 percent of somnolence dreaming or in a dreamlike state called sleep mentation, which works out to three hours nightly spent in a state of anxiety or frustration as we show up late for tests or walk barefoot over broken glass because our shoes have melted. Even bona fide nightmares are more common than most of us realize. Ask people to recall spontaneously how many nightmares they had in the last year, and they might say one or two, said Mark Blagrove, a dream researcher at the University of Wales in Swansea. Ask them to keep a dream diary, and they will report nightmares once or twice a month. Survey and diary studies have shown that nightmare frequency varies by age and sex. Preschoolers are relatively immune to the bogeyman fetish, but not so their elder siblings. Roughly 25 percent of children ages 5 to 12 report being awakened by bad dreams at least once a week. Nightmare rates climb through adolescence, peak in young adulthood, and then, like so much else in life, begin to drop. The average 55-year-old has one-third the number of nightmares as the average 25-year-old. At nearly every age, girls and women report having significantly more nightmares than do boys and men, a fact that some researchers say may be related to womens comparatively higher rates of anxiety and mood disorders. Nightmare content also shifts over time and across cultures. A young man in 21st-century America might not mind the occasional bawdy dream, but for St. Augustine, the fourth-century Christian philosopher, sexual dreams were nightmares, said Kelly Bulkeley, a dream researcher and visiting scholar at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, Calif. He considered them threats to his faith. Cultural specifics can also tweak universal themes. Dr. Bulkeley and his colleagues have found that nightmares about falling through the air are common among women in Arab nations, perhaps for metaphorical reasons. Theres such a premium in these countries on women remaining chaste, and the dangers of becoming a fallen woman are so intense, he said, that the naturally high baseline of falling dreams is amped up even more. Using brain imaging devices that are noisy and uncomfortable and less than conducive to a good nights sleep, scientists have nonetheless begun identifying which regions of the brain are active during sleep and which are largely off-line. The brain proceeds through four stages of sleep at night, each characterized by its own pattern of brainwaves and neurochemical activity. REM sleep, when the eyes are flitting behind closed lids, is rightly renowned as the dreaming stage, with at least 90 percent of it spent dreaming. But dreams occur in parts of non-REM sleep, as well. When slipping into REM sleep, Dr. Levin said, the whole brain changes. Neurochemically, its like the Fourth of July, as cortical precincts shift colors in scanning images to indicate arousal or quiescence, he said, adding, The limbic system becomes incredibly active, much more so than when youre awake, which is why youre emotionally on edge in dreams. Blazing with particularly patriotic fervor in the limbic system are the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, constituting what Steven H. Woodward, a psychologist at the V.A. hospital in Menlo Park, Calif., terms the brains axis of fear. At the same time, the prefrontal cortex, seat of rational thought and critical reasoning, is on lunch break, Dr. Levin said, which is why you can have a dream where something has 4 heads and 12 legs, and you think, No problem, whats next? Also relatively tranquilized is the primary visual cortex, recipient of visual signals from the outside world. The secondary visual cortex, however, which helps process and interpret those signals, remains alert. It is here that the fabulous imagery of dreams probably arises, said Tore Nielsen of the University of Montreal, as the secondary visual cortex strives to decipher the signals ricocheting through it, many of them internally generated, and to splice them into some approximation of a coherent whole. Other sensory and motor systems remain active in REM, including those that would normally control the arms and legs, which is why motion figures prominently in many dreams. But if you often feel frustrated, as though you can never get to where youre going, well, you cant. As it happens, one vigilant player in dreaming is a small region of the brainstem that paralyzes most of the body, preventing you from physically acting out your dream. People with neurogenerative diseases that disable this brainstem disabler can end up injuring themselves during extreme dream-driven actions. Most cases of sleepwalking occur in non-REM sleep, when the body is not paralyzed. With so much of the sleeping body and brain apparently colluding to allow us to wander safely through an ominous dreamscape of extravagant characters, most sleep scientists are convinced that dreaming serves an essential, possibly evolutionarily adaptive, purpose. In a recent paper in Psychological Bulletin, Dr. Nielsen and Dr. Levin proposed that dreaming served to create what they call fear extinction memories, the brains way of scrambling, detoxifying and finally discarding old fearful memories, the better to move on and make synaptic space for any novel threats that may show up at the door. The brain learns quickly what to be afraid of, Dr. Nielsen said. But if there isnt a check on the process, wed fear things in adulthood we feared in childhood. Ordinary bad dreams rarely recapitulate unpleasant events from real life but instead cannibalize them for props and spare parts, and through that reinvention, Dr. Nielsen explained, the fears are defanged. A bad dream that doesnt lead to awakening is successful in dealing with intense emotion, he said. Its disturbing, but there is some kind of resolution to the extent we dont wake up. By this scenario, nightmares, in allowing you to escape prematurely, represent a failure of the fear extinction system. Bad dreams are functional, nightmares dysfunctional, he said. If you feel yourself falling, spread your arms out and learn how to fly. 
 The Night Visitor By LYNN LOVE, New York Times June 10, 2007 AT 2 a.m. the reedy doorbell of my Upper East Side apartment sounded twice. As I woke up, my first thought was fire, but I could smell no smoke. There were no ladder trucks parked outside my walk-up, as there had been several months earlier when one of my neighbors  a jet-lagged flight attendant  fell asleep while roasting a chicken. By midnight her stove was in flames. On the contrary, it was supernaturally quiet on my block on this spring night about a year ago. I was alone with my 7-year-old daughter, who was asleep. My husband was traveling on business and would not be home until the next day. The doorbell rang again, this time in three quick bursts. Alarmed, I padded to my front door in my pajamas. Through the peephole I saw a clean-cut man I did not recognize, wearing a plain gray T-shirt. Was he a resident of the building, or maybe a stranger who had sneaked through the locked front doors downstairs with a group of legitimate late-night arrivals? I didnt know. I peered at him for a few moments as he looked anxiously from side to side. He looked like a hybrid of the Friends actor Matt LeBlanc and the baby-faced British rocker Pete Doherty. My building, a turn-of-the-century tenement, sits rubbing rooftops with two others like it on a calm block in the East 60s. Not having a doorman like those in the upscale high-rises that surround us forces us to rely on one another  a little. In the three years I had lived there, Id learned that Charlie the old-timer in No. 12 will receive your U.P.S. or FedEx packages if you leave him a note. Mrs. Wang, the building manager, will let you in if you forget your key. The snow shovel and salt for the front stoop are under the first-floor staircase for any of us younger residents to use. But like the inhabitants of most New York buildings, we share walls, monthly payments, passing hellos and not much more. The stranger at my door was a problem. He could have no business with me, but he was insistent. I considered retreating back to bed, ignoring him. Instead, when he jabbed the doorbell yet again, a combination of annoyance and curiosity took hold. Who are you? I asked through the door. Steve, he said gruffly. Who is Steve? I asked. Your neighbor, he said. He wasnt looking into the tiny lens through which I was staring at him. He seemed distracted. What can I do for you, neighbor Steve? I asked. I cant get inside my place; my wife, Katrina, is there, he said, enigmatically. I was puzzled. Had he come home late and forgotten his key? If so, why no coat in such chilly weather? Or had his wife locked him out on purpose? He didnt look drunk or stoned, or agitated. If anything, he seemed passive. I scrutinized him again, my mind groping for an explanation. Where do you live? I asked. No. 19, he replied without hesitation, nodding at the apartment next to mine. Nineteen was in that spot, but one floor up. I realized Id be taking a risk, but I had the impulse to size him up by seeing something beyond the distorted talking head and shoulders. I yanked my door open, leaving the chain attached. Below the T-shirt, which was tucked neatly into navy boxers, I was surprised to see Steves bare legs and feet. A laugh formed in my head, but I squelched it. At 2 a.m., an unexplained man in the hallway wearing underwear is not reassuring. Steve took a step away and turned to face the entrance to my next-door neighbors two-bedroom  No. 19. I asked if he knew them. He didnt answer. A creepy silence saturated the hallway. Do you want me to call Katrina? I asked. He nodded. I closed my door and dead-bolted it, alone again, yet conscious of the cryptic presence on the other side. What is with this guy, I wondered as Steve began reciting digits through the door. What is with me, I wondered as I dialed them. I pressed the receiver to my ear as the ringing began. I didnt want to get more involved with whatever circumstances had displaced him, so I reopened my door a crack and slipped the phone to him through the narrow opening. I wouldnt have cared if he had run off with it, so relieved did I suddenly feel to be witnessing this conversation rather than participating in it. I watched him as he described to Katrina, or someone, that he was stranded outside his apartment. Now he was making direct eye contact with me, his face knotting into distress and confusion. He told the person he was speaking to that he was in front of No. 16, verifying it by squinting and leaning toward my door. I dont know, he said into the mouthpiece a few times. O.K. I will, I will. Watching his expression change, I realized I had observed this kind of behavior before. During bouts of sleepwalking when we were children, my younger brother used to get stuck in the hallways of our big Victorian home in upstate New York like a malfunctioning robot. If he spoke, his halting speech would make only partial sense. The times I woke him and gently urged him back to bed, his face contained the same anguish I saw wash over Steves. Im so sorry, he said, handing the phone back, his voice barely above a whisper. This isnt the first time this has happened. Then he turned and took the stairs two at a time to the fifth floor. My brother rarely remembered his sleep wanderings and conversations afterward. He would blush in embarrassment if I re-enacted them. But he was only a little boy at the time. Would Steve remember, I wondered. Would we ever meet inside our building and acknowledge our strange encounter? Still stunned by my distant recognition of the somnambulist state, I held my door open a few seconds longer. I heard the creak of hinges turning upstairs. Steve had returned home, or found one for the night. 
 Behavioral Therapies for the Treatment of Insomnia October 15, 2007 by Milton K. Erman, MD Psychiatry Weekly, Volume 2, Issue 39 Insomnia can be a symptomatic complaint or a disorder. When insomnia presents as an uncomplicated symptomatic complaint, ie, transient insomnia associated with travel or stress, the use of a hypnotic medication as a solo therapy may not only be appropriate, but advisable. However, when patients suffer from the disorder of insomnia, it is a gross disservice for clinicians to simply provide a medication with no effort made to help patients change perceptions and behaviors that will otherwise play a role in promoting a persistent insomnia condition. Stimulus Control Most physicians are familiar with the elements of stimulus control. The aim of stimulus-control therapy is to break the negative associations of being in bed unable to sleep. It is especially helpful for patients with sleep-onset insomnia and prolonged awakenings. This approach utilizes specific techniques such as not remaining in bed if unable to sleep, avoiding naps, and getting up from bed if one is unable to sleep. It can be very effective as a treatment approach, although it does not incorporate any efforts at changing cognitive perceptions with regard to insomnia and sleep needs. Sleep Restriction Another strictly behavioral approach is sleep restriction. In this approach, patients completed questionnaires to determine the amount of sleep that they report obtaining per night on a regular basis. They are then restricted to this amount of sleep and asked to stay up to a late bedtime hour in order to obtain this amount of sleep in a single consolidated period of sleep. For example, a patient who reports sleeping only 5 hours per night may be asked to stay up until 2:15 AM, and then allowed to sleep until 7:15 AM. If the patient has demonstrated success at obtaining these 5 hours of sleep per night on a regular basis, the amount of time that they are allowed to spend in bed is increased. Patients must first agree to a model of treatment that may not conform to their perception of how sleeplessness affects them, ie, that no matter how little sleep they obtain on a given night, they will not sleep the next night. If their sleep deprivation does cause them to feel sleepy, they must still restrict their sleep to their allowed nighttime hours. They are not allowed to take naps in the daytime, or to sleep in. Progressive Muscular Relaxation Various types of relaxation therapies have been utilized in the treatment of insomnia, although few have been formally tested. Simple approaches such as progressive musuclar relaxation may be helpful for patients as part of a regimen intended to reduce arousal immediately before bedtime and can generally be taught to patients with the aid of relaxation tapes or compact discs. Other relaxation techniques that may be beneficial to some individuals include self-hypnosis, yoga, meditation, and focused imagery. Conclusion If generalizations can be made about treatment of insomnia, they are that no patients should be given the message that a medication alone is the solution to their insomnia problem. A clinicians goal with all patients should be to emphasize the role that cognitive and behavioral strategies may play in promoting better sleep habits and sleep hygiene, whether or not medications are utilized. Ideally, patients will be able to reduce their reliance on the use of medications over time, relying on them on an as needed basis, but utilizing cognitive and behavioral techniques to promote good sleep and prevent a recurrence of insomnia symptoms. 
 Sleep After Hard Workouts? You Must Be Dreaming By GINA KOLATA, New York Times September 13, 2007 WHEN Jennifer Davis, my partner for long runs, was in college about 15 years ago, she had a real problem staying awake in her classes. The reason, she said, were those long, grueling workouts with the Dartmouth crew early in the day. Those are the only memories I have of totally falling asleep in lectures, said Ms. Davis, a physical chemist living in Montgomery, N.J. My notes from biology consist largely of squiggly lines meandering down the page of my notebook. Its one of the mysteries of sleep: Why is it that mild exercise can be invigorating, but strenuous endurance exercise  whether its crew practice, long runs as training for a marathon or juggling back-to-back workouts to prepare for a triathlon  makes people groggy? Elite marathoners know that hunger for sleep all too well. Deena Kastor, who won the London Marathon last year and set an American record, said she sleeps 10 hours at night and takes a two-hour nap every afternoon. Steven Spence, a marathoner who won a bronze medal at the 1991 world championships in Tokyo, had the same sleep habits when he was training. I would be sleeping about half of my life, Mr. Spence said. Researchers say the science behind that sleepiness is poorly understood. Most studies ask other questions, like how sleep affects memory and thinking abilities, and suggest, for example, that it may help people consolidate memories. Of course, no one ever thought they had to sleep for 12 hours because they were studying so hard. There are no studies of large groups of endurance athletes, asking whether they needed more sleep and, if so, why, said Dr. Alex Chediak, president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and chief of the Sleep Disorders Center at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. In fact, he said, to his knowledge, there is not even a study where a long distance runner was allowed to do his or her thing and then studied for sleep before and sleep after. Most sleep studies are more practical, Dr. Chediak explained, with a goal of helping people in the general population. Runners are more of a curiosity, he said. And because intense endurance exercise isnt what most exercisers do, it is not even feasible to reason by inference. For example, sleep specialists often tell people with insomnia to exercise five to six hours before bedtime. The mild exercise raises the bodys core temperature. When the temperature falls again a few hours later, that signals the body to sleep. But that is a different sort of exercise from what endurance athletes do, and so what happens to marathoners-in-training must have another explanation. One possibility, Dr. Chediak said, is that cytokines  hormones that signal the immune system  are making these athletes sleep so much. Exercise, Dr. Chediak said, prompts muscles to release two cytokines, interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, that make people drowsy and prolong the time they remain sleeping. In fact, those cytokines also are released when people have a cold or infection, which is why people sleep so much when they are ill. It turns out that the single most important factor for increasing the release of those two cytokines is increasing the duration and intensity of exercise, Dr. Chediak said. And, he noted, thats what is happening when endurance athletes train. A sprint will not get you as great an effect, he said. On the other hand, he cautioned, the cytokine hypothesis is based on extrapolations from other data and animal studies. But spending half their lives slumbering is only part of the sleep equation for athletes. They also have the opposite problem: they have trouble falling asleep the night before a big race. Its not clear whether a sleepless night before a race affects athletic performance, Dr. Chediak said. Rigorous studies have not been done. He suspects that the main effect of pre-race insomnia will be on mental performance, he said. But elite athletes cant take that chance. And some amateurs gunning for a personal record dont want to risk falling short, either. The trick is to be well prepared, said Meb Keflezighi, the United States marathon runner who won a silver medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics. In the weeks leading up to a race, he will have trained and visualized the course, planning his strategy. Finally, when the big day is nigh, he usually can drift off. At the very least, Mr. Keflezighi said, he has learned to avoid the sort of experience he had in 1996, when he was running a five-kilometer national championship race in Eugene, Ore. I told my coach I was going to win it and get the record, Mr. Keflezighi said. He was so excited that he tossed and turned all night before the race, sleepless, rehearsing the race in his mind. The next day, when the starting gun went off, Mr. Keflezighi did his best  and came in ninth. The problem, he says now, was what happened the night before, when he was lying in bed: I already ran that race  in my head. 
 Sometimes, especially the last week or so, when I'm at work or something, it feels like my body is on auto-pilot. It feels so weird. I'll even be talking to someone, and then I'll kinda "wake up" and still be talking. It's like I'm in a dream. I have no idea how my body knows what to do, and my mind knows what to say. I'm in my own little world, and my body is just doing what it has to do to make it through the day. What the heck is that all about? I wonder if has something to do with depression. I'm waiting to get my insurance cards so I can find a therapist. I hope they are not too expensive. I was reading a symptom guide for depression. I have it all. Uncontrollable crying.......especially before bed, feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness. It really does seem like things will never get better. I used to dream (over 7 years ago!) of what my adult life would be like. I thought I would have lots of friends, a wonderful boyfriend, and a career I was passionate about. Now I have 1 long time friend, been used by 2 guys last year, and work part time at a dead end job. I've started wondering what the point is to try and make my life better. I wish I could just leave this world, but I have to stay because I don't want to ruin anyone else's life. Like my mom, and my brother, and some older people I've befriended who I know genuinely care about me. Also, this might seem weird, but I couldn't leave my cats behind either. Somedays, they are the only ones who will bring me joy. I thought I wanted to work with/for animals as a career, but often I become discouraged because of some dumb little thing. I know that's probably because I'm not strong now. I can't pinpoint only one thing that has weakened my spirit. I've also become very jaded and bitter. It's hard for me to see couples, and groups of friends having fun. I think about my old best friend, and how she must be living it up without me. We ended our friendship because of our guy friend she wanted all to herself. She felt I betrayed her by writing him through email. We talked that over, and everything seemed to be fine for a few months, but then she was always too busy for me. I told her how I felt about that, and she dumped me claiming she was a good and loyal friend for 16 years, and her actions proved that. I told her she was right, that her actions really are proving what kind of a friend she is......it was either her way or the highway (she didn't want to discuss why we weren't hanging out anymore....she said I was beating a dead horse which was funny because it was the first time I brought it up) Hmm, obviously I'm not over that yet. I was also having a hard time getting over being used. I worked with the guy, so I saw him alot. He kept telling me he liked me, but didn't want a relationship. I find it so difficult to move past how he couldn't have said that BEFORE we slept together. Get this, he lured me out of his apt. with ice cream....."let's get ice cream.." He understood I'm usually (used to be) childlike/playful. While on the street with every shop closed, not 10 minutes after, he starts explaining for the 1st time (we had been on a few dates before AND talked a lot at work) how he does not want to be in a relationship. It was like I was out of my body looking down on myself and saying look at what just happened you dumb idiot......you've been used. I went home, cried all night and the next day. Then for more than a year, he tries to get me to believe he really is a good guy, then poof, he's gone. I never hear from him again, except from his friends about what he used to say about me when he was drunk......very disrespectful. ANYWAY, I guess I can't seem to move past that either. Well, this is WAY TOO LONG of a post. I really do need to talk it all out with a therapist. But, thanks for listening to not even the half of it all. 
 'Junk sleep' damaging teenagers' health Aug 28, 2007 TV, computers among reasons kids ages 12-16 are staying awake, poll finds LONDON - British teenagers are damaging their health by not getting enough sleep because they are distracted by electronic gadgets in their bedrooms, according to a survey on Tuesday. Advice body The Sleep Council said "junk sleep" could rival the consumption of unhealthy junk food as a major lifestyle issue for parents of teenage children. Its poll of 1,000 youngsters aged 12 to 16 found that 30 percent managed just 4 to 7 hours sleep as opposed to the recommended 8 or 9 hours. Almost a quarter said they fell asleep more than once a week while watching TV, listening to music or using other electronic gadgets. "This is an incredibly worrying trend," said Dr Chris Idzikowski of the Edinburgh Sleep Centre. "What we are seeing is the emergence of Junk Sleep - that is sleep that is of neither the length nor quality that it should be in order to feed the brain with the rest it needs to perform properly at school." Nearly all the teenagers had a phone, music system or TV in their bedroom, with around two-thirds possessing all three. Almost one in five of the teenage boys said the quality of their sleep had been affected by leaving their TV or computer on. The survey also found that 40 percent of youngsters felt tired each day, with girls aged 15 to 16 faring the worst. However just 11 percent said they were bothered by the lack or quality of sleep. "I'm staggered that so few teenagers make the link between getting enough good quality sleep and how they feel during the day," Idzikowski said. "Teenagers need to wake up to the fact that to feel well, perform well and look well, they need to do something about their sleep." 
 Sleepless Kids Are Troubled Kids By E.J. Mundell, HealthDay News SUNDAY, Aug. 26, 2007 The nightly trip to dreamland is a frustrating one for millions of American children suffering from insomnia, night awakenings and even sleep apnea, experts say. "Across every study, 20 to 25 percent of children have some kind of sleep problem," said Jodi Mindell, associate director of the Sleep Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. "That spans everything from kids who are waking during the night, to resisting bedtime, to sleepwalking, disordered breathing -- the gamut," she said. One 2004 National Sleep Foundation poll found that, among children under 11, 60 percent experienced some kind of sleep trouble at least a few nights a week, Mindell said. "And 74 percent of parents said they wanted to change something about their child's sleep," she added. So, parents awakened in the night by a sleepless child have lots of company nationwide. One big culprit: sleep apnea, which occurs when blockages in the airway trigger snoring and frequent nighttime awakenings. "About 2 to 3 percent of children will have sleep apnea," said Mindell, co-author of Take Charge of Your Child's Sleep. "About 10 to 12 percent of kids snore on a regular basis, but not all children who snore have sleep apnea. In children, the primary cause of obstructive sleep apnea is enlarged tonsils or adenoids." In most cases, tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy offers a quick fix for pediatric sleep apnea, Mindell said. But there's another contributing factor that's rising in prevalence -- obesity. "In obese kids, what you're getting is the tonsils and adenoids being big, and then the weight on the neck closing the airways," she explained. The daytime drowsiness that comes with sleep apnea can greatly affect a child's mood, daytime alertness and academics. One 2006 study in the journal Public Library of Science Medicine found that youngsters with sleep apnea scored lower on standard IQ tests compared with unaffected kids -- an average of 85 points vs. 100, respectively. Left untreated, sleep apnea might even permanently damage cognitive function, the researchers said. "We can only assume that it could turn an otherwise smart kid into a mediocre kid," lead investigator Dr. Ann Halbower, of the John Hopkins University Children Center, told HealthDay. But there are other sleep woes affecting children, including insomnia, night terrors, and frequent awakenings and sleepwalking. Many can be fixed with simple behavioral changes at home, Mindell said. Those steps include: Setting firm schedules. "Get them to bed the same time every night and wake them up the same time every morning," Mindell said. "This sets a child's internal clock and makes it so they'll get sleepy easier and fall asleep easier."Create a bedtime routine. Implementing a "wind-down" time before bed, perhaps 20 to 30 minutes each night, helps kids of all ages settle down and ready their minds and bodies for sleep, Mindell said.Ban electronics from the bedroom. According to polls, 97 percent of U.S. kids have some kind of electronic distraction -- TV, cell phone, computer, Gameboy -- in their rooms. "That has a major impact on sleep," Mindell said. "We want to get kid's bedrooms unplugged."Limit caffeine. This doesn't mean only coffee -- it's ice tea, plus dark- and light-colored sodas. "For some kids it takes much longer to metabolize caffeine," Mindell said. "So, that ice tea at 3 o'clock in the afternoon can still be keeping them up at 10 p.m."Make sleep-time a solo affair. Kids who get used to a parent being with them as they drift off will need that parent every time they seek slumber. "So, if you're lying down with your 5-year-old at bedtime, be prepared to be lying down with him at 1 a.m.," Mindell warned. Allowing a child to fall asleep on his or her own eliminates that problem. School boards have an important role to play, too, Mindell said. "Many high schools are starting now at 7:15 in the morning, and that's completely against what is happening with teenagers' internal clocks," she explained. "Their clocks actually shift later [than adults] -- that's just a simple biological function." So, later school start times can make a big difference. According to Mindell, school districts that have made such a change "have seen huge, positive responses in their kids' grades."

 do dreams have any meaning at all or is it all just random? if it's not all random, where could i find reliable information on dream interpretation? 
 American Academy of Family Physicians Insomnia: How to Get a Good Night's Sleep What causes insomnia? Insomnia is the body's way of saying that something isn't right. Things that may cause insomnia include stress, too much caffeine, depression, changes in work shifts, and pain from medical problems, such as arthritis. Many people have insomnia. People who have insomnia may not be able to fall asleep. They may wake up during the night and not be able to fall back asleep, or they may wake up too early in the morning. Is insomnia a serious problem? It's not really a serious problem for your health, but it can make you feel tired, depressed and irritable. It can also make it hard to concentrate during the day. How much sleep do I need? Most adults need about 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night. You know you're getting enough sleep if you don't feel sleepy during the day. The amount of sleep you need stays about the same throughout adulthood. However, sleep patterns may change with age. For example, older people may sleep less at night and take naps during the day. What can my doctor do to find out why I'm not sleeping? Your family doctor may ask you and your bed partner some questions about your sleep habits (such as when you go to bed and when you get up), any medicine you take, and the amount of caffeine and alcohol you drink. Your doctor may also ask if you smoke. Other questions may include how long you've been having insomnia, if you have any pain (such as from arthritis), and if you snore while you sleep. Your doctor may also ask about events or problems in your life that may be upsetting you and making it hard for you to sleep. What is a sleep diary? If the cause of your insomnia is not clear, your doctor may suggest that you fill out a sleep diary. The diary will help you keep track of when you go to bed, how long you lie in bed before falling asleep, how often you wake during the night, when you get up in the morning and how well you sleep. A sleep diary may help you and your doctor identify patterns and conditions that may be affecting your sleep. How is insomnia treated? The treatment of insomnia can be simple. Often, once the problem that's causing the insomnia is taken care of, the insomnia goes away. The key is to find out what's causing the insomnia so that it can be dealt with directly. Simply making a few changes in their sleep habits helps many people. What can I do to improve my sleep habits? Here are some things you can do to help you sleep better: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends, even if you didn't get enough sleep. This will help train your body to sleep at night. Develop a bedtime routine. Do the same thing every night before going to sleep. For example, take a warm bath and then read for 10 minutes every night before going to bed. Soon you'll connect these activities with sleeping, and doing them will help make you sleepy. Use the bedroom only for sleeping or having sex. Don't eat, talk on the phone or watch TV while you're in bed. Make sure your bedroom is quiet and dark. If noise is a problem, use a fan to mask the noise or use ear plugs. If you must sleep during the day, hang dark blinds over the windows or wear an eye mask. If you're still awake after trying to fall asleep for 30 minutes, get up and go to another room. Sit quietly for about 20 minutes before going back to bed. Do this as many times as you need to until you can fall asleep. Will sleeping pills help? Sleeping pills can help in some cases, but they are not a cure for insomnia. They're only a temporary form of relief. They're best used for only a few days. Regular use can lead to rebound insomnia. This occurs when a person quits taking sleeping pills and his or her insomnia comes back. Sleeping pills can be unsafe to use if you have certain health problems. Ask your doctor if sleeping pills would be helpful for you. Tips to help you sleep Avoid or limit your use of caffeine (coffee, tea, sodas, chocolate), decongestants, alcohol and tobacco.Exercise more often, but don't exercise within a few hours before going to bed.Learn to reduce or manage the stress in your life.Don't lie in bed worrying about things. Set aside another time just for worrying. For example, spend 30 minutes after dinner writing down what's worrying you and what you can do about it.Try eating a light snack before going to bed, but don't eat too much right before bedtime. A glass of warm milk or some cheese and crackers may be all you need.Don't nap during the day if naps seem to make your insomnia worse. 
 Chronic Insomnia Linked to Depression, Anxiety Monday, July 9, 2007 By Amy Norton NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - For some people, chronic insomnia may be a sign of broader mental health problems like depression and anxiety, according to a new study. In surveys of more than 25,000 Norwegian adults, researchers found that those with chronic insomnia were more likely to also be suffering from depression or an anxiety disorder. What's more, people who reported insomnia during the first wave of the survey were at increased risk of having an anxiety disorder during the second wave, conducted a decade later. This, the researchers say, suggests that insomnia may either raise the risk of future anxiety problems, or be a sign that a person is particularly vulnerable to developing anxiety symptoms. The findings are published in the medical journal Sleep. Sleep problems are common in people with depression, anxiety and certain other mental health conditions. But whether insomnia can lead to depression or anxiety is unclear. To study the question, researchers led by Dr. Dag Neckelmann of Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, Norway, used data from a general health survey that followed 25,130 adults age 20 and older. Respondents were first surveyed between 1984 and 1986, then again between 1995 and 1997. Anxiety and depression symptoms were gauged during the second survey, with standard questions used to diagnose the disorders. In general, the researchers found, people with chronic insomnia during the first survey were more likely to have anxiety disorder symptoms during the second survey -- as were respondents who had insomnia during the second survey only. This suggests that, in some people, insomnia could signal a current anxiety disorder, or be a risk factor for developing anxiety down the road, according to Neckelmann's team. In contrast, there was no evidence that insomnia was a risk factor for future depression. Instead, people with insomnia during the second survey were at heightened risk of current depression -- indicating that insomnia and depression commonly co-exist. The findings, Neckelmann told Reuters Health, point to the importance of seeking help for chronic insomnia, as well as being evaluated for any symptoms of depression or an anxiety disorder. Each of these disorders, the researcher noted, can be treated with non-drug options, like cognitive behavioral therapy. However, Neckelmann said, while this study suggests that insomnia may be a risk factor for anxiety, it's not yet clear whether treating insomnia lowers the odds of future anxiety disorders.

 Poor Memory Tied to Sleep Woes in Aging Women Anxieties or early dementia might be to blame, researchers say By Robert Preidt TUESDAY, July 17 (HealthDay News) -- Older women with memory problems are more likely to have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep than those without memory loss, a U.S. study finds. The study included almost 2,500 women, average age 69, with no signs of memory problems at the start of the study. They underwent cognitive tests over a period of 15 years and, at the end of the study, were assessed for sleep problems. Women who showed signs of mental decline on the tests "were nearly twice as likely to have difficulty staying asleep and one-and-a-half times as likely to have problems falling asleep and being awake for more than 90 minutes during their sleep cycle," study author Dr. Kristine Yaffe, of the University of California, San Francisco, said in a prepared statement. "Women who declined on one of the tests were also nearly twice as likely to nap more than two hours a day," Yaffe said. There was no association between cognitive decline and total sleep time, said the study, which is published in the July 17 issue of the journal Neurology. "Perhaps the most likely reason why memory loss may increase the risk of sleep disturbances is that they share a common underlying cause, such as brain changes seen in Alzheimer's disease or other dementias that could increase risk of both memory loss and sleep problems," Yaffe said. "Another reason could be that women with memory problems may also have anxiety or depression that could affect their sleep. While we attempted to adjust for these measures in our study, it's possible that this effect remains," she said. 
 Many insomniacs turn to valerian and melatonin July 4, 2007 A study published in the July 1st issue of the journal SLEEP finds that large segments of the U.S. population use valerian or melatonin to treat their insomnia. The study, authored by Donald L. Bliwise, PhD, of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, focused on the data collected from 31,044 individuals from the 2002 Alternative Health/Complementary and Alternative Medicine Supplement to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Dr. Bliwise discovered that, of the survey sample, 5.9 percent used valerian and 5.2 percent used melatonin. Relatively greater use occurred in individuals under the age of 60. The decision to use such substances was made in consultation with a health care provider less than half of the time. "Within the United States, usage of alternative and complementary medicine is rising dramatically," said Bliwise. "Within the limitations on the NHIS methodology, the usage of valerian and the usage of melatonin appear to be relatively high. Specific data on valerian usage and on melatonin usage in general populations, however, are relatively scarce." However, an evaluation of common oral non-prescription treatments for insomnia conducted by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine's (AASM) clinical practice review committee did not find a beneficial effect for many of the herbal supplements, dietary changes and other nutritional supplements popularly used for treating insomnia symptoms, including valerian and melatonin. The AASM does not support the use of such products for treating symptoms of insomnia as set out in the Academy's position statement. Behavioral therapies and medications have been shown to be effective therapies for insomnia. Behavioral therapies use non-pharmacologic methods to improve sleep, and are effective and long-lasting. Sleep medications are effective and safe treatments for insomnia when used properly and judiciously by a patient who is under the supervision of a sleep medicine or primary care physician. A physician should always be consulted before any medications are taken. Insomnia is a classification of sleep disorders in which a person has trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early. These disorders may also be defined by an overall poor quality of sleep. Insomnia is the most commonly reported sleep disorder. About 30 percent of adults have symptoms of insomnia. Less than 10 percent of adults are likely to have chronic insomnia. Insomnia is more common among elderly people and women. While a brief case of insomnia can arise due to temporary stress, excitement or other emotion, more than 20 million Americans report having a chronic form of insomnia that keeps them from sleeping well nearly every night. As a result, insomnia can lead to severe daytime fatigue, poor performance at school and work, physical symptoms such as headaches and, in some cases, anxiety or depression. Those who think they might have insomnia, or another sleep disorder, are urged to discuss their problem with their primary care physician, who will issue a referral to a sleep specialist.

 Hi. As some of you know, I'm under a lot of stress right now and am having frequent early morning awakening. This broken sleep is so exhausting. I wake up most mornings practically more tired than when I went to bed. Well, I saw my GP this morning. As I expected, she was supportive and reassuring. She said is understandable I am having trouble sleeping at the moment with all the stress I am dealing with. That helped a lot, to hear that. That how my body and mind are responding is normal in the circumstances. No advice really though. I can take zopiclone if I need to. I am going to take Tuesday off work, and at least work are aware that I am exhausted. I'm going to go offline earlier this evening, and see if that helps. Any other tips that might help me sleep better are welcome! Thanks. 
 I told my Mum earlier today about this dream I had last evening. I told her it would sound better after I'd written it down, so here it is... My dream was that the future of the human race was in jepoardy. Pregnant women everywhere were spontaneously aborting their foetuses. Upon further examination of these foetuses, they all had one thing in common - one gene was lacking in their DNA, therefore, none of them were viable. This meant no new humans could be born. Or so we thought... It became apparent that there was a secluded community similar to the Amish community whose women were giving birth to babies quite normally. This was the only community in the world who wasn't lacking this gene. The team I was a part of decided we would approach this community to ask if we could take some DNA samples. We planned to repopulate the gene pool with the missing gene. Unaware of our plight, when we arrived, the community became scared and began attacking us with primative weapons such as bows and arrows. The men in our team fought back but did so without the intent to harm or kill. Since we had the means to basically slaughter this community, we wished them no harm so our tactic was to keep them 'fighting' until they exhausted their arsenal. No one was injured from their community. Meanwhile, I sneaked into their compound and found myself in what looked to be a teaching room with mahogany panelled walls and mahogany desks. The idea was for me to penetrate the community from within; to at least begin to speak with the women and ask for their help. While in the room, a young man of around 18-22 entered. He was all the way into the room, door already closed behind him before we saw each other. We were both alarmed at the sight of each other. The young man looked like a college footballer. He was tall and had blond hair. There was suddenly signs of fighting out in the corridor so I gestured for the young man to follow me into a room within this teaching room for safety. I discovered it was a bathroom housing a sink, toilet and bath with a shower over the bath. We closed the door behind us and when we heard fighting in the teaching room, we both got into the bath and pulled the shower curtain across. We stayed their silently until we heard no more noise from the teaching room. The fighters had moved away. I introduced myself but he looked confused. He then spoke in a language I assumed to be German but since I didn't know any German, I couldn't be sure. We eventually managed to figure out each other's names. I tried to speak more with him and he tried too but we weren't having much success. We then 'spoke' in a language common to all human beings... Afterwards, the young man ran off as if embarrassed by what we did. It suddenly dawned on me what this meant and I was so excited! My team had worn the community down and they surrendered to us. Thankfully no one was hurt but before our leader spoke to their leader about why we were here, I needed to speak with him. I told him what had just happened and he was extremely disgusted with me. He shouted at me and called me derogatory names. I couldn't really blame him. There was no excuse for my behaviour but he had to know. I pleaded, "Can't you see what this means?" "I can see what it means all right!" he yelled, "You are an immoral woman!" "From that point of view, yes, I am an immoral woman," I agreed, "But if it turns out I'm pregnant and the foetus is viable, my child will have the gene we need to repopulate our gene pool!" The understanding crept across his face like the sun moving from behind a cloud. He was delighted! All negative feelings of my deed had vanished. "We must get you home and take care of you..." he planned. "No," I objected, "It's far too early for that, "We don't know if I've conceived yet." "Ok. Well when we know that you've conceived, we'll take you home. Then I'll tell the leader of this community that we thought we needed his help but we no longer need it." "I'm staying here," I said firmly. "If they learn I'm pregnant - I'm sure at some point the young man will tell someone what we did - and I just disappear, they'll think we've manipulated the whole thing when they learn about what's been happening in the rest of the world. That would be no better than stealing. I still want to ask his permission if we can use this DNA, assuming I'll conceive. And just so he and the rest of the community know that we appreciate their help and are not just going to walk away from them after they've helped us, I want to stay here for the whole pregnancy and deliver the baby here." Our leader didn't like this idea but I insisted. ****** I did become pregnant and stayed until I delivered but the labour was as far as the dream went as I woke up just before the baby was born. Thanks for reading. 
 Insomnia and Psychiatric Illness By Kristina R. Anderson May 23, 2007 SAN DIEGO, CA -- There is a prevalence of insomnia seen in psychiatric illness although insomnia itself can be a risk factor for psychiatric disorders. That's according to research presented here on at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). "Clearly, of those with and without insomnia, the insomnia group has a higher incidence of depression and anxiety disorders," said Meera Narasimhan MD, Professor of Psychiatry, Director, Biological Research, Dept. of Neuropsychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia, United States. Narasimhan said 50% to 80% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have insomnia. And a persistent case of insomnia augments a lifetime risk of MDD. There is an invisible patient population where 70% of people with insomnia never discuss the problem with treating physicians. Only 8% of those with insomnia manage to see a psychiatrist and of that group, 52% have one-to-three comorbid illnesses. Sixty-nine percent have four or more comorbidities. "We need to do a better job accessing these individuals," said Narasimhan. Some of the comorbid conditions include:  bipolar disorders with prevalence rates of circadian rhythm instability and insomnia as high as 77%  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with prevalence rates as high as 70%  schizophrenia, which is a condition frequently associated with sleep disturbance and insomnia. Some more common causes of insomnia include primary sleep disorders, medical illness, mood disorders, dementia, psychosis, anxiety, medications, and psychosocial stress. The impact of insomnia include exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms and increased risk of relapse; reduction in mental performance and motor functioning; accidents; suicide; inability to accomplish daily tasks and interpersonal difficulties with families, friends, and at work. Drugs can cause insomnia and the most likely culprits include illicit drugs, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, stimulants, medications such as beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, and even some antidepressants. "The common denominator in insomnia is hyperarousal and an activation of the HPA axis," said Narasimhan, who also noted there is an activation of the autonomic nervous system with EEG changes and an increased metabolic rate. There is a shared neurobiology that explains the commonality of insomnia and depression. Candidate genes are currently being studied as well as serotonin gene polymorphisms. Some of the risk factors for insomnia in depression, Narasimhan said, are age, female sex, single marital status, lower socioeconomic status, sleep abnormalities in endogenous MDD, early morning awakening, increased wakefulness, decreased arousal threshold, prolonged sleep latency, and shortened REM latency, and HPA activation in depression. "It makes sense to use an antidepressant," said Narasimhan "We know that they act beyond the surface and in looking at neurotrophic factors, which may in turn explain restoration of homeostasis, they may play role in plasticity." Narasimhan suggests that psychiatrists get a good initial assessment in patients with insomnia and psychiatric illness by checking the following:  sleep history  a sleep diary  rule in/out primary psychiatric disorders  rule out adverse effects of medications  sleep hygiene measures  daytime naps  bedtime mood  psychotrophic use  treatments to decrease rates of relapse "Insomnia and psychiatric disorders go hand in hand and they can overlap in neurobiology substrate and circuitry that require early recognition, accurate diagnosis, and we need to promote treatment," Narasimhan concluded. "Good sleep hygiene is a vital component of treatment." [Presentation title: Making Every Sheep Count: Evidence-Based Approaches to Treating Insomnia. Abstract 581] 
 I don't want to focus before I go to sleep on what happened, but I would love to be able to train my mind on one particular repetitive nightmare. In reality, the man that attacked me, got in while I was sleeping and attacked me, but in one repetitive nightmare I feel as if I am looking down on myself, fast asleep; I can also see him coming up the stairs. I feel I've got to wake myself to get to the door to secure it before he can get in; I have managed to do this twice and then woken up. I would like to be able to train my mind to be able to get to that door each time so that I can go to sleep knowing that I wouldn't be frightened of it again. I know the reality of it can't be changed, but maybe I can do something about that nightmare. Any ideas would be appreciated. NightOwl 
 I am going through a spate of nightmares again. In the past few days I have dreamt that I was the sole survivor in a bomb explosion in which my father died, and then another night, seeing many of the bullies again in my old secondary school. Although thankfully they didn't see me. And last night I don't remember my dreams from the first part of the night, but I woke up terrified of there being a ghost in the flat. I told my therapist today, and we worked with them a bit. She also did some gentle focusing-breathing work with me, which may have made some difference, although at the time I was fighting it, trying to control things by 'stopping' breathing. I just ended up frustrating myself...and feeling disappointed. The nightmares are actually not so terrible, when I work with them, but the symbolism is so traumatic.... I am not getting any real restful sleep, even though mirtazapine, which I am on, is supposed to be good for PTSD nightmares. *sigh* I want to get some grasp of things before the Easter therapy break [week after next] otherwise I'll be a nervous wreck... I do visualisation and fantasy of my safe place when I get into bed each night, and tonight I'll try the breathing as well. Any more tips gratefully welcome. Please. Thanks. 
 Help for Restless Legs ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (Ivanhoe Broadcast News) -- Imagine whenever you're not moving, your legs are uncomfortable and throbbing. It's a problem many people just live with. It's called restless legs syndrome. And now there's a new treatment option making it easy for patients to get relief. Relaxing to read is a great achievement for Beverly Cato. It may seem simple, but she hasn't been able to do it for years. "I thought it was normal," she says. "I just thought it was me -- a constant need to move. It's uncontrollable." Cato suffers from restless legs syndrome. She had to constantly move her legs, which was a real problem at night. Sleep was next to impossible. "There's no relief, your legs are just constantly tense and unless you move, you get a bit relief," she says. "A lot of people feel like they are going crazy," Steven Cohen, M.D., Ph.D., a neurologist at Suncoast Medical Clinic in St. Petersburg, Fla., tells Ivanhoe. Yet restless legs syndrome affects up to 10 percent of the population. Dr. Cohen says the key thing is RLS not present when people are up and walking. It's only when they are sitting or lying down. Dr. Cohen says, while neurologists don't know what causes it, researchers do know the same dopamine medications used to treat Parkinson's disease can help patients -- another mystery! "Why the extra dopamine helps in restless legs syndrome we don't know," he says Dr. Cohen. Oral medications were available in the past, but now new research shows a patch with the drug rotigotine is an even better choice. "Not everyone has gotten 100 percent relief, but everyone that I've seen has gotten pretty good relief," Dr. Cohen says. "The major benefit is you put it on and forget it." There's one unusual side effect that can happen and that is the need to gamble. Dr. Cohen says it is rare, but is something he does caution patients about. Another benefit with the patch is fewer side effects than oral drugs. The patch is approved in Europe and in the process of FDA approval in the United States. It's working for Cato. Every day when she puts on her make up, she also puts on her patch so she can live life without restless legs. If you would like more information, please see the Suncoast Medical Clinic website.

 Unwanted Thoughts By Carlin Flora, Psychology Today Things we sweep under the rug and thoughts we try not to think about fill our minds while we dream. Trying hard not to think about an old love? Don't be surprised if he stampedes through your dreams like the proverbial elephant. When subjects were told to avoid thinking about a certain someone before falling asleep, they were more likely to dream of that person than subjects asked to purposefully keep someone in mind. And, whereas Freud believed only desirable targets would assert themselves in dreams, subjects dreamed just as often of people to whom they were not attracted as they did of attractive targets. "Things we sweep under the rug fill our minds while we dream," says Daniel Wegner, lead researcher and professor of psychology at Harvard University, which explains why smokers trying to quit, for example, tend to dream about lighting up. The study pokes holes in a popular theory that says dreaming is the brain's way of interpreting random activations. "This proves that some dreams are not random; they do come from prior contentparticularly content you're trying to block out," he says. Wegner describes the phenomenon in terms of two mental processesone keeps the brain on task, while an opposing "ironic" system scouts out the very thoughts we are consciously trying to keep at bay. "While we sleep, the system engaged in mental control is not very operative," Wegner says, which leaves the ironic system free to take over, and release unwanted thoughts into the wild. 
 When I was a child, I use to have horrific nightmares and never told anyone until 2 months before my mom died, I told her... Occassionally when I am in bed and I close my eyes I will have horrible images and last night i kept having them but I was calm...usually i toss and turn and try to block them out...I can't describe them b/c of saying to much on here... But they are of something that should upset me...I know I am being vague but...i told my T I had nightmares as a child and she asked if I remembered them and I said yes, but i didn't share them with her.... She has not been told about the awake images...Honestly I don't know why I am posting this................RIMH 
 Its nearly 9pm here. And once again I am scared. My flatmates are away in India for another month. There is noone in the flat upstairs, and the family downstairs are away just now. So I am alone in the house. I can, thankfully, lock my room door, and always do so, even with my flatmates here. [the people in the flat upstairs,when there is someone there, have to walk through our flat]. If there is a door I can lock, I always lock it. Also, I've been having nightmares again the past week or so. I take remeron at night, and that helps a bit. And of course I am working hard in therapy, and all the time. I am doing all I can to reassure and comfort the child parts/feeling states. When I was a child, I had nightime anxiety and nightmares and was often scared at night. A few times I 'saw' things in the dark of my room. It may have been sinusitis medication induced [I was on piriton and phenergan syrups, and otrivine nasal drops, for years...] But also could equally been suppressed anxiety induced. I'm scared. 
 Just curious... My spouse doesn't sleep walk but he is very active when he sleeps/dreams. Last night he elbowed me in the nose, it was quite painful but it was obvious that it was part of a his dream/nightmare so I'm not angry with him - just a little nervous. He has done things like this in the past but last night was the worst. Is there any way to help stop this? thanks, jm 
 Not sure where to post this, but I think this is probably where it should go.. I had such a weird dream last night that woke me at 4:30am and I couldnt sleep the rest of the night, because the same dream kept wanting to repeat itself! I was in an airport with my mother and sister, and I walked to where they were standing with all the luggage. I looked at my carry on bag, and it was all but empty. I asked my mother where my camera (very expensive camera) was and she said she packed it in the check in bag that was already gone.. I started screaming that I will never see that camera again now, and do you really expect it to be in the luggage when we get to the other end? She said nothing, but I kept screaming these words, and nobody was paying me any attention. I screamed till I had no voice left, then started crying, and asking why people thought so little about my stuff and whats important to me? I was quiet the whole trip, got to baggage, opened it, and no camera. I just left the luggage on the floor, and walked out. I quit my job, and moved 3000 miles away, and just cut everyone out of my life... This dream really shook me for some reason, and it is still bothering me several hours later! Thank GOD I talk to my therapist tonight. He is always asking me about my dreams, and now I have one I remember, and can tell him about. Whats really scary is I put myself through the ringer when I am dreaming this, and I FEEL every emotion and feel like I was actually screaming and crying. (I wasnt) What on earth do you all think this is about? Gosh, my poor mother in the dream. I feel quilty and its only a dream!! Help!
