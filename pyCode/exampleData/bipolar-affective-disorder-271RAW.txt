I have not had an episode of Bipikar Disorder in over 20 years.  Prior to that I used to cut myself and have my stomach regularly pumped from suicide attempts. Ive spent years in counseling, taking my meds and group therapy.  But I was always told that it was always there and could come back at any time.  Anyone else with a similar success story?  
I'm a private guy and this is my last resort! I've been with my girlfriend since June last year - we are both 40 next month - I love her too bits without question and outside work this is the first time I've been exposed to mental health issues ( I hate the phrase mental health as it purports a negative stigma). When we got together very early on my partner told me she suffered with bipolar - I'm a level headed guy so I took it upon myself too research the condition from various sources to get as much information as I could. I can now see the manic and depressive triggers - I've tried all the support mechanisms I have read about - being supportive, being understanding, giving space and not pressuring, being over concerned, arguing back and being assertive (which I hate). When we are good we are good but far too frequently I receive negative comments, more often personal and insulting comments, all the time I get told stories of her past life and relationships which I'm told were so fantastic, I constantly get told her life now (which I take to be the life with me) is so boring and rubbish - I was sat on the sofa 2 days ago and we were talking about going on our first holiday together in May and then my girlfriend descended into a calm but hurtful rhetoric of how she would ignore me if I wore the shorts and t-shirts that I own - how she would not talk too me if I used the goggles I use in the pool at the gym whilst on holiday - small insignificant things but after so much insults over the last few months - I started to cry! What took the biscuit is on the 18th Feb my daughter from my previous marriage would have been 4 years old! I mentioned this just in passing on the 19th Feb whilst we were watching telly as a similar subject came up on the programme and my partner acknowledged what I had said (she new about it from early doors) and then immediately started taking about her abortion 12 years ago which was her choice to have as her relationship at that time was going nowhere which I also new about. Yesterday we were fine - really good, tonight I'm getting a barrage of txts saying we are over, she can't see me or talk too me - I'm thinking she is in a depressive cycle and this has happened before on 3 or 4 occasions - I love this girl so much but I'm needing help as too what if anything I can do more to help - any comments really much appreciated! 
I've suffered for 8 years now as well as a ED nobody understands what it's like feel like I'm going through it on my own, not an illness I choose to have unfortunatley I have and can't do anything about it.

I have bipolar disorder, personality disorder, anxiety disorder and OCD. I experienced an abusiive childhood which I think contributed to my mental health problems that and a large history of it on my mothers side. I feel completely alone I can't cope in social situations I'm afraid when I leave the house I have a partner who drinks loads and is horrible to be when he does but I'm afraid to leave him as I can't do anything alone like going to the shops I have 4 children and I'm pregnant I cope well with my children in the house but feel like I failure as it's me that does everything for them in the house like reading to them playing with them brushing their teeth doing their homework but I can't do the school runs because of all the people down there I suffer panic attacks when out there the only things that give me reason to live I feel stuck in this realstionship because of not being able to take them to school I'm in loads of debt because of my bipolar I don't have a close family support network and no friends I feel so alone I'm so depressed at the moment and really lacking energy hormones are not helping either my mental health team are useless here they don't help at all the last person I saw had a go ate when he found out I was pregnant saying people like you shouldn't have kids my children ate the only things in my life I'm proud off. 
 Hi had big argument with spouse , a lot of mean things were exchanged . All of a sudden it sounded like crap my father used to tell me , I'd never be any good at anything , no one would care or love me .. I e been crying since , I'm bipolar rapid cycled / depression .  I've  had moments but all in all I'm pretty stable . I wonder what's going on ?  
I have been diagnsoed with bipolar over a year ago. Though i have a lot more depressive moods rather than mania. I also have various twitches too. This has gone on for most of my life i am 46yrs old. I have been on various medication was put on lithium over a year ago but i didnt take to it well and it made me more depressed. I am now on 210mgs of lofepramine. For a good six months things were ok but since december i have been very depressed (this tends to happen in december), full of hatred for people and angry. I had to leave my job as a teaching assistant as it was too much. I have been working at tesco four mornings a week on stock control 5am-9am i am a dog walker too. My husband completely backs away from me and doesnt understand i am left feeling very alone. I have said to him i am only here until the dogs (we have 4) die as i cannot die before them as they will be split up and put in separate homes as my husband works long hours i couldnt bear the thought of that. I have tried attempting suicide twice taking tablets. Yesterday i was very manic went for a run walked the dogs for two hours came home and did housework whilst drinking wine then went out at 2 to go to the shop and buy 2 mini bottles of wine some water and sweets. Walked around the area for 4 hours drinking the wine and thinking i was invincible. Came home drank and cried and cant remember anything else! My husband has not spoke to me since Friday as he quote 'cant deal with me when i am like this'. Today i have spent all day in bed feeling empty and worthless.  Does anyone else have a husband who doesnt understand and ignores you? It makes me feel unloved especially when i am really low. When i am good its great but that isnt very often. My husband never asks how my day has been what i have done he has his tea falls asleep on the computer then in bed by 9 as i am up so early in the mornings. I am proud that i have managed to keep my job but i think it is mainly because i dont speak to people during the time i am in. I just want a cuddle and to be told i will be ok. I think i am going to have to change medication oh and last week when i was down then great the next day he said to me 'you must have taken your happy pills have you'? which really hurt me. Does anyone else have a husband like this? And have more depressed days than manic days? 
I'm in the process of being diagnosed bipolar and I think I may be suffering from anorexia. I'm a single mother of 2 beautiful children  please don't think I'm a bad person   
1 month before I said this to my GP, I had asked her if she suspected it as a possibility as she suggested I stay on antidepressants for life to prevent further depressive episodes (ongoing since preteens. Now aged 30). She said there was no way I was bipolar.  She started me on AD's and 3-4 weeks later I was back seeing another GP complaining about my mood shift and massive spending spree. I initially thought I needed my AD's increased.   After this, I thought about the previous doctor mentioning depressive 'episodes' again. I researched bipolar and it described me to a T.  It seemed the start of AD's had possibly triggered hypomania/mania.  I became so focused on this and obsessively researched it and couldnt let it lie. I went back to see the GP who prescribed the AD's and told her my thoughts.  She agreed it is quite possible and was about to refer me to a psychiatrist when she saw the previous doctor had already made a referral (the doc I spoke to about my mood change and spending spree).  She just added onto the referral that I was hypomanic and she wants a follow up appointment with me to gather more information to pass over to the psychiatrist. My appointment has came through before we have had this follow up. I suggested I stopped my AD's and she advised me not to just yet. I did anyway and feel better for it. I have been able to sleep again!  It is quite frustrating as ive suffered depression since age 10/11. Been on and off anti depressants since age 16 - none of which have really helped.  I think I have had them all! Why have they not referred me already?   Anyway, does it it take long for the psychiatrist to diagnose? Im actually seeing a bit of light at the end of the tunnel. I might actually get the correct help so that i can have a better quality life! 
Bipolar boyfriend of 1& 1/2 years was kind of giving me the cold shoulder about 2 weeks ago when I was staying at his place. That was new; sure he has been up and down in the past but never aimed his moodiness at me before. I thought things were going great up till then. He text me the next day saying a lot of things are bothering him and he needs time to think and he will let me know when he is ready to talk. That whole weekend I did not text or call him. He keeps playing words with friends w/ me which is slightly weird but okay. He sent me a text on Sunday apologizing bout being so quiet he just has a lot of things to sort out. I said I am here for him when he wants to talk. He appreciated it but just wasn't ready to talk about it, again. He asked me Monday if I would still help him with his taxes. I said no problem. I thought I would go over to his place knock them out in an hour or so then hopefully we could talk about what was bothering him. No such luck. I helped him with his taxes, and then kind of lingered around hoping he would bring things up. So I just said so whatâs going on? And he just shook his head & said I am so not ready to have that conversation right now. I said why not, we are both here in person. I don't want to have these discussions over text. He said he did not either but I keep pushing and he is not ready. Which I did not think I was pushing, but maybe so. So I backed off and said okay take the time you need. I was getting so upset and hurt by this time I started thinking I needed to get all my stuff out of his place. So I said I need to get my charger and may as well get my board games etc... I was trying not but was crying a little while I was trying to round up my stuff. And he said I don't know why you think you have to do that right now. I said what am I suppose to think? He said he did not know what to think either. He was not giving me any clue bad or good to what is on his mind about us. I have read articles on people in bipolar relationships and how you should stay present. Don't talk about the issues bothering them but still be present and continue life 2gether. Should I invite him to go fishing or something tomorrow and not talk about those things and just have a good time or should I remain silent until he comes to me ready to talk? 
Hi there,  I am not sure if I have the correct forum to ask a question but here i go...I met the most wonderful man 7 months ago, he is sweet caring and kind and i love him dearly. He told me 3 months into the relationship when he was questioning going forward that he had Bipolar Disorder. I didnt know much about it so i researched it and said i would support him and be there for him. He began his medication again and things are great. I didnt see him for a week or so and when i did he seemed very depressed and sad. I got anexity and thought he wasnt interested in me and he reminded me that it is part of his Bipolar disorder. My question is, how do i support him when he is depressed? Is asking things like are you okay? and how are you doing annoying? i feel like it would get annoying and i dont wanna irritate him with that, but i also want to be by his side when he is going through the depression because i know he cant help it. Any advice for what to do to support him? Thanks so much 
My husband has ultradian bi polar it has just had this new name give by usa and uk nhs it means that he has the normal waves of up and down BUT in any24hr period rapid changes as well they peak up or down according to main wave pattern so very hard to live with as even with meds to do not know what comes next he has had it for over 30years in the begining no real name but  it was labeled in the 90s they used the term bi polar he has been one the same meds for over 10 years and is as stable as possible we have learnt to live with the changes in his moods. Ajust and cope are my motto 
I can't put my family through me being ill again  
I wl be 50 on my next bday. Today i have spent crying over feeling desperate to feel ok, or desperate to feel like i am worthy of living. I was diagnosed at age 26 and have been on and off meds, and am currently self medicating because it works best. But i know ot will kill me if i dont stop.  
Hi, my husband had a manic episode in may last year. He was sectioned under section two. The episode last 5months in total (with no medication). As he came down from the episode he sunk into a depression and has now been in that depression for 6 months. We have been battling his depression by our selfs as  he was reluctant to seek help, he was scared he would be sectioned again! We finally spoke to his social worker last week and although i am constantly having to phone as chase him up on things, i believe we will start getting more support.  The thing that im finding the hardest is my husbands behaviour towards me!!! The last few days he has become so cold towards me........ignoring me, no physical contact at all, looking at me as if he hates me. Im worried that this sudden change in behaviour could be a sign  that another manic episode is on its way (he completely turned against me during his last episode and walked out on our 10year relationship and toddler). I am just hypo sensitive to the situation and completely exhausted by it or could this be the beginning of a manic episode. (My husband hasnt been diagnosed with bipolar but care in the community are on the look out for it, although we only see them for 30mins every 3-8weeks! My husband is not currently on any medication.)            
Ive been on anti depressants for years, have had extreme obsessive thoughts. I go back to the doctor today to tell them 150mg of sertraline is not working for me. Im so tired all the time even after a full night sleep.  All they doing is sending me for another blood test and maybe change my medication after that. Tbh theres so much more I wana say to them that I cant squeeze into a 10 minute appointment.  Half the time I dint even leave the house. I just have no drive or motivation. Then sudden bursts of energy.  I want to be referred to a psychiatrist but they won't do it. 
Hi all  I have just joined this site as I'm in a new relationship with someone with a diagnosed cyclothymic bipolar guy who is medicated with lithium. I'm sorry if this is too long but this is all very bizarre to me!  We have been dating for over two months now, he has been sweet, attentive, affectionate and manic which I haven't had a problem with. He's funny and silly which is great because I'm more of a reserved personality and he brings me out of my shell.  From about a month in he was desperate to tell me he loved me but I held him back because it was too soon. Two months in and I have fallen for him hard, two weeks ago he actually told me he loved me properly and last week I told him I loved him too, things turned more passionate and intense.  However, the week after this particular weekend he went quiet on me. I hadn't heard from him for two days so debated about calling him. I called him and we had a good conversation. I said to him that I hadn't heard from him and he said "I was thinking the same thing just now". He asked me if I wanted to meet him for coffee on Thursday which we've done in the past, before I go to my evening classes. For some reason, my gut feeling was that he wasn't going to turn up. I'm glad I didn't wait for him because I text him half an hour after we were supposed to meet and an hour after I got a reply saying that he was doing some gardening and completely forgot. He also apologised. I went off on one basically saying that this spoke volumes and how he hasn't bothered to talk to me even though previously he had been bombarding me with texts/calls every single day since we met. He told me to chill, that there was no agenda, he is very absent minded about these things and that with previous gf's texts became more and more infrequent when they weren't in each other's company as the relationship went on so it's not an issue of him going off me.  Anyway, I gave him a bit of grief that night about it. I asked if he was still bothered to see me. He told me of course and to stop acting like that. I went to see him on Friday and spent till this morning (Monday) with him.  Friday was great, mucking around and sleeping together like we always do. Saturday night he spent pretty much all of the day video gaming. I needed to do some work on an essay so I didn't mind this. We did it again in the late afternoon to which he went back to his gaming without even asking me if I would mind. I went downstairs and did some more work and later in the evening he came down. That night, I was feeling so frustrated that I denied him that night.  The next morning (Sunday), we got up late, I had a shower, went downstairs to do some washing up and sat down in the living room. He came down and he asked when I was thinking of leaving and I said "Why? Do you want me to leave?". His reply was "Yes, I do." He went upstairs and came back down again. And I asked him why he wanted me to go when usually he's asking me to spend an extra night with him. His response was that he wasn't feeling it anymore and didn't want to be with me. He said I was too serious and didn't like the fact I was studying psychotherapy and he fears I'm psychoanalysing him. I told him that I'm not too serious, he has only seen one side of me. I've met his friends and family but he hasn't seen me around my friends and my family and we're always over at his house, we don't go out so there's no way for him to see another side of me. I can be a fun person to be around plus he makes me silly and I'm silly with him. I also mentioned that I was planning on asking him to come with me to my friends party the following weekend as a way of seeing this other happy, fun side. As for the psychotherapy, I said to him that the therapy I was doing was couple therapy and I don't learn about mental disorders. In fact, I know hardly anything about bipolar and that this is a new experience for me too. He also said that he pretends to be this fun, upbeat person to distract away from the fact that sometimes he wants to kill himself.  I said to him I just don't understand how he can go from really liking someone to never wanting to see them again. I said to him, but you enjoy sleeping with me too? To which he laughed. I said so you don't enjoy it? And he said no. I know this is a lie because he's obsessed with me going down on him and he said I'm the best at it out of all the gf's he's ever had. We've had marathons, he's said in the past that he loves that I'm a goer, can keep up with him and he loves how the time just flies when he sleeps with me with me which implies he doesn't find it boring. The only thing I think he's had a problem with was me denying him on Saturday night and the fact that he feels he's doing all the work because I'm not comfortable with going on top. He then said, I'm a bad person, I'm not a catch, look at me, I don't even know why you want to be with me? I told him that I loved him and cared for him and that there doesn't need to be a reason for why I feel that way about him. He said to me that you can't force someone to be with them. I said yes but he's also taking away my choice. Surely it's my choice, my decision whether to love this "bad person" and that it's up to me to decide whether he's a bad catch. He then mentioned something about going on a break etc. I told him that I don't need a man but I want to be with him. He switched on the TV at this point and started laughing at something on it. Casually he said, but I know it wouldn't be the last time I would here from you, I didn't understand what he meant by this.  I sat in silence for a bit with my arms folded and a broody pout holding back the tears with him still laughing at the TV. He then, got up, came to sit next to me and said "give me a hug". I did that shy thing of saying no and eventually hugged him. The same thing happened when he said "give me a kiss". And then eventually he said, do you want to have sx? We slept together and after that he was all affectionate. He started asking me about the party next weekend and plans for Valentine's day etc. We had a marathon later that evening where he was all affectionate again. I know he has a high libido and I love this about him, it's his way of communicating. This morning (Monday) he was ok, usually he's a little bit grumpy when he wakes up, he was fairly jovial but I could sense that he wanted me to leave, sort of ushering me out saying he didn't want me to be late for work etc. I'm assuming he just wanted to play more video games! He did say "see you later" which sort of curbed my paranoia to him turning round and saying "I never what to see you again".  Anyway, my question is, does this sound fairly familiar to those of you in a relationship with someone of bipolar? I spoke to my work colleague this morning who's partner is also bipolar and she pretty much said that this was typical, of being pushed away and then held tightly, pushed away and then held tightly again. I could tell in this mood he was purposely saying hurtful things and when he returned to what I know as normal (i.e. manic), he was being really sweet and affectionate again. Last week, when I told him I loved him. A few times he asked me, do you really? Why though? etc. I'm quite an aloof type person and feel quite guarded when it comes to my feelings, I'm affectionate but have problems with lovey exclamations.  All I can think of is he doesn't believe I love him a) because of my aloofness and b) because he doesn't think anyone could love him because he's this "bad person" Also the fact that, I may have been a bit too negative with him the past week i.e. overreacting and making him feel sh*t for forgetting to meet me as well as moaning a few times about him playing video games all day (when he's already feeling sh*t). He was trying to reject me in that moment despite all the wonderful moments we've had together. I'm guessing he felt that my negativity may mean me thinking about breaking up with him so decided to test me by pushing me away. It was better for him to reject me than for me to reject him.  I don't understand how he could do a 180 so rapidly going from not wanting to ever seen me again to thinking about what we'll be doing next weekend.  I want to communicate to him that I have never met or been with anyone with bipolar. I have little knowledge about it. I want to learn not because I find him a case study but because I love and care for him. I don't care if he's a "bad person" or a "loser" because I've seen enough good things to know not to take the "nastiness" to heart. We all have flaws and his disorder may mean he has more than the average person but I don't fall for people so easily and I have with him and want to make this work. I expect him to push me away at times, I can accept that he'll want space but I can't handle him saying that he'll never want to see me again when he thinks that's what's best for me. He said something quite vague and unclear after our discussion on Sunday, "Let's see how much resolve you have". I didn't know what he was referring to and didn't ask but I think he's referring to my being with him as before he's mentioned that "being with me is not easy". I certainly know it's a rollercoaster!  Also, how do you think I should take it from here? Should I attempt to meet him for a quick coffee on Thursday to see how he's doing? Or wait to meet on the weekend? I think it might be best to meet him on neutral gorund after this heavy weekend.  How do I communicate to him how I feel about him?  How do I handle a next mood? 
I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I started by going to my GP who listened to my condition and noticed that I had mood swings which went from being very depressed and tearful to being very extrovert and with a very sharp memory. I was refered to a consultant at a hospital and had an interview which lasted for 90 minutes. The consultant was very nice but found it a bit strange that I kept accurate notes of all my medical appointments. The problem is its worse than that I can remember all the formulas and equations that I learnt at school. I can even remember my first and second Barclaycard numbers. NHS number National insurance number, hospital number and health centre number. Need I say more. It is this sort of mental weirdness which indicates that you could be bipolar. The consultant said this is normally picked up by the time you are 21years old. Initally I was a bit worried but then I just accepted it and just watched my behaviour while I was out. If I feel depressed I just stay at home and eat a bit of dark chocolate and beetroot which seems to help. Have any of you discovered food which can help your mood swings. 
 This past November my husband was diagnosed with bipolar. We have been on a roller coaster ride since then. He has so many ups and downs and it's so scary. But the last couple days have been really bad. He comes home from work and is so down and out and I don't know how to help him. He is on lithium but I'm starting to think he might need something else with it also.  
Since I donât have bipolar disorder, Iâm wondering what itâs like being employed with the condition and if it is difficult to sustain a job. Has anyone had any positive or negative experiences with being hired and if so, how have others treated you during your working hours? Or maybe you havenât disclosed your mental illness for certain reasons? I apologise if I've asked a lot of questions...  I just want to understand from someone elseâs viewpoint.  
Tommorrow I search for a psychiatrist. Had a chat with my therapist and she is suggesting these frequent sensations could be mania...WHAT?   Spent the last year in therapy to help control my anxiety attacks with no medication. My therapist believes I have depression but also thinks other things could be contributing to it so she isn't really "diagnosing" depression.  I stopped attending in the last month because we agreed I had improved alot.  Last week I woke up very alert. I was awake but not myself. I was very aware something wasn't right but at the same time I had no emotion about anything and everything was like a dream I guess. Since then it's happened frequently, not everyday but alot to notice this ain't normal. It lasts for like 10-20min and I just snap out of it. Everything feels normal like it never happened.  I went to the Dr. And did a round of testing, which all came back normal. I decided then it has to be this anxiety crap and called up my therapist. I have some things to check up on but essentially I'm showing signs that I could be bipolar. 
I've been on Latuda for a little over a month. Anyone have any really bad side effects  
My now ex boyfriend is bipolar. I ended our relationship because he ended up cheating on me as well as abusing drugs, it started with weed and then cocaine and mdma. Me leaving him has finally been the wake up call for him to get help. I found out he wasnt taking his full dose of medication and also wasnt taking it all the time. I do still care alot for him so I am glad he is getting help now. I just want to know can a state of mania cause you to do crazy things like cheat? When you otherwise wouldn't have. Does bipolar cause you to do these things without really thinking about them? I new to learning about bipolar and just want to try to understand. 
The last couple of years I've been acting weird and I think I might be bipolar. How do you get checked, do you just go to the doctor or straight to a psychiatrist?  
So have been on lamotrogene and aririprazole for around 3 years now and still manic and low so now suggested i try lithium but so scared as i have an eating disorder and terrified of the weight gain horror stories ive heard  
I met my boyfriend a few months ago, he was kind, loveable, just amazing then changed overnight. He says he is ill, feels tired all the time, in pain, irritable, loves me too much, he's afraid of hurting me, so dumped me. He still needs me in his life but wants to go back to being friends and doing it all again. He has lost interest in his hobbies, work, people. He suffers from nightmares too. I really want to help him, I know he needs help. What do I do? 
The mental health services have failed me so much.i was told I had bipolar disorder by mental health nurse for months.then saw consultant and they said it was not.was just mood changes.the consultant was 20 minutes late for appointment.saw me for 35 minutes while clock watching and made her decision in 35 minutes.i then saw my mental health nurse and she said she had spoke to consultant.but consultant didn't remember me and cause of staff shortages on administration side.hadnt typed up my report.this was 2 and half weeks after consultation appointment.so she cudnt even remember what medication she suggested to me.i have had enough of there incompetence.i am in crisis.unless u have tried to commit suicide and ended up in hospital.there not as bothered.that is a fact.i need a second opinion.as I know there is something seriously wrong. 
No one to talk to.feel very sad.and don't want to go to work whilst going through treatment process.but people keep saying I should be in work even though I look after my young kids everyday taking them to nursery and school.football and swimming.i work hard at home and with kids.i have OCD.depression and a mood disorder.i struggle a lot.i just need someone to talk to like often who understands.sorry 
Hi all. I've suffered from depression and anxiety for many years. I've had 2 major mental breakdowns in the last 10 years. Both were bad. Back in may I didn't want to be here anymore. I can go from being 'happy' and crazy for many weeks then all of a sudden I'm at my lowest and end up not knowing what to do with myself. The mental health services where I am are rubbish. After seeing the crisis team I never got an appointment to see a psychiatrist and after months of waiting I told my gp they can go to hell for not helping me when I needed it. Fast forward to now I'm a complete mess and in the mood to walk far away from it all. I never do anything right in my life and I feel like a total failure. There is much more but you'd be here all day reading... stuck in a rut I can't get out of. When I'm high it's great,  I feel like a normal happy person. If only I could be like that every day.  
I lashed out at my daughter, age 12. I hurt her emotionally. I am sick with guilt. I read that emotional damage changes the way young minds develop. I have planted a lasting scar on her. 
My partner has bipolar , we have been together 20 months ! During this time he has ended the relationship several times when he is going through low moods.  Any advise on how to cope when he has low moods , bad days & very stressed periods .  I am doing my best to be understanding although this is not easy .  
Hello guys! I was only diagnosed with bipolar II a couple of weeks ago and it really came as a shock to me. I just started my 3rd week on lamotrigine, which is added to my Effexor which I have been on for about 3.5 years.  Besides a few side effects from the medicine, I feel like I'm floundering. I feel like I'm not really bipolar even though I fit the criteria for it. I don't think I have unipolar depression but I feel like, I don't know, I'm faking everything and no diagnosis fits what I have. Has anyone else felt like a faker before?   I would also like to start tracking my mood (which I have been told to do since this summer but alas, attention span and memory problems). I see my psychologist in 3 or 4 days but I'm really feeling like I'm going out of my mind right now. I don't have anyone to talk to about this in real life and I need help sorting my thoughts out a bit.   PS- anyone have weird visual effects on lamotrigine? Around once a day I get these weird visual "glitches" where things sort of shake around or get a little scrambled. They last under a second but they catch my eye. I'm also experiencing a little bit of anxiety and confusion as well as fatigue, but those are normal for me when I start new medicines.  
My boyfriend goes from Liturally showing me in love and affection to telling me he hates me and he wish I'd die.  The slightest think can trigger him but the majority of the time it comes from nowhere he will just be in that mood.  I'm currently off work with an ear infection and he has shown very little compassion ...in fact he didn't speak to me at all for an hour this morning when I got up ...There was no show of care.  What I don't get is he shows the kids love and affection it just seems me he is cold with.    We have got into arguments over nothing and it will result in him getting very agressive ...He wouldn't ever hit me but he is vile and extremely hurtfull things with his month. He has wished me dead, called me names, denied ever loving me. I cry cause I'm upset and he just tells me I'm pathetic. He doesn't show remorse until a few days later when he is loving and very sorry. The problem is he won't accept he has a problem and it's causing me to have depression and I just don't know what to say. When we are great we are fantastic but I'm constantly scared for the dip again as I know it's coming. I feel like I'm living on the edge. Please can anyone help me as I love him so much and we truly are soul mates. 
I was diagnosed bipolar in 2008, though it goes way back before then.  After a lot of prescriptions that did nothing, I eventually got 400 mg of quetiapine a day last year, and this has helped me to concentrate and so work, and also to sleep every night. This week, I ordered my monthly repeat prescription, but was told my GP would not authorize it until I made an appointment for an 'annual review'. After 2 days with no meds and no sleep, I eventually got the appointment made - it takes hours to get through to my surgery now, and you have to listen to horrible music and repeated messages for over an hour before anyone answers. I thought that the 'punishment' of withdrawn meds would be ended when I made the appointment as required, but my meds were still not at the pharmacy, so I called the surgery again, waited over an hour for a reply, and was told to call back because the doctor was busy. This has now gone on for 2 more days, and if I can get anyone to answer, they just tell me the doctor is busy but when he isnt busy they will ask him to authorize my monthly prescription again.  Now I havent slept for almost 4 days, I can't eat, and my head is racing with crazy weird thoughts. I'm so stressed out I am seriously thinking of going over to the rough part of town and buying some illegal drugs so that I can get some sleep ... WTF has happened to the NHS, how can they treat people like this? They know I can't sleep without the quetiapine which I am now dependent on. How can they cut off all your medicines because you hadn't made an appointment which they didnt tell you to make until they had stopped your prescription? Its now 4.30pm on Friday, and I have one hour left for the GP authorization to dispense my meds to arrive at my pharmacy ... if not, I have 2 more days going crazy with no sleep... looks like I am heading out for a drug dealer, at least they don't refuse to give you drugs because you failed to make some appointment you werent told about ... sorry for this rambling message, but my head is truly messed up; - how  can they treat people like this? 
I have been taking it for 7 days....getting some side effects and not feeling any better. I feel a bit strange actually!  Not with it! Is there anybody that can reassure me that this is all normal and it takes a while to feel better?  
Hi all  I'm having issues cause my meds are helping me but people think  drunk! My boss has had a go at me twice, I'm not sure what to say or do, I know I need to take my meds but I'm worried I'm giving the wrong impression? Can anyone help with suggestions? 
Case manager has had my report from Atos for 5 weeks now and have informed me that they have now written to the hospital that I have recently stayed at for 10 days if it was an nhs paid stay or a private hospital that I have paid for!! ( I played btw )Can anyone tell me if this is normal practice ? Does this mean a decision has been made and they are deciding how much to pay me ect ?  ...please help!! 
Ok I knowu condition isn't extreme, but I have generally had a good handle on it. This past year I haventhink which why I guess I have the two diagnosis and not one. My quetia pine answer citrslopes have doubled send lamatrogine has stayed the same. I am still having very erratic thoughts, my head is all over the place, one minute I'm fine and the next I am not or in some cases one day I'm fine and others I'm not, and that's a good day. Do I have suicidal thoughts probably not unless you classify thoughts of falling in front of a bus suicidal thoughts or wishful thinking or stupid, but I am at the end of my white,  all I want to do is have a normalise day and have the enthusiasm do do stuff instead of being robotic or just wanting to hibernate because I feel that number and void. Don't know how to deal with this !!! ������� 
" At times being bipolar can be an all consuming challenge, requiring stamina and even more courage, so if you are living with this illness and still functioning, it is something to be proud of, not ashamed of. "  Carrie Fisher   
My partner has bipolar & we have been together for two years. During this time he has ended the relationship 4/5 times as he gets an idea in his head then switches of from me . I have done much research to enable me to try my best to understand his condition & cope with this relationship !  What I would like to know is even with a mental health condition are you able to love , genuinely care & have real feelings for the opposite sex ?  Can anyone tell me about their relationship s as this may help me to decide if I have any kind of future with him as sometimes I feal I'm treated unfairly!   
Hi All,  Tonight is my first night in taking Lithium and i am extrmeemly nervous and anxious about the side effects i may suffer. I know not everyone experieces the same side effects but what was everyones first night like? how did they feel, did it affect there sleep etc ?   Kind Regards 
I have a question whether anyone else has experienced this.  Of course hypersexuality is all potential symptom of being bipolar which I experience quite a bit. My partner and I don't have sex, which is from his lack of sex drive. It makes it difficult but I've learnt not to push too hard.  I've noticed over time that if I release in anyway, whether by myself or with someone else, it causes me to start functioning lower.  If I resist the urge for several days I function better, can wake up easier and prevent over sleeping (which makes me a monster) and generally have more energy throughout the day.  However as soon as I do release my energy immediately depletes and I start to function lower.  Sometimes if I am having a difficult time controlling it this sends me to days and days of low energy which I would Have otherwise been fine.   I find it incredibly frustrating because from what I've observed in order to maintain my mood I have to almost completely abstain. I've already given up so much I enjoy to manage my mental state and wish this wasn't a problem.  Anyone else.experienced this? Any tips? 
I am on a dilema about continue with my disability benefits and a part time job or get a full time job.  I spent less than a year a different full time jobs before I get sick.  One job offered me to go from full time to part time but I left the job because I was embarrased and angry about my behavior and other behaviors.  Plus I was still not feeling good after being at the hospital for a week.  When I am sick I am like a retard I cant add two plus two. I am an Accountant.  THe 3rd job I had in Maine full time, I quit after I left my exhusband. At this job they saw I was sick and they gave me a chance to to stay but I quit.  It seems that after I work full time I get sick.  ! lost 4 jobs this way. THe last job I was in the hospital 3 times that year,  I do not know If I can work after being in the hospital because I never went back.  Last year I work part time 16 hrs for 3 months, I do not know If I will be ok if I work part time because this is my only experience I have had part time  Now I am going to start working part time taking care of my mom for 24 hours.  The thing is that I owe a lot of money and I do not make to much.  Disability money plus the limited amount they request a month.  THis is the reason why I want to know if you think I should work full time or I should stay as now.  It seems that I get sick every two years.  I have been sick one year 2010 without work but I was able to manage to be at home.  Other time I have been at the hospital.  What have been yoour experience?  Has anybody gone thru this too?  What are you doing for work? 
I was in a full blown manic episode from age 16 and a half till a few days before I turned 18. Here is the whole story.  I was 15 and a freshman, sitting 1:1 with a teacher during lunch period. I was supposed to be finishing work, but I felt pressure to chat with the teacher. My brain wanted me to chat. She reminded me to do her work. Than sophomore year started and I was talking about sex in school a lot. CPS was called and my mom was blamed for the behavior. My mom shouldn't be blamed for behavior that is a result of a mental illness, but hey. Then at the end of sophomore year I did something stupid. I drew 9/11 on a state test and was hospitalized. The hospital just let me go and told me not to do this again. The math question was about blocks in a bin and I made a joke. I was laughing but they weren't. During the summer of that year I had a lot of big ideas. One of them was to invent a real portal like the ones you see on the children's TV show cyber chase. Another idea was to invent a google earth video (kinda like google earth, except you can watch anything live). I literally thought I was going to become a scientist and invent these things.  2 months into my junior year I read an article online and was suddenly very happy. When I spoke I switched from one topic to another easily. I even pointed this out to my math teacher "I can switch from one topic to another easily". I thought I was going to become the next MLK, the president in 10 years. I thought everyone in America was going to change the constitution for me while I gave a speech in front of a big audience (like MLK did). I was very hyper, energetic and easily distracted, kinda like ADHD. In math class, I wanted to talk to my classmate as I was distracted and felt pressure to talk. In gym when we had a substitute I wanted to walk and jump around instead of sit still and talk to my classmates. I was happy all the time. My school had airport style scanning and there was this one security guard at the entrance who described me as "this one is always laughing and smiling". These were her exact words. She said a few times I was always laughing. I also thought I was smarter than I really was, at unrealistic levels. This is formally called "inflated self-esteem or grandiosity".  I intentionally failed my classes because I thought I was going to win the lottery and become the president or really famous. I did other dumb stuff too. I thought I was invincible to the consequences as my special connection to god and god would protect me from the consequences. I thought god put me here for a special purpose.  I spent money on lottery tickets (always with my mom since I was <18 but then she wouldn't let me). I spent money on countless useless things. I thought I was going to win and use the money to make myself famous. I had a plan to buy the organization I used to go to many years ago and turn it into my agenda. I went to a fortune teller (who solicited me on the street) and asked what college will I go to. She said Harvard. I literally thought I was going to Harvard.  I would also get angry for no reason, mainly at home. I would pace back and forth, taking it out on my mom. I thought my parents were against me, so I never told them my plans. One time I told my sister I was going to become famous. She said she will kill me if I become famous. I told my mom my sister threatened me and she did nothing. I had an argument with my mom over this. I was 17.  A few days before I turned 18, there was a "breaking point" where I realized all the stuff I believed (such as becoming the next MLK or winning the lottery) weren't true. I was devastated that I failed every class. I was really stressed out that I failed my classes, embarrassed myself, etc. At lunch I talked to a girl about being stressed, what she does to cope, etc. I had no idea I was going through the depressive part of a manic episode. I thought what I went through was just a teenage thing, but I had a sister who was 2 years younger and didn't go through this. I went to summer school during my senior year and thank god I graduated on time. I had never been hospitalized for this manic episode. I started college in the spring, but I think I was lucky to be there considering what I've been through. Sometime after starting college, I was reading the symptoms of a manic episode on WebMD and I realized that I've been through.  So today I am 20 and will turn 21 in March. I never had a manic/hypomanic/mixed episode since this one. I guess I'm lucky that it is only one full blown manic episode and I never had to deal with the trauma of being hospitalized. 
I have recently been diagnosed with bipolar 2. I also have major depression and severe panic and anxiety disorder. The have me on lamotrigine,buspar,ativan,and recently added lithium, but I am not sure lithium is for me

I finally went to see my gp last week to discuss my mood swings...my change in personality....and have been referred to a psychiatric department to be assessed for bipolar....I'm scared and anxious... 
Its a vicious circle, meds to increase to help my cyclothmia and mixed episodes, they have taken a turn in the wrong direction on top of that I have bulimia (recovering if you ever do). In 1 week of the Quetiapine  being upped from 75mg to 150mg and citralopram being upped from 20mg to 30mg, thankfully 200mg lamotragine has stayed the same, I have put on 8lbs. I'm bloated, uncomfortable and it's making the lows even lower and affecting how I act. I am literally crying myself to sleep, and self harm is even stronger. I know there are people who say weigh it up, which is better, but when you have an eating disorder putting on weight is a huge no!, please please how can I change this, can I take something to counteract the weight gain or another medicine. I'm struggling and to the point of stopping the meds!!!!! ���� 
I am looking for help. I have been on 400mg of lithium for nearly 4 weeks. i am having terrible stomach pains and aching legs. Yesterday the pains were excrutiating in my stomach worse than labour pains. I felt like i wanted to die and feel the same today. can anyone help will this get better? my down periods are awful i feel worse than when i wasn't taking anything. Please help any suggestions would be welcomed as i am beside myself, wish i had the guts to kill myself but i dont. how pathetic is that.  
I've been diagnosed with BPD, but somehow it does not seem to 'fit', or tell the whole story and I wonder whether it is possible for Bipolar to be masked by another diagnosis. I understand sometimes it can work out the other way around, in that someone is diagnosed with Bipolar when actually they have a personality disorder. I think in my case the opposite is true, or I have both, is that possible? I also have reaccuring bouts of depression and take both anti-depressants and two types of anti-psychotics and really struggle to put my finger on what is wrong. Something so clearly is not right, yet the current diagnosis somewhow don't seem to fully fit symptoms. I have lows, which repeat at rate of 5:1 and the highs are not that high, as in I haven't ever been so manic, that I would have completly lost touch with reality. I also experience psychotic symptoms, but these have not been tought to warrant a fully blown psychotic episode label. I'm thorougly lost and feel that I'm not getting the most effective care, due to only partial diagnosis. Any advice?  
A little background before my questions. My boyfriend was diagnosed with bipolar when he was young. He didn't like the medications so went to therapy instead and learned skills to deal with it. In our 12 year relationship, we broke up twice..once for a few days and another for like 3 months. We recently moved to a different city so he can go to the college he wanted. We live with my sister to save money even though I didn't care to. I didn't want to live with other people, I wanted just us. It took me awhile to find a new job in the new city but I finally did. We are struggling still financially. He start acting different recently. He said he felt weird and need space. So i gave him space and he push me away more. He gets aggitated with me easily now and doesn't say he love me anymore like he used to. He is secretive with his phone. I been the jealous type before but try not to anymore. He does talk to a female friend in another country a lot lately. He also planning to study aboard where she lives. I was able to do some detective work and found out they are dating, he had confess his love to her in an email. I haven't confront him about it. He is suppose to go to counseling in a couple weeks to talk to someone about his weird feelings. Is bipolar related to cheating? I know it's not physical since she is in a different country but emotional cheating. Ia this because of his bipolar or is he over me? 
hello everyone   i feel that i have time when i'm good mood   and other time when i'm low and depressed    maybe six mounts in year be good and other not    is that mean bipolar  or season depression ?

Can it be possible to be diagnosed with bi polar disorder and narcissism or narcissistic traits?????? 
Where to begin.. I've suffered with anxiety for as long as I can remember, and intrusive thoughts in periods.  I didn't have my first depressed episode until I was probably 19.  After about two years of just constantly feeling blue and one WICKED panic attack, I finally agreed to get help via medication.  My depressed episode was not the lay in bed all day type, more of I could go out with friends and put on a smile but was generally just sad and knew I could get more out of life.  Couple that with anxiety and it can make for a hell of a way to live.  So I started Citalopram(Celexa) and had basically no side effects, and when I finally reached a dose that worked for me, it saved my life.  Anxiety, depression, intrusive thoughts, ALL gone.  After about 6 months of finally having clarity, I thought I was fully better and quit cold turkey.  Besides brain zaps I felt pretty good for about a year or so.  Then I noticed my depression start to slide again.  I wanted to nip it in the bud so I started Celexa again.  The NP I saw said the same SSRI sometimes doesn't work again the second time around.  It made me feel terrible.  Shooting out of bed every 2 hours, increased angst, agitation, certain nights I'd wake up and imagine that's how it must've felt to take designer drugs.  Was taken off that asap and started Prozac 10mg.  After 3 1/2 weeks my depression was getting better but anxiety was getting worse.  My caffeine tolerance went way down and a cup or two made me feel like I was on speed some days.  So I saw the same NP and said it might have just been too stimulating but she had a slight concern.  I had two times since I'd started where I got very internally agitated, more so than before when I was on the meds.  The only thing that stopped it both times was a .5 of Xanax.  Racing thoughts, just generally p*ssed off.  I didn't act out whatsoever and probably seemed completely normal on the outside, but was agitated 8/10 on the inside.  She said that there was a slight concern for BP but it was strange I'd done so well the first time id taken a Anti depressant.  So she prescribed me Lexapro and told me to watch my mood to see how I feel.  A low dose, 5 mg to start.  I'm 6 days in and I have my moments of calm but today I woke from a nap and every sound seemed to just annoy me (dog licking itself, etc.) lasts about 20 minutes of this agitation and slowly wears off but lingers in intensity.  I'm starting to really question myself. I have a history of being a worry wart and convincing myself I have such and such when I get sick.  I mentioned the BP to my Pdoc and he seemed to brush it off and want to talk about my anxiety.  It's like since she said BP I can't seem to get it off my mind.  With my history of ruminating I've spent a good few hours online since looking into the various differences between BP states and where it varies with anxiety and unipolar depression.  I'm just confused on what's going on.  All the online tests I take said I have very little chance of BP and a high anxiety disorder chance.  But I wonder why I all of the sudden get these random agitated moments since starting ADs this time.  I don't have any of the euphoric highs, etc. and my sleep is pretty erratic (bartending schedule) but I generally sleep every night.  Reading into the BP2 curriculum confuses me a ton where the line is, or if I'm just anxious out of my mind and overthinking (but then again anxiety and depression seem to go along with BP2). Agghhh what is it?! I'm the only one in my family that has these issues.  I just want to feel better.  Can anyone help?  It would be much appreciated. 
Hello, just after some advice my partner has just left me again for the 6th time, over the last year he has suffered with depression , he drinks lots too, he left me and our little girl in June for another women but begged for me back about 6 Weeks ago, we began to trust each other again live each other our family was great he was happy so I thought then every so often he just ignores me won't let me near him won't talk to me then the next day will be loving, I found out the other day he was messaging he same girl again I confronted him and he didn't argue just left said he can't control himself and he wants to kill no self and iv heard nothing from him only the day before we went for a beautiful meal went to the movies and now he's gone.

Hi  I've always been considered a person who has had mood swings. However the mood swings have become bad the past two years or so to a point where it's interfering with my job and life. I go through episodes where I become sad, problems concentrating, depressed, fatigue or low energy, feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, or guilt, unmotivated, crying, not wanting to be around people, racing thoughts, feeling rubbish about the future, can't be bothered and I literally want to stay in bed and do nothing. Sometimes these depressed moods last a few days. Other times is lasts a few hours.  So i do also have moods where I feel good and happy, I'm hyperactive, I have all these ideas about what I want to do with the future, increase in talking, increase optimism, increase in sex drive, extremely high self-esteem and have more energy that I normally do. I'm also very irritable on times and can become angry over the smallest thing. I decide I want to do things and then I completely change my mind. I was originally diagnosed with anxiety a few years ago as I was worrying a lot. I also have normal days where I feel normal and my mood is consistent for a few days but then the depressed mood seems to come back again with the odd happy mood in between.  My mood can also change throughout the day as well for example I can wake up depressed, by lunch time I'm normalish and my evening I can be hyperactive. I was able to manage my moods however about three months ago they seemed to of got worse. I felt more depressed than usual but the depression would only last a few days or even a few hours. My thoughts have been racing more than often and It got to the point where I walked out of my job due to not being able to cope.  I've been to the doctor about two months ago and broke down crying and was put on anti depressants which are not stopping me from feeling low and depressed. On these anti depressants my moods are exactly the same. Although I've been more hyperactive and the depessed moods are just as bad. I've contacted my doctor today and told me I may have Cyclothymia.  I was wondering if anyone has had any exprience of this? or thinks that this sounds like Cyclothymia? 
I've been with my husband for 16 years.. since I was 17 I'm not 33.. we've never been 100% happy. Life happened got pregnant young had another baby at 21 just fell into a routine and we've been together ever since.. I suffer from bipolar and severe depression and I am medicated thru my dr.. he suffers from depression and is untreated.. the past couple months things have drastically went down hill with u him and I. We do nothing but fight and argue. I understand all husbands and wives argue but it's to the point that it's a daily routine. I'm constantly being accused of cheating.. I'll admit there for a while I Antes to find someone else and was on plenty of fish. Wanted to leave.. he forgave me(so he says.. still gets thrown in my face) we moved on and tried to be happy but it never works.. we might go a few weeks without fighting but then when one little argument happens it is blown  in a big ordeal.. I just want it all to stop. I feel like my life is worthless.. I've been talking to a guy friend that is a friend to both me and my husband and because I don't let him read every little thing this guy and I talk about I'm cheating. Last night a fight started my daughter told him I was talking to this guy and deleting messages I freaked out on her and broke her phone. In the process of breaking her phone with a wrench she hit the wrench and I now have a goose egg above my eye. I apparently broke our bedroom tv also.. I don't remember do this.. my husband then told me he was taking the kids this am and filing an order ofor protection against me and telling the police I threatened to hit my daughter with this wrench.. so in trying to save my marriage I've deleted Facebook and trying to make this work.. but the thought of just ending my life is there continually nagging at me. Just hit a tree going as fast as I can or just swallow a bottle of pills or put the car in the garage and leave the car running.. I don't know what to do! I know I need help but I'm afraid that if I seek the help I do need that he will use it against me and take my girls cause he's told me he'd do that before.. can anyone help?! 
With my manic episodes, I feel like I'm in a constant cycle of having my life destroyed and having to start all over again. Does anyone else feel like this? Has anyone ever done or said anything whilst they've been unwell that has caused damage beyond repair? Over Christmas I had an episode where I ended up writing horrible things on social media about my partner and now his Mom refuses to see me and won't have anything to do with me, despite knowing I was unwell at the time. It's ruined my life and I don't know what I can do to make things better. It makes me feel sick and like I don't want to be here anymore. Will things ever improve and can I trust people to develop a level of understanding and compassion?  
I'm new here, actually found it by accident. I have BPD with severe self harm, Bipolar Disorder 2 and anxiety. I have been going to therapy/Pdr. for 10+ years but nothing seems to be working. TRIGGER:                I feel like crap, I want/don't want to cut. I want to fill an empty syringe with air and just inject it. I so sick and tired of feeling like this. I'm nobody, just a big mistake, I have nor will I ever make a mark on this world. Yes I know my "family" will be upset, because it looks good for them but I know secretly be happy/relieved. The thoughts just keep pushing at me to kill myself and get it over with. I want to, I want this over. I'm tired of fighting a losing battle ever step I get forward I'm dragged 4 back.   
The fall and winter are bad times for me.  I'm growing more depressed and irritable as the weather gets colder and the days get shorter.  I know that I need to keep a regular routine but I can't seem to form one for this time of year.   
I'm really unsure about posting here and I feel really lost but I'm hoping someone can help. I've been experiencing episodes of mania and depression and its truly ruining my life. I've had numerous episodes these past couple of weeks and almost broke my hand punching a cement wall. I don't know how to control myself and my moods and I go for short periods of time days or even weeks of elated mood then just outta nowhere crashing depression and I feel so lost and confused. Other times I'm so happy I just do whatever I want no matter how dangerous or the consequences and it led to me becoming addicted to opiates and benzos. I feel like no one can help me and getting professional help isn't an option for me so I'm just looking for ways to cope and I just wanna know if anyone else has experienced similar things?  
Is it true with bipolar your low mood will last at least a day or two or maybe a week before it changes to a high mood? As my sons moods are not like this For Example My son has low moods, high moods, depressive moods and aggressive moods but they are daily, and for a while every day âHe can be down and moody in the morning, lunchtime he is ok, quite normal, by late afternoon he is abrupt and agressive in his speech and in the evening quite spaced out like he is not quite here. âAlso his moods can change rapidly during a conversation from relaxed and conversational to snappy and argumentative âWhen speaking to him sometimes if you dont agree with something he says or he doesnt agree with something you say he can get right up into your face  He has always been very mature and responsible for his age but now sometimes he can get exciteable and silly over nothing just like a small child does âSometimes his speech is quite fast and the wiords seem to roll into each other and other times his speech can be slow, delayed and he sometimes has a stutter.

Hi all  Has anyone on seoquel/ quetiapine suffered from frequent urination. I have overactive bladder syndrome as well and even had a operation for it. I use to go every half a hour. It is better now and my days are better than nights. One of the meds I am taking for Bipolar is seroquel at night. And after eliminating everything else it seems that the seroquel might be the cause of it. Which makes me very angry as I had my bladder problem for like forever and bipolar for about 15 years. All the necessary dr's knew about both problems, yet no one told me that seroquel can cause frequent urination. Waking up every hour at night drives me insane and really puts a damper on my mood. I would be glad to know if there is anyone else suffering from this because then I am just going to cut the seroquel out and increase my epilim.  Thanks guys and have a beautiful day. 
Does anyone on here who has bipolar disorder at times find that their thoughts and statements come out in rhymes?  This is an example of what my mind does when it gets this crazy rhyming buzz. I got diagnosed with BD about eight years back, and the rhyming's getting worse and I think I'm going to crack. It's a compulsion that is messing with my mind, and my posts are often deleted because they think I'm being unkind. Its no joke

Anyone out there in australia?? 
Hello everyone.  I am 16 years of age and have been suffering with many of the bipolar two symptoms for just under a year. I am finally going to my GP tomorrow after it's gotten out of control. I've heard it's very difficult to get a correct diagnosis and help as the doctor usually diagnoses you with depression. Obviously intend of explaining both my hyper symptoms and depression ones but I'm nervous I won't get the help I need. I've been diagnosed with depression before so I know what that's like and this is the same, but added with many different symptoms like, extreme happiness, lots of ideas and racing thoughts, a lot of self esteem, distractibility, irritable, wanting to get lots of things done and having a good conversation with somebody. I have tried counselling, CBT, writing and nothing holistically seems to work. I just hope my GP understands. Anyone got any tips? Thanks  
I was hoping for some straight forward information on bipolar âIve googled it and looked on a few websites but i dont feel they really explain the illness in detail especially to someone who doesnt really know anything about it  âMy son is 18yrs old Several years ago he was self harming, eating disorder and suffered with anxiety and panic attacks âHe has been doing really well he has stopped self harming and sorted out his eating, the anxiety is still there but nothing like it was but recently his behaviour has changed and quite dramatically too âHis behaviour and moods are very irratic daily and  throughout the whole day He is very snappy and irrational alot of the time âHis mood can chasnge several times during a conversation - excited, happy to moody, argumentative to irrational and like in a depressive state âEverything has to be his way, if youy dont agree with him he goes off in a mood, if you dont like the same music or films as him he can get irritated and talks to you with nan aggressive tone âThings have to be now for example if he askedyou to pass the tv control and you havent done it as soon as he has stopped talking he will get up and come over and snatch it off of you I have 2 younger son, 15 and 9 and he is not very nice to them especially the youngest one as he is very abrupt with him and verbally pushes him around and  can sometimes get physical - last week he pinned him to the wall by his throat âI no longer really feel comfortable leaving them home alone together, i alway feel i need to be watching him waiting for his mood to change â|My older son is bigger so he can look out for himself a bit more than my younger son can I really dont know what to do â    
Well my gp and psychotherpist think i have a form of Bipolar.  The psyhciatrist i have only seen once, and she wants to take her time with a diagnosis, so i am filling in a mood diary for her.  Myself im not sure what to think, but filling in the mood diary has shown me a bit of a pattern.  It seems my "normal" way of being is really quite depressed, not extreme but bad enough that i havent felt anything positive in quite some time, life generally i have to say really is not pleasant.  Then things change, im more focused on work, i have loads of great ideas.  Distressingly though i feel my attitude to other people is just terrible.  Everyone is stupid and beneath me, they dont matter and their problems or opinions make me angry.  I would say the depression at these times is definatly less, and i sleep less, eat less and just care less about everyone but me.  This seems to last about 4-5 days, then i feel the depression creeping back in.  Does this seem to everyone to be enough for my gp and therapist to be right about a concern about bipoalr 2?  Im just not sure.  These patterns really have been going on for a lot of years, at least 10-15 and ive always just put it down to anxiety, but its sure not improving - worsening if anything 
Hi all I am 18 and 5 and after weeks after a right hip replacement. Since October I've been having weird moods, like happy then I just want to kick the f*** out people, there's times I am pure happy then so down and I don't know why?.    Could that be bipolar or?    Megan's x 
I lived a very happening life till my early 20âs; had many friends, was fairly good at studies, had fun travelling around, was active in sports etc. During this time period when I was 22 I had a change of heart and started reading books on religion which had a profound affect on my thinking. I quickly embraced my new found enlightenment and changed my life style, now becoming more religious and tried to do my best to be good member of society.  Everything was coming along very smoothly in this transition that I was going through and managed to even improve my grades at my university; which was very uplifting for me. One of those nights while I went to bed to sleep I started hearing a voice. It was a continuous flow of the word âJinnâ and it kept on resonating in my ears. Initially I thought for the first few hours that it was nothing but my imagination but gradually the voice became louder and more audible. I after failing to sleep for a few hours went to my fatherâs room and requested him to let me sleep with him. Well, that didnât help me much either and I stayed awake till the morning light gradually entered the room. It was a horrific night I was in utter discontent and was highly fearful of where the voice was coming from. When my father woke up I told him about my situation and he said that he will check with doctors to know what was wrong with me.  Unfortunately the voice was getting louder and I started having instructions from the voice to do certain acts. I couldnât control myself and gradually began following the instructional messages I was receiving in my head. These instructional messages lasted for roughly 14 days in which I could not even manage to sleep for a few hours at best. In addition I was sensing a strong heat wave in my body during this period. I thought that maybe I had been bewitched and some devil was after me.  After 2 odd weeks my parents started feeding me some medication after which the voices subsided and so did the heat wave in my body. It was a very difficult time period for me and I started feeling that maybe I was a bad person because of which all of this happened to me. This problem persisted at lower intensity for 6 years and I was fully convinced that this was some issue of magic which had been done on me and that medication was not the solution. I was even hostile towards medication and the concept of counselling. Despite this I grudgingly managed to visit a psychologist for a few months who informed me that I had Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I didnât agree with the counselors advice as the symptoms that I was experiencing and the characteristics of the defined disease did not match.  Fast forward 6 years. After going through a rough patch in which I lost my job I was under a lot of stress. A place where I was working part time I started hearing a sound again. This time it was not as aggressive or difficult to bare but it was like 6 years back instructional in nature. I once again started following these instructions but this time the consequences of my actions was even bigger than what transpired 6 years back. Following these instructional voices that I heard I twice created a huge scene in my locality by trying to run away from home. It was a very difficult time period for me and all those connected to me. This time though the outcome was thankfully much different.  I was shifted to a psychiatric center where I was kept in doors for a 3 month time period. During this time period they gradually inculcated in me the idea of disease concept in me. Finally my worries were over and I felt a liberated person; they informed me I had bipolar disorder. To there utter surprise I was not going through any depression that I had a psychiatric illness which might require medication for the rest of my life. For me the opportunity of finally knowing what difficulty I was suffering was a gift in it self. Now that I knew the problem I faced tackling and management would not be that difficult.  Itâs been nearly 7 months since I have continued with my normal life routine. Itâs quite simple for those who know they have the same disease as I do or for those who feel they might have it. Firstly you need to have a strong faith set that whatever transpired in your lives and whatever you went through was on the basis of the Infinite Wisdom of GOD. HE has created this world to go through test and trial and through patience and prayer you can overcome all the tests that come your way. Secondly you need to be sure that if you do have psychiatric illness like bipolar disorder you need to accept it gracefully and not start whining that why me why me?? Instead you need to be solution focused. For starters go see a counselors and discuss with them your symptoms and how you hope to over come your problems. In addition you need not feel that having a disease like bipolar is a stigma. Rest assured those people who are close to you they will support you and those who wish to make fun of you they donât matter in reality because they arenât your well wishers. Thirdly psychiatric diseases require medication to equate the chemical imbalance inside you. So donât take medication as a threat to your life it will only help you to stay stable. These are some of the core principles which will help you stay on the front foot in your fight against bipolar.  In addition there are many management techniques which will help you overcome your situation. Firstly you need to be aware of which state you are going through. Is it mania, heightened energy levels or depression. You can only solve a problem when you know what the actual problem is. So work on mindfulness. Go google articles of mindfulness when your aware of your state it will be easier to communicate with your counselor and explain your situation. Secondly in psychiatric disease management it is very important to know about positive thinking. Make it a habit to look at the positive side of every situation this will keep you up and about. Thirdly you need to resolute in your determination and whenever you feel you have slipped gather enough energy and resilience to get back up again. And last but not the least you need to walk regularly. Like 3 times for 20 minutes each. When you walk endorphins release in your body which create positive vibes and are positive for your mental health. This will hopefully provide you with a tool to keep positive throughout the day.  So I would like conclude by saying that my experience of going through successive manic episodes and depression phases for 6 years was very tough especially as I was not diagnosed with the correct disease for this time period. But I would like to motivate you all who suffer from this disorder and feel that they can never live a normal and healthy life that your not spot on. You can!!!! All you need to do is to discover your self and follow the advice of your counselors. Eventually you will see a lot of benefits of this test that your facing. Keep the faith strong!!! 
I have been taking lithium carbonate for nearly eight years. I have recently had my meds upped to 1000mg at night. I am not bi-polar but suffer from severe recurrent depression. I would like to know the effects both reversal and irreversible of long term lithium use? I have regular blood tests where thyroid and liver function are checked. Thankyou. 
For the past month and a half or so my mother (who is bipolar) has been showing strange symptons and acting extremely different. She sometimes laughs hysterically to herself and often shouts to herself or out of the window to people she believes are "provoking her", i have not seen or heard any of these people. I confronted her about doing this today and she said she thought i couldn't hear her, because i "had headphones on" (which i didnt). She always ask's me about the occupation of my friends fathers (never the mother) which is likely linked to the fact that my father who recently passed away was unemployed, and also an alcoholic, it's with this that she shows a clear grudge against all men, saying she "hates most". She's never been suicidal but has been hospitalized due to a severe break down but this was most recently over 10 years ago.  I often tell her there's no-one there, and that she's talking to herself and that she needs to get help, this is often done with an angry tone (this is not to be malicious, I suffer from some anger issues). I have no idea how to calm her down or how to stop her from shouting out of the window at no-one.  In addition, she always says how she hates the area we live in, this is often what she shouts about.  There was also once a time where we got onto a bus and she just stopped walking and stared at a mother and her son on the bus, giving them a dirty look.  I spend alot of time away from home (regularly staying at friends houses over the weekend, and school/revision on weekdays) and she expresses her concern whenever i'm at someones house, even if i've been to said persons house countless times. This is ALWAYS because of the father. When I was going to see a friend, she didn't allow me to go due to the ethnicity of my friends father, and she thought it was "suspicious" that his mother had died during childbirth. which brings me on to my final point that she is always suspicious and always think's that people are out to get her. At one point there were some teenagers outside our house and she believed they deliberately chose to be there and were almost targetting her.  I'm only 16 and have no idea what to do, how can I help my mother? I've tried to tell her to call someone or get help but she refuses it and insists she's fine.  Thank you for any input/help you may be able to offer. 
They threw me off, permanently.  I'm so Sad   I'm crying.  â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ 
Since I first started showing signs of bipolar, when I was in hgih school, my mood changes length would change constantly and still do to this day. For example, on Tuesday, I was suicidal and at rock bottom but then the next day I felt okay again, no hundred per cent but okay. However, I get periods where my moods will last weeks or a month. Is this normal of bipolar? 
Some time ago I was diagnosed with Cyclothymia which is a milder form of bi-polar.   On those down days, my grown, adult, kids just don't "get it."   In fact they won't even listen to anything about it.   I've tried on numerous occasions, but they immediately change the subject.   My mother was an alcoholic which was her way of self-medicating bi-polar.   I want my kids to be patient, kind, and accepting when I just want to stay home, read, take a nap, etc.   But, instead they try to convince me to "oh come with us Mom ... it'l be fun,"   They just don't get it and I am totally frustrated with them.   They will not hear anything about it. Thanks for any input. Barb 
I weaned off my Zoloft and Lamictal, but the Lamictal is still causing me quite a bit of nasty physical side effects (I was taking 200mg). Before anyone asks, I weaned as slowly as I could - insurance was discontinued. I did so over the process of about 5 weeks.  Does anyone have recommendations for natural remedies? Here are the worst side effects I am experiencing:  Dizziness: By far the worst symptom I am experiencing. Daily, continuously to the point where I have to take breaks from walking and lay down (when sitting at computer).  Fatigue: Especially by the afternoon. I am taking multivitamin with vitamin D already but doesn't seem to be helping. My energy is drained and I am having trouble with regular tasks.  Nausia/wanting to vomit and balance: Especially when the diziness get's strong.  Also, I do not want to consider getting the medication again (even through the clinics at a discounted price). Frankly, this stuff has scared the crap out of me so if you can please just offer natural remedies for my current side effects, I would be super grateful.  Thanks everyone for your time! 
Seems to be all negatives  There must be some plus points  Perhaps when we are feeling MANIC ?  All the creative brilliance that you can read about which is common with bipolar  Maybe you've made new friends ?  Or tried something different ?  THERE MUST BE SOME POSITIVES    
I feel myself becoming more manic everyday. I have so many thoughts and ideas racing in my head but luckily I have been able to resist acting on them. I haven't been able to control my behavior though. My mood swings are severe and extremely unpredictable and I have made a lot of bad decisions lately. I am so afraid I'm going to lose complete control and act on my thoughts and ideas which would be catastrophic. The fear has caused multiple episodes of panic attacks. Does any one know of ways to gain control again? 
Does anyne know what the law is on this subject please. I mean specifically, in the UK. Thank you all  Marish X 
Hi all,  I am in a bad way.  Have disengaged from ALL psyciatric and GP attention.  Have refused to take Lithium.  They have, in return, stopped ALL my anti depressants. They have not explained, but from looking it up, and listening on Forums, i think it's because Venaflaxin fuels Mania.  So, I am seeing the GP on Thursday, in response to my complaint, i can not cope with the withdrawal from the Venaflaxine (150mg).  Is ther an alternate anti depressant, one that does not fuel Mania ?  Please help with advice.  I do not need to be told what an IDIOT I am being, I already know.  No negative comments please, I cannot deal with any at present.  Thanks you.  Please see reference below, sorry to be so long winded.   Taking certain antidepressants for depression is linked to a heightened risk of subsequent mania and bipolar disorder, reveals research published in the online journal BMJ Open.  The strongest association seemed to be for serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs for short, and the dual action antidepressant venlafaxine, the analysis indicated.  The researchers base their findings on the anonymised medical records of more than 21,000 adults in receipt of treatment for major (unipolar) depression between 2006 and 2013 at a large provider of inpatient and community mental healthcare in London.  The research team looked at subsequent diagnoses of bipolar disorder or mania following an original diagnosis of unipolar depression, so-called because it lacks the 'highs' typical of bipolar disorder.  The analysis revealed that the overall yearly risk of a new diagnosis of mania and bipolar disorder between 2006 and 2013 was 1.1% (10.9/1000 patient years).  The peak age for diagnosis was seen among patients aged 26 to 35, among whom the yearly risk was 1.2% (12.3/1000 patient years).  The most commonly prescribed antidepressants were SSRIs (35.5%); mirtazapine (9.4%); venlafaxine (5.6%) and tricyclics (4.7%).  Previous treatment with certain antidepressants was associated with a heightened risk of a subsequent diagnosis of bipolar disorder and/or mania, the yearly risk of which ranged from 1.3% to 1.9% (13.1 to 19.1/1000 patient years).  Further analysis revealed that this heightened risk was particularly associated with treatment with SSRIs and venlafaxine. These drugs were associated with a 34-35% increased risk of being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and/or mania.  These findings held true even after taking account of potentially influential factors.  This is an observational study so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, and the researchers point out that their findings may be explained by latent bipolar disorder rather than any effects of drug treatment. Furthermore, they were unable to obtain information on important risk factors.  "However, regardless of underlying diagnosis or aetiology the association of antidepressant therapy with mania demonstrated in the present and previous studies highlights the importance of considering whether an individual who presents with depression could be at high risk of future episodes of mania," say the researchers.  Pertinent risk factors include a family history of bipolar disorder, a depressive episode with psychotic symptoms, young age at first diagnosis of depression, and depression that is unresponsive to treatment.  "Our findings also highlight an ongoing need to develop better ways to predict future risk of mania in people with no prior history of bipolar disorder who present with an episode of depression," they write.  In an accompanying videocast, the researchers highlight that the absolute risk of developing bipolar disorder is low and antidepressants are safe and effective treatments for depression and anxiety. Patients should not stop their treatment suddenly as this may result in withdrawal symptoms, they advise.

Hello all fellow bp sufferers and relatives, friends. I am on Quetiapine 150mg and just started Lithium (400mg) 10 days ago as no benefit from Quet. apart form a 4-5 month rally when on 100mg. To put in contetext, I was diagnosed BP1 March 15 after a 4 month manic episode. I was put on 100mg which seemed to do the trick after a 6-9 month depression. I came down from 100 to 75mg in May and crashed 2 weeks later. Have been low low low since.  Will be weened of quetiapine when Lithium levels are stable and correct.  My sleep period can be anything between 10 and 12 hours. I just don't wanna get up and sorta sleep right through anyway. Some would say this is lucky! BUT, I am missing the day, say go to sleep 4am and wake between 2 and 4. Leaving no time to achieve anything during the day, when most things happen! I also have a real day/night thing going where I am super low (if I make morning) and 'brighten' up (using that in a very loose sense) as evening comes. Anyone else get this sleep stuff? Any good stories about Lithium too, how long does it take to work, Please no horror stories as it plays on my mind and I'm sure there are plenty. Thanks peeps, love and peace out. John. Message me if wanting to chat.

Hi. I've been with my Fiancé now gor two years. He has bipolar and ive always tried to be understanding & supportive. When we first got together he wasn't medicating at all, was heavily drinking (although managing to hold down a full time job). & didnt really care about himself.  It was hell on earth at first, but not at the same time. I knew nothing of this condition before I met him & it was so difficult.   Since then he has quit drinking with the help of AA, gone back on medication & is currently getting help with group cbt sessions. I've been to the library & read book after book, been to docs appts with him, been in touch with bipolar uk.  None of this helps me though when he suddenly 'changes'. I know we have both been through so much and have been fighting to help one another (I have clinical depression) but after yet another 'jekyl & hyde' episode I'm left wondering what the heck am I doing here? I love him so so much. He's my soulmate & when he's 'himself' he's the most caring, beautiful funniest man ive ever known. I keep reading about the mania & depression but no one mentions 'anger issues'. Which so often come into play with us where he can be fine one minute and explode into a ball of frustration and anger the next. Dont get me wrong he would never hurt me or my children but he says & shouts nasty things at me. So hurtful. Like Telling me to f*** off outta his face or to shut up crying coz its making him feel guilty. He accuses me of things that I haven done, that have arisen from situations that happened months ago but has been twisted into something it wasnt.  Like when he txt me to say he was setting off from a friends house (it was late, dark & he was cycling).  It takes 10 mins for him to get home from there. 30 mins later there was no sign of him. So I call his mobile to see if he's ok as I start to worry.  He was fine bit this happens about 3 times.  When he does come home he asked why I was still up. I said you forgot your keys.  That was it..end of. That happened months ago. Except yesterday he 'changed' and accused me of being angry with him & telling him off for being late home from his friends house. Said I even called to make sure he was on his way home. *ouch*  I woukd never do that, he knows that. Im not a controlling person & check up on him etc.  I just dont know what to do or how much more of this I can take. X 
I need help. I met this guy almost 7 months ago, it seemed that we had a good connection right away. I really liked him and it seemed the feeling was mutual. After dating almost a month, he told me he was bipolar and he takes medication everyday to help him. Lately I started to see some behaviour on him. Like depression, he tells me he had very bad episodes before and he was also hospitalized and also was on jail too for one of the episodes. I got really scared when he told me this but at the same time I knew we always got along well and he was kind and sweet to me, I haven't seen him mad at me or yell.  I am getting worry now because I kinda now when he gets depressed, he shots me off, won't talk to me at all, won't pick up the phone, things like that. It is frustrating because I want to help him but he won't let me in. And it doesn't help that we live far from each other. He is a very charming man. Loved by his friends and we'll like in his work. I care about him, maybe I love him and I don't want to loose him. I know it will affect me tremendously not having him in my life. IF someone knows how to deal with this. Please help me 
About 8 months ago my 12 year old daughter was diagnosed with depression and was put on 50mg of zoloft. Things seemed to get better but about a month ago it seemed like it platoed and her depression got worse. Last Tuesday her Dr. Increased her dose to 75mg. Now poop has hit the fan and I had to admit her in to the hospital for suicidal thoughts and self harm. In the ER the crisis  person and ER Dr said they think she was misdiagnosed and has bipolar so when we increased the dose her mood became more unstable. I know antidepressants can make mania worse but has anyone ever had depression get worse 
Hey guys I'm new to this forum but have been struggling with depression for a couple weeks now with suicidal thoughts at times and crying quite a lot and then feeling lost and numb. I had a hypomanic episode a month ago when I dyed my hair but recently my depression came back and I don't know what to do. Would adding a anti depressant to my other meds help? 
So worried about this change to pip ....anyone been successful.... 
I'm becoming concerned about myself, even when I was diagnosed with bipolar 4 years ago I wasn't as bad as I am now!! I'm on 5 tablets a day plus anti depressants . I'm totally at a loss! I've pushed people away by telling them I can't have them in my life ( some needed to be done as they took advantage ) but others there was no need!! My mood isn't stable, I'm feeling hopeless all the time, I want to sleep all day, I'm not eating , I'm emotional yet anger easily. I have no interest in anything. I feel guilty because I see my children see how I am, I'm a loving mum and look after them but I no I can do more. See now I'm crying just writing that cos I desperately want help!! The doctors don't seem to understand, even mental health team, I only see them when I have a breakdown for two sessions then they send me on my way with tablets. I want my life back!! I ruined my marriage from this horrible mental illness. I feel so alone but I want help and guidance but offered nothing but tablets. I try to help myself then I fail and give up. Am I the only one who gets like this because I feel like it. I would love nothing more than to fall asleep and not wake up for my selfish reason but I have 4 Beautiful children that need me and I need to be the best mum I know I'm capable of. Know one understands this condition from my family and friends I have left.  I want my children to see their mum can beat this and live a normalish life!! Has anyone got any advice please? I'll take anything on board. Thanks in advance ð

I can be very depressed and feel like everyone dont like me because Im "evil" and become so paranoid... but there are moments when Im so hyperactive and in perfect mood and even cant stop but talking... and feeling like best person in world.. i cant say im very happy then - because I dont think i will ever be and never get rid of guilty thinking but soo much better. And when I feel guilty thoughts I become thinking Im evil and worthless and even sometimes that I need to die.. i tried to kill myself once. I call it "Guilt moments" because it starts out if nowhere! Like obsessions that change whole me. I become different person. Everybody says that Im very strange because of my "mood swings" and "from high self confidence and hyperactivity i become depressed and paranoid" and I cry like every day... I just cant get rid of guilt for something i havent done! Like my brain dont recognize it.. I went to psychiatrust two or three times and he took me on Zoloft.. but I stopped coming so he hadnt heard my true thinking and feelings...

When I do things that relax me I feel extremly strange and guilty.. I have never relax or feel happy. I just cant understand myself anymore. I dont know whats wrong and who am I. Am I on wrong medication? I need good advice, please help me. Thank you! 
Hi all  Well I've been in therapy for some time,off and on over many years.  My therapist has said she thinks I have a form of bipolar, and asked that I goto my GP to ask for a referral to a psychiatrist for a final assessment and diagnosis.  Could anyone share what that assessment could be like? Many thanks 
Hi everyone. My first discussion started! I was diagnosed with BP 1 March 15 and have been struggling to get stable since. I was OK for about 5 months from December 15 to April this year. That was on 100mg Quetiapine. I went down to 75mg as I was feeling 'OK' but then crashed about 2 weeks later. Since 17th May I have lost all interest in life, can't / don't want to take my son, eating for Scotland (crisps, sweets etc.) at all funny times, sleeping between 12-14 hours a day, like, right through. I am in Scotland and it is very difficult to get an NHS phsychiatrist. I was so deperate I went to the Accident and emergency unit begging for an appointment. Saw a night doctor and he put me up to 150mg Quetiapine a month ago but doesn't seem to have done anything with my mood. I have pretty bad money problems too and can't handle looking at any of it. I don't want to speak to or contact my friends and then think I have not one friend in the world and no one cares if I live or die. Is this normal for BP depression? Anyone else feel like this. I have no life and it seems like I never will.  
Was put on lemotrogine and had issues. So far Geodon has been ok, but worried about long term effects. Was diagnosed about 4 months ago. Really screwed up my life I did. Now I have some understanding, but I'm struggling to make sense of it all.  
I was prescribed sodium valproate from April 2007 to Apil 2014 when I stopped it on reading it causes colon and prostate cancer.  I have suffered from prostate cancer and now it appears also Multiple Myeloma.  These cancers are known to require a trigger to set them going.  The only times I have had a hypomanic incident is May 1974, February 2006 (relapse October 2006 when I stopped taking Lithium to see what would happen.) 
Been awake for 3days. Don't feel that great but don't feel bad either. Getting very frustrated and anxious at night because I can't seem to sleep. Tried Valium and other stuff but doesn't seem to switch me off. Anyone else had this problem?  
My phyciatrist tells me this is really rare together??  I find it really hard to believe  or am I just paranoid. The lithium is working my moods are pretty stable no manic episodes but I am pretty low majority of the time  .. I believe the lithium is working as I'm not acting on suicide thoughts were as before I would . Iv been on sirtraline. .mirtazapine over the last 3yrs didn't do any good ..I'm now on venlafaxine was working well until another 2 major dramas happened in my life ..the dose just gone upto 225mg.. pls can someone shine some light .. I feel like I'm just an existence cnt cope feeling like this anymore ..  
Iv been under a pdr on & off for 20 years ..at 1st tried to say I had pd which I never & wouldn't agree to it. Then chronic depression /severe depression which I have & still do suffer with .. my daughter has had to live with the way I am for many years the crazy highs & the really bad lows.. suicide thoughts overdoses & all the pdr would do was up my meds .. it took for me to be pregnant to get real help .. yet again tried to say pd ..my daughter would not have it she done alot of research & realised I had bipolar 2. After thinking I had scitzophrenia (sorry nt sure of spelling ) with the moods ect..so for the past 3yrs iv been medicated properly for the 1st time . But on my reports it states bipolar disorder & severe depression? ? I really don't understand why.. I seem to fear my pdr & feel I can't question her.. can any1 shine some light please .. thankyou  
Hi..   I'm being referred from cpn to psychiatrist at the mo and I'm scared and don't know what to expect. I don't know if I have bipolar but I became 'high' after trying two different ADs. 200mg quetiapine is what I'm on now but I'm feeling like I want to cancel my appointments and stop taking my meds because what if there isn't anything wrong with me and I just need to learn to cope with life a bit better? :-( I have these horrendous lows but it's like I just have a complete meltdown every so often and then I seem to snap out of it at the drop of a hat. I feel like a bit of a fraud saying I might have bipolar because everybody I tell in the hope of support just looks at me like I'm making it up. Has anyone else felt like this. My symptoms are mild compared to others maybe I should just get a grip? :-(  
hi...   I'm currently on 100mg Quetiapine to see if it helps to stabilise my moods. I became too 'high' after trying SSRIs alone and the Quetiapine has really helped me to overcome this. However I'm now just feeling really quite low and I'm struggling. If I have bipolar depression surely 100mg is too low? I have an appointment but I wanted to chat to people who have been thru it too because I just feel so isolated right now. Any views anyone?  
Hi i'm brand new on this group, so i'm sorry if i'm posting in the wrong area...   I'm not writing for myself but my best friend is been diagnosticated with a bipolar disorder a few months ago.  He took other 3 months before than tell me that and i'm the only person wo knows that so far. No even his family or other friends.   He doesn't want to talk about it, take any meds or go to see a psychiatric as he had terrible experiences when he was a child.  He thinks that a lot of exercise, no alcohol and a regular sleep every day can be enough.  He's not actually having any big change of mood but this is not enough of course.  He's selfish, a liar, self-centric and he can disappear for days because he went who knows where without to say anything.  I don't know if i'm strong enough to help him and I can't force him to go to therapy.  I don't know how to help him. How can you help someone who doesn't want to be help? More: how can you help someone who doesn't realise that this are part of his sickness?   Sorry it's a long post but I don't know actually how to help him... how did you do it?  Thanks,  Marta  
Hi all.. Iv been on lithium for 3 years with not any problems it's stablised my moods never have any manic episodes anymore..my problem is trying to find a AD that's works with it.

I'm still very low with no motivation at all ..finding really hard to look after myself never mind the house. I just want to go to bed & never wake up ..please any info would be most grateful. . Thankyou  
Anyone comment on using st johns wort when bipoar and manic ? Please 
Hi all Any advice and ideas you can give me will be appreciated. So I met a guy at the end of last year on a website. We messaged and seemed to connect straight away. Let me just say we were both married at the time, honest with each other about it and can honestly say it was a friendship first and foremost. We messaged daily, got closer, swopped pictures of our kids, selfies, talked on the phone and seemed to just grow important in each others lives. The guy told me he had bipolar from the start, was completely open about everything in his life in fact and shared things that i knew he didnt share with anyone. A couple of times over the first 4 months he had times were he said he was getting low but always seemed to be able to talk to me.  We went to meet up a couple of times.First time he pulled out at the last minute, told me he was afraid I would be disappointed in him.  Second time he crushed his hand at work the day of the night we were going to meet and couldn't drive. I genuinely believe we were both as eager as each other to meet and talked openly that night about our feelings. We realised that we had got really close and maybe meeting not the best idea, neither of us wanted to risk doing anything stupid. We backed off but then realised we missed each other and our strange friendship continued. At the end of April I left my husband (not for this guy) and coincidently he attempted to sort his marriage out. Again we agreed to back off from each other but it only last a few days. Although I was single by then, I would never have suggested he leave his wife, he has two small children, and yes feelings were there but it was never about physical relationship. So mid May he went away to a wedding with his family for a week. We didn't message and when he got back he was quiet for a few days. When he did message he told me he had got really low, had had a mild psychotic episode, told me not to worry but that he needed time, that he cared but not to get upset if he didnt message as much and was seeing professionals and on a new tablet.   Here is were I guess I need advice or other opinions.  After it happened I  read up on bipolar, tried to understand it. I still messaged him, told him I was there for him. Tried to carry on as normal with my daily messages even though I knew he wouldn't respond to them. And just in general be a friend still. Occasionally he will message back with how he is doing, which is always  - okay, trying to be normal as I can. The only time  over the weeks he has actually asked any questions is about my love life which he takes a great interest in????? (Jealous or afraid I'll move on) So am I doing the right thing or should I give him space ? (He won't say either way) Is this time scale normal for an episode? ( he told me before that his normally only last 2 weeks) Am I the reason this has happened or at least part of the problem?? Is it likely that this will change him or when he is back to normal will we carry on as friends?? Is it that he just dosent care at the moment or even cares to much?? I want to be there for him but am afraid that one day he will just cut me out of his life.  Is it likely to happen?  I guess part of me wants reassurance and part of me wants to arm myself with information from people who know what he is going through Sorry I just don't have anyone I can ask for help. My friends just think he is playing with my emotions and tell me to cut him out of my life. Maybe he is, but from what he told me I don't want to believe that. Thank you to anyone who can help x   
Hi all my name is Megan I am 17 years old, I also have a disability I have avascular necrosis in both hips and have had it from a young age.   I do admit I have been depressed. Recently I have noticed my moods have changed a lot. One minute I will be ok one minute I'll be happy, one minute I'll be sad one minute I feel angry and annoyed. Some days I am not in a mood at all sometimes I feel like crying and hitting something. I've not told anyone before as I rather keep it to my self but I've noticed that my moods have been weird for the past few weeks now. A few days ago I was so happy but then I was so annoyed and everything. I don't know what to do anymore?. Should I go to the doctors?   One of my oldest sisters has bipolar could that be what's wrong with me?.    Thanks  Megan x  
Can anyone on here tell me if they get DLA or PIP for bi polar disorder I need to see if I can get this as I am unable to work now   
I have had bipolar typeI disorder for over 30 years yet as discussed in the book 'Blaming the Brain' there is no evidence whatsoever in support of the chemical imbalance theory of bipolar disorder type I. Why do so many people take on trust that which has no scientific verification? 
This last month has been difficult, my mother who was diagnosed bipolar tried to take her own life, I was having issues with money, and my girlfriend, the woman I want to be with till my final days was by my side the entire time. Just last weekend I did something super uncharacteristic, I got upset over nothing and packed all of my things in my car and said it was over, flipped out, accused her of making me feel like a road block because she is trying to obrain custody of her two little girls after a divorce and some legal paperwork said they could not live with us unless we had been together a year. Usually I am a very rational and patient and understanding person. Not this night. I had been having trouble eating and sleeping regularly and since my mother's suicide attempt. I've never yelled at this woman or lashed out at her and we had one of those fairytale romances... I was living out of my car, crashing at friends houses, and trying to figure out why she wouldnt even give me a chance to talk to her. So I becane paranoid and asked around about what could be going on. Did she hate me, is she leaving me for her ex husband, etc. I was having a seemingly endless panic attack and wanted to go be institutionalized because I was worried I would irreparably damage our relationship. She is distant but in my life still, she lost her grandfather to suicide due to bipolar disorder and prior to all of this I had never shown signs or symptoms. I feel so ashamed I hurt her and she said she thought she old never love again until she met me. I have in and out panic attacks at the thought of losing her romantically from my life for this fiasco considering I had no idea prior to this. I have immediately stared medication, setup therapy appointments for CBT as well as started a CBT workout book to help me manage my emotions and thoughts. I can accept with a heavy heart that she may not be able to be with me after this, but it fills me with so much anxiety because I lost her over something I had no control over. She still remains in contact and we talk and she told me to focus on myself and getting better. Am I letting my anxiety get the best of me and over analyzing this? My hardest part to overcome is I hurt her emotionally and may have lost her forever. 
Hi   Someone please give me some advise. I have bipolar 2 and in the past I was on epilim and seroquol and it worked sort of ok, except for the huge weight gain. Last year November I went for a couple of ECT sessions and the doc put me on Geodon and molipaxin. The first 2 months I didn't really had any side effects bothering me but then in Feb I had to stop using the Geodon as I had constant spasms in my face, biting my jaw and theeth, just could not handle it. Then in March the molipaxin caused my breasts to be so painfull that I could not thouch them, felt like they were being removed with a knife, I lowered the dosage and it got a little better but still too sensitive so I stopped that. My doc now started me on Lithium and I was so hoping that this would work as I am tired of changing meds all the time. Now I look 6 months pregnant. My stomach is so bloated and it physically feel like my stomach is stretching. It is beyond uncomfortable. And the seroqoul now suddenly make me urinate more and I don't need that as I suffer from an overactive bladder and then lets not mention the restless legs. It seems the longer I use medicine the more the side effects come out. I am so frustrated and and this moment I am going through a manic episode. The manic episode statred the end of March so i feel a bit frazzled. Will the bloating go away? Has anyone used Tegratol as a mood stabiliser? Any other suggestions on meds?

Hi, I have cyclothymia. i have read that this is classed as a mild bipolar, i have been told that as it is cyclothymia and not a bipolar 1 or 2 I would possibly be able to control this without medication. I've tried antidepressants for the downs but they make me 'switch' quite quickly. Has anyone tackled cyclothymia without medication and succeeded? I'm waiting for my CBT to start and I have got myself some books on mindfulness and a book on sleep to go through, I've also seen online a workbook like the ones for anxiety but aimed at cyclothymia. Am I aiming to high here to get through it without meds :-/ I've been offered meds, and Quetiapine helps me get to sleep if I'm having problems but I'm trying to avoid it :-/ anybody got any thoughts on all this xxxx  
I'm pretty certain that I have Bipolar disorder (without mania, just hypomania). I've felt like this for a long time and my partner also agrees. My Dad has bipolar too (but much more severe).   I really want to get better. I'm generally low, and it's having a real impact on my ability to thrive and acheive. I so desperately want to feel 'normal'. I would give anything not to battle with the constant self-doubt, self-hatred, frustration and self-blame. I have tried talking therapies to deal with anxiety, but there is incredible pressure to 'take control of your symptoms', and start to mange the condition myself. Trouble is, I feel physically unable to do this because I don't feel in control of my mood. I've lived with an awful lot of self-blame because the techniques 'should work', so I blame myself for not trying hard enough, and I hate myself for turning into my Dad because I've been trying so desperately to avoid this my whole life.  I know it isn't my fault and I should seek help but I am utterly convinced that receiving a diagnosis will have dire consequences for my future. I have worked incredibly hard to get a good degree - in Psychology would you believe, and if getting diagnosed means I will have my driving license revoked or it will some how stop me working with children, or in clinical psychology, I just can't bear it. I've seen the diagnosis/disorder have devastating consequences for my Dad, but in his case, like I say, it's much more severe. He's been sectioned under the mental health act.   It may seem irresponsible of me to not get a diagnosis, but I'm not a danger to myself, or to others, in general life or on the road etc. I'm just sad (or agitated in hypomania). I'm aware of how my symptoms affect me and I'm responsible and relatively in control (I don't take substances, don't engage in dangerous risk taking behaviour etc.). I'm sure many people feel this way, especially those with milder symptoms. Just to be clear, I am in no way implying that those with bipolar are dangerous or irresponsible, I just mean that I'm terrified that my doctor/others will hear bipolar and automatically assume the worst possible/most extreme symptoms, and treat me as though I can't be trusted to know my own mind, or I am somehow incapacitated. As if I 'need help' because I 'can't cope'. The latter may be somewhat true, but I'm not a moron, I'm just someone who doesn't know how to feel happy. I am emotionally unstable, but I don't unpredictably 'flip out' and I'm not unstable as in I can't be trusted to make good choices and be a reliable, trustworthy person.    I have a doctors appointment tomorrow but I just don't know if I can go through with it. I feel like I'm going to get given a life sentence which I will never be able to take back and will live to regret terribly. I'm so afraid that later on, I might feel that I'm better, or maybe I was mistaken and I don't have bipolar, but it will be too late and I will have to live with the repercussions of my actions - actions which were carried out when I was feeling very sad and in need of help. I think I'm confused because I understand the assessment process, and I know the meaning of the questions/statements on the bipolar scales. I'm scared that I might accidentally be too persuasive in convincing the doctor that I have bipolar because deep down I am motivated by the desperate need to find meaning in my experiences and because receiving a diagnosis of bipolar might mean that all of this isn't my fault, but more importantly, maybe I can get better.  I need to be fully prepared for the consequences of receiving this diagnosis. Anyone who can be honest and give me some clarity will be greatly helping me in my time of need. Please don't hold back and only tell me the positives. I want to know the negatives too. Thank you.  
I am a diagnosed bipolar and I'm wondering if something like Lithium would be better for controlling my mood swings instead of abilify and an antidepressant.  
I was diagnose about a year ago and have been dealing with being type 2 bipolar. I started taking lamotrigine and just got to 200 mg a couple months ago. When i initially started taking it at night, since i was told it may make me drowsy, but instead i would get a burst of energy/alertness and have difficulties sleeping. I changed it to the morning at around 100 mg and it helped me sleep at night. However, i am starting to be unusually sleepy in the mornings and i think it may be the lamotrigine. It doesnt typically start till and hour or so at work. I think it is now making me drowsy and want to try taking it at a different time. I know that drowsiness is a common Side effect but it didnt do that in the beginning.   Does anyone take lamotrigine and have smiloar problems? And what would the best way to experiment to find out without too much risk of affecting work or having a bad day from too pong without the medication.   Any help at all is greatly appreciated.  
I was dignoised with bipolar a year ago. at the begining of this year i was seen by another doctor who told me i didnt have bipolar. so i took his advice the next thing im going off the rails again and told my cpn this so i went back on to my bipolar tablets as clearly it is bipolar. since seeing this new doctor ive had no help at all and im now a week late on my meds and i know im loosing it again because they wont give me prescriptions. I am tiered of them not getting my prescription right that now i have been without them a week and starting to feel like im okay but i know im not ok.. if that makes sence meaning im going back to how i was and not better. so what can I do any help ?? advice?? anything please help as dont want to go back xx

I first became different from everyone when I was at primary school.  I was about 7 or 8 and really needed  to use the toilet in assembly and thought that the teachers wouldnât let me go and very nearly had an accident.  Ever since then Iâve had this phobia that I might have an accident in public and have always avoided situations without toilets and nearly always had panic attacks in those situations.  That has cause a lot of bother in my life and has really restricted what Iâve been able to do in life too â no car journeys, holidays, even walking down a street with no toilet along it.  I saw a therapist at 18 but he was an amateur and kept messing up and I got annoyed and stopped going.  I failed my A-Levels because I lost motivation and when I did eventually get into university I failed the first year because of a bit of a breakdown and then failed the second year for basically the same reason.  I go through a phase of having no motivation at all and a real empty sort of depression where I feel unmotivated, unworthy and I have no interest in anything or anybody and become quite reclusive.  My attendance was bad at Uni. mainly because I had a phobia of being in a lecture and needing the toilet and not being able to go and once I missed one I missed the whole lot and sunk right down.  It was my first year of Uni. that I became a bit obsessed with a girl.  She wasnât interested in me but I couldnât take no for an answer and all I could think about was this girl.  It went on for a month or two and became quite annoying for some people, mainly her.  When I wasnât depressed about it I thought it was humorous and used to make jokes about it and didnât take the thing seriously at all.  One day I had a sort of revelation and decided to turn my life around and made my sleeping patterns return to normal, stopped drinking so much, became more sociable, completely ignored the girl (I never did forget her) and was able to exist without her again.  I took a great interest in my guitar and went to the gym.  I got a girlfriend and was happy for a bit.  I changed course and re-started the first year of Uni. again but soon became unmotivated, lost interest in the course, and went back into myself again.  I still kept up a social life and still managed to hand in some very good piece of work, regularly achieving firsts and other good grades but it was a real struggle.  I still played guitar but didnât practice much at all.  I did get a band together with the aim of singing (Iâd never sung publicly in my life) and playing guitar (I couldnât play that well).  That idea failed due to no real genuinity in it.    I then worked for a boat company on the River Thames and life was great again.  The social life was great and I was good at my job and seriously considered a career in that profession but was sacked after 6 months or so due to âlazinessâ.  Iâm very laid-back and mostly donât talk to anyone I donât think I have reason to.  I got a name for being lazy and went along with it as a joke but it backfired.  It was also this time that I discovered I failed my second year of university and the two combined sent me into the darkest depression of my life so far.  The only thing keeping me going was a beautiful girlfriend who eventually had enough of a depressed and unmotivated boyfriend and left me too, compounding my depression.  I then got a job in an office and for 4 years was just a shadow.  I took no interest girls other than thinking about nice ones as I masturbated as much as 5 times a day.  I swung from not being remotely interested in my friends to meeting them and being the most conversive and entertaining person theyâd ever met (in my eyes anyway), the life and soul as they say.  4 months ago I quit that job with no job to go to with enough savings to live for 4 months independently but nothing more.  In those 4 months I havenât even applied for one job.  I havenât even looked for a job.  Now I have to move back in with my family.  I donât feel like I can do any job that exists out there but at the same time feel that I can do anything I want as long as I put my mind to it.  As I said before, I am quite laid-back, patient and good natured but I can experience these real big angry mood swings when things donât go my way which has got me into trouble in the past.  Iâm rude to people and sometimes destroy things.  For example I was having trouble a few days ago with the photocopier in the library that time and time again was jamming and taking more of my money and just walked out with credit in the machine and the job half-done as I came  so close to smashing the thing up and verbally attacking the library assistant.  Rudeness and dismissiveness really angers me too.  Sometimes, mainly when I was young and in my teens, I have been violent to people then felt really bad about it after.  Another thing I do is suddenly become as if I have had a revelation and try to change my life around in one fell swoop, as they say.  I make lists, try to give structure to my life, leave life-affirming quotes and messages for myself, write pages and pages of things to do and learn and really dive head-first into my hobbies like Iâm going to become the greatest in the world at that thing (guitar, songwriting, speaking French or Dutch, becoming a genius, creating art, philosophy, learning etc) and do really well in these things until I lose interest, start to question it all (not suicidal, Iâd never do that), and go back to staying in bed all day, not washing, not brushing my teeth, smoking weed, smoking tobacco, not wanting anything to do with my friends, being annoyed by their ways and attitudes and stupidity, masturbating and looking at porn.  When Iâm on what I think is an up phase I think Iâm great.  I think Iâm handsome and am better than everyone else and have more of a right to things than other people.  I get caught up in a hobby and amaze myself at the dedication I give it and construct a great plan to become the best the world has ever seen at that hobby.  Iâm constantly looking out for things that might help me get to that level including spending money on books and things like that.  I donât go on massive shopping sprees that cost a fortune but always go to charity shops and buy 4 or 5 books that I think will get me to that level but never read them.  Iâve got hundreds of books Iâll never read, even if I did have time.  Iâve never had any money so that sort of spending spree is quite bad even though it might amount to only £10 or something similar.  That moment has passed.  Iâm rarely interested in something when the momentâs passed.  Quite often I get depressed from failing at one of my grand plans.    One of the worst things I do is try to reach such a high that it will eclipse that previous record.  I got to the stage where I was smoking weed, drinking alcohol, sniffing poppers and masturbating over internet porn to get that high and was all I did night after night for weeks.  Iâve never got on well with alcohol.  If Iâm depressed it makes me more depressed and if Iâm feeling good it makes me feel very good and I used to ring people in the middle of the night looking for conversation, until my list of friends diminished.  The next day even if Iâm not hung-over I feel rotten.  I feel really guilty and cringe-worthy even if I havenât done anything to be guilty or cringe-worthy about.  I feel let down by my behaviour in a way.  Itâs a feeling I find hard to express.  When I smoked that just made me feel lethargic, down, drained and sh*t.  No-one Iâve spoke to will admit to feeling like that with smoking.  Iâve never felt inclined to commit suicide (Iâve thought about it rationally and rejected it as a viable solution) and my depression manifests itself more in amotivation than anything else.  Having no motivation is the story of my life.  I think because when Iâm feeling good I no whatâs its like to really feel alive and see how much opportunity there is in life.  Iâve always been quite level-headed and intelligent so have rarely done anything foolish or burnt my bridges.  I havenât really spoken to a doctor about any of this and have only just really started reading into bipolar disorder.  I donât like doctors and see them as self-interested amateurs and my experience of them seems to back this up.  Iâve used anti-depressants in the past for my anxiety but only for a week or two as they interfered to much with my all-important sex-life by making me unable to orgasm.   Socially Iâve never really been able to keep up.  No sooner to I meet people and get a good crowd of friends but I start rejecting them and either looking elsewhere for more stimulating interaction or sink into myself.  Being up and down shares similarities with each other for me.  When Iâm down I donât want to interact with people and when Iâm up I canât be bothered with them.  They donât do enough for me.  When Iâm down I masturbate a lot.  When Iâm up I masturbate a lot.  When Iâm up and down Iâm very insular and mainly exist within.  Iâm always being told Iâm extremely intelligent and I agree.  They tell me I should be doing more than I do and Iâm holding myself back but that makes me feel bad because I know that but thereâs nothing I can do about it.  Iâve tried and failed many times.  I canât hold educational course down and really abhor authority.  Iâm not shy and Iâm not outgoing.  I seem to be both depending on how I feel that day.  Iâve never really understood how you can be one and not the other all your life.  Another thing is Iâm really into ideas (History of Ideas and Philosophy was my Uni. course) and once I get started on a subject I know about (quite a few) I can talk for hours but most of the time I think people arenât worth wasting my time on so I seem rude and arrogant.  I seem to have a head-full of ideas, solutions and explanations that I need to do something with them.  I started myself on St Johnâs Wort a few weeks ago and the same day I started I started feeling much better and quite high and determined.  Since then Iâve been studying song-writing, sight-reading and playing guitar like its going out of fashion and have been a lot more sociable and positive.  All I want to do is succeed and create something to be proud of.  My appetite has basically vanished or at least is well bellow the point when Iâm down and eat too much and put on weight.  So hopefully youâve made it through all that.  Its long but Iâve had some beers, Iâm feeling good and its 3 in the morning and I want to get it all down while I feel like I can.  The basic question is â does this sound like someone who has bipolar disorder or someone with long-term depression or what?  Or am I looking too much into it after having read about bipolar disorder?  Maybe Iâve subconsciously made it sound more like its bipolar than it is.  Also has anyone else experienced similar things to what Iâve just written about?  If you want to reply to this message please feel free to do so or email me at gig88888 hotmail com 
Hi all I'm new here. I'm a bit worried. I was being treated for depression with Fluoxetine 20mg however when it kicked in it made me symptomatic of hypomania. I was referred to a CPN and now undergoing assessment. I went very low when I came off the Fluoxetine so have been put on Sertraline 50mg. If they suspected a mild bipolar would they have done this?  
I;ve had depresssion since 7th grade. I've been hospitalized twice and was put on medication. I just found out recently that my official diagnosis is bipolar disorder. This whole time I thought I just had depression and now that my diagnosis is different than I thought, I'm back at square one. I don't even know where to start (Iv'e tried googling but to no avail.) 
For 20 years I/ve been diagnois with Chronic Depression.   The past 3 years my medicine wasn't working and tried others.  It was getting worse my behavior was out of control.  Finally I got a Psychotrist and a Psychologist and was recently diagnois being Bi Polar.  I'm taking Depakote.  I am experiencing all the uncommon side effects.  Memory loss, suicide thoughts, confussion, vision blur, etc....I wanted my Dr. to let me try another drug.  There are so many.  Instead I was taken advantage of from my confussion I agreed to stay with the drug and the dosage was increased.    Isn't that messed up?   The side effects are very bad, I know my body.  Is this normal for a Dr. to increase a medication that I am experiencing bad side effects?? 
Hi. I am currently being assessed after a reaction to Fluoxetine. Im told I definitely do not have bipolar type 1 but they want to go through my history.   A few years ago I had a baby. I found it traumatic as I didn't know what to expect. I also didn't know that some of the feelings I had afterwards weren't normal. My feelings were of paranoia, lost grip with reality, very strange behaviour I thought someone powerful was watching over me telling me to do things. I remember shouting and screaming on the ward after I'd had my baby but I was just given a sleeping tablet and the rest I can't remember. The strange bdhaviour continued for a couple weeks but I must have came out of it of my own accord as the hormones calmed down. I didn't discuss with midwives at the time but they did do a depression questionnaire on me, which came of nothing. Years later and not so young I had another baby, this time none of this happened so I realised my first experience wasn't normal. I've had a few years of dealing with stressful situations. But through this I achieved many good things and have at times taken on far more than the average person. This was until about four years ago when the low moods began, but outside stresses were increasing. I definitely bit off more than I could chew again and became very very low. All this and eating disorder, terrible pmt, obsessive behaviours, irritable and angry, unthought out decisions and self destructive behaviour such as leaving jobs and quitting things I'd taken on thinking I could manage. I'd rather quit than ask for help. The depression became severe and I was put on Fluoxetine. I was symptomatic of hypomania. The last time I felt like this is just had my baby. Does this sound like mild bipolar or just someone who needs to look after themselves and slow down? Is the baby incident relevant to my CPN?   I know this is a public forum but I need help.   Thankyou xxxxxxxxxx  
I've just been told I might have Bipolar. I'm not so sure and would love your detective guys's help?  Can it change super quick.. a few days quick?  I get really depressed and then extatic which seems like bipolar... but within a few days of each other. So Monday, Tuesday crazy acting like a toddler. Then thursday wearing off but Friday and Saturday I can't even get of bed,sleeping 18 hours at a time.  This has been happening for a few months but before it was weeks between changes in mood.  It's so hard to deal with, please does someone else have this too? 
How is depression usually treated in bipolar 2? Are mood stabilisers started before, after or at the same time as antidepressants?   My lows i can't deal with off the meds, my highs I cause to much trouble on the meds. I'm new to all this please help!!  
Hi all, I could really do with some help at the moment.   I'm diagnosed Bipolar and also Borderline Personality Disorder. About a month ago, my wife was diagnosed with Stage 1 Renal (Kidney Cancer), and has just had a successful operation to have her gallbladder removed. We have two children, our eldest being four and the youngest being almost four months old. My wife is recovering well but has been 'out of action' for almost a week now.   This time around though I've found my wife being ill extremely stressful. Whilst we're all confident she will make a full recovery from her kidney surgery, her gallbladder surgery has still been really stressful on us as a family, with me taking over responsiblity for our newborn whilst our eldest stays with family. I've found the responsiblity almost too much to handle, and I've almost gotten ill in the past few days with it. My wife's kidney surgery is in early May, and I'm terrified about how I'll deal with a) her being ill, which sets my BPD on edge and b) the responsibility of our children, which I find really stressful to start off with.  Have any of you lovely people been in a similar situation, and do you have any tips as to how to negotiate such a stressful time? I'm really concerned that the stress and tiredness could be a huge trigger for me- I'm scared that I'll get suicidal or begin self harming again, or worse. What advice would you all give me?  Thanks a lot and hope you're all doing keeping well!  Charlie 
I'm wondering if anyone in the UK has found a way out from Bipolar disorder via the NHS?  In short, my mother had a traumatic experience with a fire about 7 years ago.  Since then she's been to more doctors than I can count, with each one seeming to disagree on what medication she should be on.  She's had years of coping with side effects coming off one medication and I feel the doctors treating her have lost sight of any baseline to show exactly what my mother is actually suffering for.  Initial diagnosis was severe depression, which shifted to bipolar, and I'm not even sure if all the doctors agree on that.  We also tried private through my fathers work but she discharged herself.  She's been to hopsital multiple times for overdoses, and the last year or so, whatever she's on has turned her into a borderline alcoholic.  She says the has constant voices in her head telling her to kill herself for at least the last year, without end, and uses the alcohol in an attempt to escape it.  NHS say that she doens't currently meet the criteria for being sectioned, and meanwhile my family are coping the the drama and scenes she causes on a daily basis.  Surely 7 years of ongoing diagnosis and failure to treat my mother can be brought up in court as some sort of incompetency?  My mothers life and those around her has been made a misery for over 5 years and it's getting to a point where we just can't cope anymore - she needs constant care and supervision I feel, in order to make her better (along with the right medication!!).  If anyone has any advice on what action to take it would be much appreciated. 
In 2014 I was finally referred to a Psychiatrist, now in 2016 I believe I am finally well medicated, and treated for the disorder. I have also finally got my life sorted and stopped my self destructive lifestyle. I work and go to uni so am busy all the time. Theres just one thing preventing me from getting and thats when I think back to some of the things ive done before being medicated I feel ashamed and disgusted with myself. I wasnt a bully or anything only bad to myself whilst being self destructive.   So my question to the form is there any books or anything i can read to figure out how to move on with life and stop living in the past? 
Hi  I'm 19 and was diagnosed with Bipolar at around 13. I have been on Lithium and Prozac since around 15 after trying various anti psychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine and aripiprazole (two of which caused sode effects that put me in hospital).  After 12 months of my mood being stabilised I am now in the midst of a relapse along with a bad bout of insomnia. My psychiatrist has prescribed Zopiclone to try make me sleep but is considering adding Quetiapine to my list of medications.  My question is to those who take or have taken Quetiapine about their experince of it in terms of side effects and if there were any problems in terms of interactions with other medications? 
Hi, ive had a manic episode for about a week now and last night i went out on my own, I consumed a massive amount of alcohol and gambled away £500... to top it off I ended the night by enganging in very risky activities. I have a beautiful wife at home and a beautiful 3 year old daughter,,, we also have a second child on the way. I hate myself so much, am i selfish? is it my bipolar that sends me on these intense alcohol fulled nights or is it just me? and as usually the manic stage has disappeared and has been replaced by guilt and worry. please help 
Hi. I'm 37 anad I've been struggling with bipolar disorder since age 14. I've tried so many medications, ECT, TMS, the Amen Clinic, and supplements that my psychiatrist has no idea what to do. My illness has cost me my friendships, my husband and my daughter. My mom is the only person I have in my life at the moment. Everyday I wish I could die. I've tried to kill myself 4 times, but I couldn't get it right. I would do it right now if I knew of a sure way that could not go wrong. I don't know what to do anymore. All I do is hurt and cry. 
I have suffered on and off all my life with what I thought was depression. Looking back I did get the highs but I liked them most of the time because I could get things done bit after baby was born was diognosed with post natal depression and whilst taking my son to be assessed as he has had adhd for 9 years seen signs as my brother has type 2 mixed moods. The phychariast told me she could not assess my son because I needed to be assessed first I thought they were joking I noticed my highs were worse and my lows were even worse but told her Dr put me on prozac  a few months ago and had sent me over. Anyway after 2 meetings with crisis team and 4 appointment  with phychariast and home treatment team here everyday have to accept I do have a problem. My highs are like volcanos  waiting to abupt  yo the point I stabbed myself to see if the pressure woukd ease off. No it didn't just in case anyone wondered get so dust rated.  Then drop like a ton of bricks can't get up feeling what's the point. If not for my children I don't think I would be here. I'm on 20mg diazipam and only take 5mg at a time if to stresses . They took me of the prozac and gave me alpripasol  but just upped it to 15mg. Sleep very little but always panicking if pills start going low.  I am also my son's carer and have a 16 month old baby who I feel so guilty about not doing everything a mummy should tty and force myself to take him swimming ect. Does this get better. Today is a very low day and although I have told prof I would not consider suicide but do secretly hope for way to die through illness ect then not my fault and my kids can't blame me or hate me for it. I also am caring for 2 terminally I'll parents so when someone said what about u. My response was I don't matter. I don't want to feel like this just want to be better. Any advice ps they also say I can't drive this is sending me over as I need to get around and get afford taxi everywhere I told them only take pills at night so why do I feel everything is being taken from me. Sam 
I recently had some plastic surgery and have been experiencing some mania.  I have stayed on my meds and never missed a dose.  I've not had an episode in almost 9 years so I am wondering if this might be the cause.  I have googled the hell out of this topic but have not gotten anything definitive.  I see my doc on Wednesday but would like to know if anyone else has had this happen to them. 
I had a cortisone injection and SEVERE PAIN in the area for 12 hours. Then I had a serious mania like I have never known. It was just very severe and involved serious relationship harm.  Am I just imagining that the cortisone injected in to a shoulder joint cause this? Rox 
Hi guys I'm new here but I really need some advice..  I'm bipolar only diagnosed 18 months ago, treatment and medication are working well.

I'm scared I'm not strong enough to support my mum and my young son though this tough time, and after my aunt has crossed over.

Hi everyone,   I have just been diagnosed as bipolar around 2 months ago. I'm only 20 but have had these extreme moods since I was about 15. I'm on aripiprazole at the moment but it doesn't seem to be helping. How long should I wait before telling my psychiatrist that I'm not feeling any better?  
I have had Bipolar Disorder for most of my life, but wasn't diagnosed until about seven years ago. It was more of a self diagnisis really, I couldn't understand why I was behaving in such an irrational way and put the cause down to the impact of a dysfunctional childhood which was full of emotional and physical trauma. I read a book about Manic Depression and my symtoms jumped from the page. Because I am a gifted pianist, at first I thought that it was vaguely glamourous because so many creative people have had this illness. We only hear about the ones who have managed to survive though. At the age of nineteen two international concert pianists wanted me to go to Music College. If I had known then that I had this illness I would have been on medication and perhaps managed to find the stability and discipline to follow it through. I'm an intelligent and articulate person and have tried to do so many things in life which have all ended in failure. I'm not sure what i want to do with my life at the moment, but am in no hurry to make a decision. Lithium really does help to get you on an even keel. If you stay on that roller coaster without taking any medication - you'll just keep going around in circles and achieve nothing. That alone is enough to make anyone depressed! By not sticking with Lithium I have managed to lose my job, a house without a mortgage, lots of nice people who were friends and my self esteem. This illness is like a wild dog - it has to be tamed. Acceptance is the hardest thing. Admitting that you have a problem. Don't be fooled by this illness. If you feel ok - it doesn't mean that you are cured. It's an illness which is going to be around for the rest of your life, but that doesn't mean that you have to let it cripple you. I was on Lithium last year and came off it because I felt better. It was a huge mistake. I got involved with a business partner who took me for a ride and i lost a lot of money. If I had still been on Lithium, maybe when I got stressed I would have been able to cope a lot better, but it's too late to know. Good luck - and for heavens sake go and see your GP if you need medication. You owe it to yourself and to all those people that love you.:ok:  [i:40d621b6b4]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:40d621b6b4] 
I was diagnosed in 2001 with bipolar,  only to have a psychiatrist tell me in 2011 that I was in the top 15% for severe bp1 disorder!  I've been on and off many meds since 2001. What I always seem to deal with is this grey cloud that seems to hang over me most of the time. A new psychiatrist put me on zoloft before Christmas last year; I'm up to 150mg for 2 months now. I don't think there's anything out there that can help me. My life sucks; I'm on a disability income plus I work part time for peanuts. I just can't see my life getting any better no matter what I take! I'm tired of feeling like sh*t! I'm good for awhile,  then that cloud finds me again. My support system is basically nil. Any insite out there? 
I had an episode over Christmas time, where I experienced psychosis and amidst this I fought with my partner and left him. I was experiencing strange thoughts whereby I thought my partner was in some conspiracy against me and that I was being used by him. My delusions were more complex than that but I'll be brief, I felt like I was being threatened and my partner was demonised in my mind. I ended up going on facebook and writing about him being a rapist (completely untrue and all part of my delusions as I felt like I was pulling someone up on a witch hunt). I have a lot of his family as friends on there and they all saw what I'd written and thought I was being malicious. Luckily it was all sorted quickly as I deactivated my account. However, I'm not terrified of seeing his family. Not many people know I am bipolar and I know most would be none the wiser if it wasn't for my out burst on social media. I am still seeing my partner but I am terrified about facing his family again as I don't think they will understand. I would never say a bad word against him and I just wish I knew a way to explain that it's all down to an illness and was not malicious. How do I get over this and move on with my life? 
Hi, Anyone experience about depressive or bipolar?  If when someone first diagnosis bipolar then require to hosptaliziation or just start take medication? If not hosptalization then why people who have bipolar require to hosptalization ?  Hope you explain this you have experiences?  Thank you   
I have bipolar which was in remission for almost a year, up until possibly a few weeks ago when my best friend died.  I have been smoking weed for a few months now, pretty much daily - if I'm not in work, I'm high. I know, it's bad.  The dr thinks I'm rapid cycling now with hypomania and depression. He has prescribed 5mg of Abilfy to be upped to 10mg within a week.  Questions: 1) does anyone know of any documentation that would give any indication of what could happen when smoking weed chronically while taking Abilify?  2) does anyone have any experience mixing the two? 3) or does anyone know of what may happen when mixing the two?   I know I'm going to get judged for aggravating the bipolar with weed but please I just want to mostly know the physical side effects or anxiety effects etc.    
Hi my name is Lewis, I have bipolar 2 and have done for 3 years just over although I have only been diagnosed for around a year and a half. During that time I must say.. It is and has been the most challenging part of my life to date and honestly feel ill never face something so difficult to over come. I'm wondering if there are some people reading this thinking " actually there will be harder things in life to over come. Everyone including myself would actually say yes there is. For me though bipolar seems to affect everything! So it won't be the other taxing and hard things that we have to try and over come in life,  it will be trying to deal with how my bipolar  reacts during these events.   Recently and in the past things have been absolutely terrible,  from the exterior things seem pretty OK but inside I'm breaking and not sure how to fix myself.   In the past iv come very close to ending it because my brain and body just couldn't handle what was going on. Terrible feelings of guilt extreme anxiety, abnormal mood swings, intrusive thoughts, insomnia because of the anxiety, suicidal thoughts so on and so on.  I have a family and them being my soul purpose in life which has also been pushed to the breaking point because of my severe mood swings,   I'm currently on mirtazipine and quitiapine which seems to keep me Farley stable but I constantly struggle as stress is my trigger and I'm a self employed business owner, I'm currently struggling to perform my duties at work and I feel I just can't manage tge stress of it all! Not only that my job is physically very demanding and I feel I cant manage both, I'd rather have one or the other.   Sorry if my post doesn't make much sense, it's my first time publicly talking about this. Well in a forum as have spoken with family. As much as they are highly supportive, they just don't get it.  
I've been sufffering from bipolar disorder for 6 years and have to take medications up to now. Now, i have to take Divalproex sodium extended release tablets 250 mg and Aripriprazole 5 mg once a day. In the past, mood swings occured frequently and now the same. Moreover, i got drowsy all the time. Now, I'm getting depressed. Our final exam is drawing near and I'm getting much worry about to pass the exam. I'm in stressful condition now. Please help me. What should i do? 
I am looking to wean off my current medications which are used to treat my Bipolar Disorder II, which include: 100 mg Zoloft daily 100 mg Lamictal daily Xannax on an as needed (emergency) basis - about .25mg - .5mg every other week.  I have heard all the scares of being sure to wean off slowly with the Lamictal (10-25% every 2 weeks), but I haven't seen much about how to do so with the combination of meds. Should I do so with the Zoloft as well?  I tend to have more issues with mania (especially insomnia, racing thoughts, and anxiety) than depression. I am ok with continuing the Xannax as needed, but would like to get rid of the constant daily meds. I have side effects immediately when I miss a dose, and I am not feeling comfortable relying on this with my Insurance being set to expire in a few months (looking to treat with more natural/organic means).  I would very much appreciate your thoughts! Thank you!  Jamie 
Hi, I have always been on alot of meds but lately, People are comenting on the way I carry on, a bit away with the faries. Meds are Bisoprol, Ramipril, Eplerone, Venafaxin,Mirtazipine,Quetiapine and injectables for Diabetes. No I feel the best I have in ages. It`s just the distrust that I am not taking other drugs or drink (have beeen dry for over a year)  Even though I`m going out of my way to make improvement and life easier. peoples first comment is "You look like your on something," Tried highlighting the relevant text in the med info sheet, no change...As I have no jod, I cant move, and I love my parents but cant take all these acusations all the time Any Ideas?. 
Hi all,  My psychiatrist recently started me on 10mg of Aripriprazole (Abilify), to compliment my other medications which are Lithium 1000mg, Quetiapine 200mg and Melatonin 2mg.  Whilst I really like the medication, which is used to bring down my highs (of which I suffer almost constantly when I'm not depressed, I have next to no 'normal' periods in between), I've really suffered with the side effects. I take the Abilify in the morning with breakfast, and I've found the I'm constipated and really anxious and jittery. Have any of you guys found the same reaction happens to you? I know my jitteryness isn't from my mania because it feels a lot different and bit more intense in some ways- I can't focus on a film, I struggle to read my book for more than 5-10 mins and am always jumping from, say, playing the guitar, then the piano, to cleaning the kitchen, to doing the laundry, all of which are uncompleted in the space of 3 or so minutes.   Do any of you have this reaction? Does it pass with time or do I need to think about changing medication?  Thanks! 
I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 19 through out my life I've had good and bad relationships but my recent eight year relationship is now in the balance as today I've found out the man I've trusted with my heart and soul has been chatting to another woman and has been using very explicit sexual innuendo when I confronted him about it he just laughed saying it's just a laugh nothing serious but to me it's deverstating I feel used and betrayed and I'm now questioning every thing about him I love him with all that I am and now feel totally worthless as a woman and a partner I had no idea there was anything wrong with our relationship and I'm now cycling between anger, hurt and self-doubt has anyone else gone through anything similar any advice. 
When I was thirteen, I broke up with my first girlfriend. This came as a hard blow to me as I loved her dearly. I can't begin to describe what I was feeling, what was going through my head. Everyone including my family told me I would be fine and that eventually I would get over it but I never did, I'm 18 and I still haven't. My behaviour was very unpredictable afterwords, constant lows with mixed highs and I was extremely aggressive to people who didn't necessarily deserve it. I have destroyed relationships, friendships and even family members have had enough. I was put into care because my family didn't know what else to do. My whole time through care, I was either high or drunk. That was my coping mechanism and I would go out my way to get either cannibis, or alcohol. I couldn't face reality then and I still have trouble with it now. Since then, I have been on citalopram, fluoxitine and various medications for anxiety. Recently though, things have escalated to seriously dangerous circumstances. One night, I was very irritable and my brother had said something that shouldn't of bothered me, but it set me off. I struggle remembering, but the court case which is now against me states I brandished a knife and held it to his throat. The court requested there psychiatric assessments done and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was initially started on lithium 600mg but the has been increased to 800mg awaiting blood test results. I have been put on lamotrigine to combat the lows as well. I have a real hard time believing this is me and I don't see myself as having bipolar, but I recently found out my birth father is bipolar too so it seems possible. My highs are almost like cocaine binges, one minute buzzing the next losing the plot. My lows, are bad. I isolate myself to the point of refusing to leave the house because I'm generally afraid of going outside when I'm feeling like this. I either sleep to much, or to little and this affects daily routine. The simplest of tasks like brushing my teeth, or taking a shower is the hardest task of the week. I'm just struggling really and any advice or personal experiences anyone is willing to share, I would appreciate it a lot. Thanks guys  
My psychiatrist put me on olanzapine again recently.  I was seriously manic, and I had him worried.  The interesting thing is that now eating anything with a lot of sugar makes me irritable.  Do you guys think that this is a product of taking the olanzapine, or do you think that I am noticing it more, because for the first time in 25 years, I'm neither manic nor depressed and have more room in my head to think?  Also, does anyone else notice that they get irritable with a higher sugar intake?  Thanks!  
Ive been diagnosed with bi polar for over a decade. For the better part of the decade I had found sort of a working balance of 900 lithium 5mg lexapro. I was also drinking at least 2 a week fiarly heavely. I got sick last summer and have cut drinking out to 1 maybe every 2 weeks 1 a week the most and way less qauntity. I have started excersizing and am in a healthy stable relationship and have a low stress job. I stopped taking the lexapro before I got sick and am currently trying limictol. I have been experiencing tons of anxiety and a lot of very intense periods of manic energy since I cut back on the drinking the 8 months. Not sure if limictol will help but need to know a good suggestion for settling my system down. It seems like goal oriented tasks and creative stuff like working on music really create a lot of these intense manic bouts. Also diagnosed recently with add adhd. Need suggestions on maybe a medication to take for anxiety and these crazy wound up periods of mania I get just trying to do things I love and sick creativty and organization of my life making me feel sick

Hi all,   Does anyone here experience fairly radical shifts in mood with their Bipolar?   Here's some background. I'm newly diagnosed as of November and am taking Lithium 1000mg, Quetiapine 200mg and Melatonin 2mg. Since early November I've been in a dreadful depressive episode, during which I was diagnosed with a comorbid Borderline Personality Disorder. Last Monday, 5 months almost to the day since my depressive episode began, I've experienced a radical change in mood. My Borderline symptoms have decreased dramatically, I'm feeling more capable, both emotionally and physically, much happier and a not in slightest bit depressed. I have had days that I've felt a little jittery and bit too excited to be alive, but its a lot more calm than last year when I wasn't on Lithium. I'm able to focus a lot better and generally feel great!   Does this happen to anyone else? Do any of you experience really dramatic changes in mood, and what are your cycle lengths?  Thanks a lot!  Charlie 
MI have noticed my partner has moos swings one minute hes fine the next he isnt he says things out if the ordinary to make me and ans sad i cant take it anymore we are drifting apart help 
Hi all  I've suffered from anxiety and depression for many years, and bipolar has been mentioned as a possibility by some therapists,but not all. What led to your diagnosis? What made the drs or therapists actually decide?  I wouldn't say I have mania, more hypomania.  But I can be badly depressed for many months,then times of very productive anxiety,then back to depression. This has went on for many years, but noone seems willing to make any kind of diagnosis 
Hi  My boyfriend is in a really manic state. I don't know if he has bipolar as he's always in denial he has any kind of mental illness but right now he's screaming that he's going to kill my family, he does not stop screaming, he's completely out of touch with reality. I get all the blame (I've just been ill myself with anxiety attacks etc). I have been hiding in the bedroom away from him all day. I don't know what to do but I can't cope anymore ð¢  
Hi Im more looking for some advice. My girlfriend has Bipolar, we have been seeing each other for a few months. But she gets really low when ever friends get in touch with me. I am quite popular and Im not intrested in other women but I do have a handful of female friends, I am also friends with my Ex wife (whom i have 2 kids with) When shes low , she always accusses me of cheating on her. Im new to being suportive for her in low times and I do the best I can. However I need to know if this could be a trigger for her, Could I actually make her low because of this. I know she wants me to turn my back on my friends but I cant do that, I really love her but dont know if Im making her worse. I want to be supportive when shes low but dont want to give in to her demands of ditching my friends. She says some horrible things to me when low but I can take that, I explained to her that my friends are my support network and that I need people to talk to sometimes. I really want to be with her and love her dearly, but dont know what to say when the conversation about friends comes up, I say no and she gets worse, I say I will give her space and she gets worse. I really feel like Im inbetween a rock and a hard place but dont know what I should do.  
When I was 19 I was told I had depression and had probably suffered from it for many years but at 19 I didn't want to accept it because I thought it must have been a mistake so I tried to get on with life bit my relationships kept failing I suffered from panic attacks hated be in crowds felt down all the time and I had a lack of energy or drive, im 30 now and about 8 years ago I created fake Facebook profiles and I used these with people I was dating almost as a tool just to find out how the people I was seeing viewed me and felt about me I even had conversations with my fake profiles which was madness, I refused to except depression was something I was suffering from but a few months ago I had a break up and it was 70% my fault lack of drive to work, emotional detached, I told stupid lies that I didn't have too and I even used the Facebook profiles I had created but only at the start of the relationship, I flirted with other people never with an intention to cheat but so I felt liked, I quit a job because my partner was unwell and was worried something would happen when I wasn't there but I even lied about that and said the place I worked got  closed down, I created a whole fake back ground mostly by word of mouth because I didn't feel anyone could live me for me as my own father couldn't but after this recent break up I looked back through my relationships and realised all of them had said or implied I was emotionally with drawn, I had mood swings etc.....I don't know if I will ever get my ex back as much as we lover each other at some point but I want to be able to explain myself and I feel the only way to do that is by seeking help and working out why I never feel good enough, I have no drive, low self asteem, I lie about stupid things,why I have panic attacks and why I emotionally distance myself....All advice is welcome   
I hadn't been in a relationship for almost 4 years when I met my current boyfriend. I was diagnosed with bipolar about 5 years ago. I'm pretty good at handling myself when it's just me but I'm having problems keeping it together around my boyfriend. He has a 3 year old daughter and insists that we sleep in separate beds when she's over for fear of setting a bad example. Keep in mind, we currently live together. At first, I was handling it okay. Now, it's really getting to be an issue. I'm tired of being evicted from my own bed every time his daughter comes over since she sleeps with him. I feel like it's negatively affecting our relationship. He says I'm being overly sensitive and accuses me of being jealous of his daughter. I don't know if this is how I'm coming across. My family keeps asking if my bipolar is coloring my vision and how I'm perceiving things. I've upped my medicine dose and have spoke with other people about the issue. I don't think my bipolar has anything to do with it. My boyfriend tells me I need to take my meds because I'm acting crazy. I know what I feel but everyone is blaming it on my bipolar. I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do. I don't want to break up with my boyfriend but I've expressed how lonely and isolated I feel when we are sleeping apart. Just an fyi, sometimes we have her for weeks at time so it isn't short term all the time. Nothing is changing. I'm starting to dread when his daughter does come over because I know what's going to happen. It's nothing against her, it's just that I despise the sleeping arrangements. Not to mention he doesn't discipline for bad behavior which doesn't help. I love him and his daughter to death but I get so depressed when she's over because of everything so it's really difficult for me to bounce back and it usually takes a while before I feel normal again. Can someone please help? Is this really my bipolar messing with me or are my feelings about the whole situation valid? 
Are there any doctors out there that know exactly what gets checked during a lithium blood test. Do they also look at your full blood count? I know the usual things like thyroid and kidneys but I am just wondering if the normal things get checked too.  
For months I've been a down right bitch. Went to Dr my lithium levels were slow they said that would explain my moods. Was on 600mg now on 1500mg of lithium er any thoughts: 
Hi im a 31  year old woman ive been diagnosed with ocd and panic disorder at age 15. Im wondering if someone can help me with a ongoing issue ive Had for 8 yrs I get this noise on the left side of my head near my left ear it sounds like there's a crowd of hundred people chattering fast chattering kinda like its a busy shopping centre and hundreds of people are all chatting at the same time this noise /sensation is only on my left side its and internal noise not external I dont think its different people but it sounds like it is. Normally when ive experienced this brain thing,  it last for a week or two and it happens once a year but this time ive had the noise since November last year with only three days of a break. The other symptoms ive had since November are intense panic attacks and ocd has gone high cause im obsessing about this noise in my head,  pms has increased since November to a point were im feeling rage during pms and I mean im agitated over small things which is not me.  Ive seen a doctor had blood tests and hormones checked everything is normal but yet think im not well.  I have no symptoms of psychosis just this noise no delusions or break from reality i also dont have bipolar symptoms so im stuck with what the hell this werid brain thing is does anyone relate to this.   
Hi, I wonder if anybody is in a similar position. After a traumatic childhood I finally accepted a phyciatric Referal. Because I was only in the room for 2 minutes when the doctor said "you are bipolar" Ive spent 20 odd years refusing to believe this. I did go on medication for a few years that made me feel like a zombie. So I came off and have spent all of this time in therapy, but using alcohol and privately bought benzodiapin to manage constant mood swings. Settee for days, major panic attacks then feeling or thinking I'm better. Only really realising lately that this is possibly hypermania as I become obsessed with buying things, hobbies, or business ideas. I'm growing to accept I'am a manic depressive regardless. Has anyone been through this mental fight of accepting a phyciatric label and then felt alot better once medication finally sorted? So confused and scared but can't live like this anymore. Also, has anybodies symptoms of mood swings got significantly better when being off of meds and alcohol? Any constructive support would be gratefully received xxxx  
Hello, I was diagnosed Bipolar I about 8 years ago when I was 23. I was always just depressed and anxious before that and never had mania. I only got diagnosed AFTER I took certain antidepressants (only SSRIs) such as: Lexapro, Zoloft, and Prozac. I would like to know if there is anyone out there who is defintely biploar and has experienced a real manic episode without ever having taken an antidepressant before. I am just wondering if these medications are what trigger my mania. Currently I"m taking mood stabilizers, but usually they make me depressed so I need to be careful with them and not take too much. I am doing ok for now but need to be careful because when stressful things happen, I get very depressed. Thank you for your help. 
Hi All, I need some advice and guidance and I hope I have come to the right place.    I met my gf on Nov 2014 and things were great for the first month and a half and it started to gradually become worse.  Her patience for me started dropping quite drastically and towards the end of the relationship, whenever I say something during our altercations, she would snap.  She has walked out of the restaurant on me a few times and hung up, break up with me more than I can remember.  I think its almost a weekly / bi weekly occurance.    Now I know our relationship is on rocky grounds and there was a fair bit of argument.  Most of them (90%) would just be me trying to defend myself when I have been wrongly accused.  For example, she told me we should take a trip to somewhere for the long weekend and I said okay and proceeded to take leave on Monday so it became a long weekend. When I told her about it and asked if she had taken her leave, she got instantly defensive and said I had not planned anything.  I told her I couldn't make any reservations because I didnt know if she can take any leave.  She then proceeded to tell me that her company does not allow people to take leave before Australia Day (Tuesday) and after that she started saying I heard wrongly.  There are lot of incidents like this whereby she would simply throw everything back in my face.  Sometimes I just keep calm about it and other times I try to get my poin across but it always end up with her getting angry and hanging up on me, or just walking off.    She is also a very controlling person whereby she would get angry whenever I do something she doesnt like, e.g playing games (20 mins) or playing with my phone (even though she is on the phone almost exclusively).  She broke up with me about 3 weeks ago and had blocked me for about 1.5 weeks.  We had some email correspondence whereby she sent a barrage of messages with personal attacks about me.  She asked me to go kill myself several times and also told me that she hopes I get hit by a car.  I did send her flowers after that and she unblocked me and thank me for the flowers.  We had a very flat line conversation and she told me that its over and I should move on.  I told her I was sorry and I'd like to make it up to her.  After about 8 hours she replied telling me she's free that night so I asked her if we could catch up and she said she wanted to go watch a movie.  Within a span our 30 mins she said she didnt want to go so I said okay that she can just rest for the day.  The next day thinking that we might be able to reconcile, i sent her a message asking what her plans are for the day and she wrote back saying it's over, she doesnt want to see or hear from me, doesnt want to have anything to do with me.  I said again then I am sorry for whatever I have done in the relatioship and I would try harder.  9 hours later she would just message me asking me if im there.  We had a quick chat and left it there.  The next day I asked her to come over for dinner (Chinese New Year Eve) and she agreed to come over.  The night went quite well and she mentioned that if she didnt have to work the next day she would stay.  She also said she will be back in the next few days.  The following day I told her i had to drop something off but she said she didnt want to see me but then later she said its okay to come drop it off.  When i got there, I gave it to her and asked if we could have a chat, she got angry and said its over.  We talked about 5 mins before she went back home. That night she sent me a message again telling me to dissapear from her life and that she likes someone else, said she doesnt like me and never will.  She said she hated me and then proceeded to block me.  I just wanted to know that a few days before she broke up with me, we were even discussing marriage, we went to look at wedding rings, checked out real estate sites for houses etc.  I am just perplexed by the sudden shift in her behaviour and even more alarming was after I sent her flowers, she unblocked me and her mood went back and forth.  During our relationship together, she would often tell me she feels hopeless, sometimes about the relationship, sometimes about her life, sometimes about her job.  I havent really took much notice until recently.  I wanted to know if a person has bipolar, does it only affect relationship or will it affect other aspects as well ?  I don't really hang out with her friends so I don't know that side of things but I do know she has altercations with people at work, the building manager where she lives in.  I'd like to help her if she really has bipolar.  Though we've broken up I still care deeply for her. 
Hi guys! I've been diagnosed with Bipolar I disorder after months of depressive episodes and now a major manic phase which i am still experiencing (6 weeks).  Just wondering what people's experience may be after taking Aripiprazone (15mg) and Zopiclone (7.5mg) daily. Tonight is my first night and sort of expected the Zopiclone to take effect immediately as its a sedative but i'm still fully alert after taking it 5 hours ago.   I was prescribed Duloxetine (60mg) and Trazodone (100mg) per night before this and they both worked wonders but that was before I swung into this manic phase.  Any advice would be great!  Thanks LeeLee   8) 
Hello everyone ive recently had a breakdown and been diagnosed with hypomania bipolar ive suffered a lot of abuse all my life and im doing good to still be here. im hoping i can find others to talk too who suffer with this condition or similar. many thanks for reading. 
My partner says im paranoid. Im aware its a possibility, so I'm trying to fight my thoughts. My belief that hes cheating stems from about a year ago, 20 weeks pregnant, when he was hiding his phone screen when I came near and getting messages all through the night. Fast forward to now, and i  am obsessing over it. There's other stuff too, but tbh I'm at a point where whether he has or not, I need to stop, for my own health.   All day I've been battling intrusive thoughts and body hate and I feel like I'm going to implode. I don't know how to stop, or cope. Im trying mindfulness etc, but the feelings are too intense.    Anyone been through this? How did you make it stop? Im bp2 (i think bp1, but I rarely see my cpn or psychiatrist due to staff shortages and only diagnosed Nov), and have PTSD. I'm titrating Lamotragine, 100mg atm 
Hi my names allison and im 31 ive been diagnosed with ocd and panic disorder ive never gotten a reason for a ongoing issue that ive suffered for the last 7 years about every 6 months or so i get this strange sensation out of nowhere were my mind feels like its going so fast and my mind feels really loud im not hearing voices but more like my thoughts i guess,  its that crowded in my mind it sounds like a very busy restaurant like all talking at the same time and it becomes very loud I dont hear this out side my mind its always in my mind and I don't see it as hearing people talking its more a sensation this feeling can last up to an hour ill have it maybe for a month and it goes away for months and months.  Ive asked my doctor and he has no idea he said its not psychosis asim not having any other symptoms and this has gone on for many years and not developed into anything more.  I do suffer from migraine so I don't no if this may be an aura type thing im being sent to a neurologists but I cant find any information about migraine doing this all that I can find that relates to my symptom is bipolar does this sound like bipolar .  Ill mention i dont get depressed or extremely high moments so im at a lose can any one relate  
Hi  Am thinking of going on the anti psychotic aripiprazole. Has anybody taken this drug for bi polar? and how did you get on with it? Was on rispiridone but couldn't cope with the side effects. 
What came first the symptoms or research on WebMD?  Do you know when your looking at possible problems and you are so desperate to find answers that you think you have all the symptoms that are listed and you end up thinking that you have something that will kill you tomorrow? Obviously this is slightly exaggerated but hopefully you get the idea.  ((So this is probably just screaming attention seeking and all that behaviour that people percieve falsely. "Why would someone be so insensitive to almost mock those who do genuinley have that?" But is it intentional, is it unconsiously or is it even done at all? For example when most people harm themselves and don't hide it, is this with the intention of screaming out for help? Or is it just unthought about and purely impulsive? I don't understand but I do want to try to.))  So is it that people accentuate their symptoms to finally have an answer or to feel like they fit the list the doctor has infront of them? Maybe people do acctually want something wrong with them, for a number of different reasons? I honestly do not know.  I often worry that this is the case for me, eventhough I have tried to hide everything from anyone I care about until actually this week. I was terrified that someone would find out and judge me or change how they behave towards me, that I would go to extremes to hide anything I didn't see as the normal behavour. This included all the episodes of depression where I would end up pushing away the people who I thought might find out. Which clearly didnt help the situation.  However recently I did talk to one person who has know the past three years of what I've been going through and she tried to reasure me that I'm not attention seeking, that I was being very honest to myself and everyone else. She also made the point that by looking at symptoms, I might have not even realated to it, I might have finally noticed them in myself. But how can she be sure if I'm not even sure myself? Of course this begs the question are the symptoms even real, coul they all just made up in my head?   I know this is silly but I just feel that honesty when its annoymous is so much easier. Even if these discussions are like a personal blog to just write the random things I think about and even if it is only me then atleast I can know that. 
My daughter was diagnosed with bipolar just over 2 yrs ago and spent 5 weeks in hospital after having her 1st manic episode, the last 2 yrs she has been in and out of hospital and it has been 2 yrs of hell not only for her but also for me as her mother. Just wondered if there are any other mothers who find this illness difficult to cope with?? My daughter is currently in hospital and was sectioned last week for 28 days, although she is not in a secure locked ward and has run from there twice this week! My daughter is normally very caring,  and thoughtful, but she seems very angry at the world and at me, and all i,ve ever done is be there for her, i can't seem to do right from wrong!!!  
Im having a crisis, I feel like no one understands me and feel like I got no support from anywhere. I suffered from depression since I was 19 I'm 40 next week , 2 years ago diagnosed bi polar, cannot get on with medication, suppose to be taking quietapine up to 150 was previously on 600 but felt like a zombie, was off long term sick but now been back a few months and feel like I can't cope any more, only medication I'm taking now is venlafaxine, have a unsupportive boyfriend who is very immature and selfish, all my friends and people at work either don't understand my moods, I think it's more like personality disorder as my moods can change from one extreme to another in a matter of minutes, just sick of it all 
Does anyone else get manic around the holidays? Mine usually starts right before Thanksgiving till about a week or so after Christmas. I take meds like I suppose to it just seems to happen every year 
Hi, just went back to work after being in hospital, following psychosis. Am on aripiprazole 30mg and lithium 1000mg. Feel doped up and wondered if anyone else takes an antipsychotic and works. My doc said over time he would reduce the dose, but until then high dose. Am lucky the guys at work are really good, which helps. 
My sister has had 10 treatments so far.  Monday - Wed - Fri, and is now starting just once a week for a month.  The side effects scares us so much.  She's been pretty foggy, displays alot of confusion.  My sister's Dr.  keeps reassuring us these symptoms will go away.  It is just so hard to see her like this.  Will I get my sister back ??  She is 44 and is bipolar.  
MY partener is showing signs of bipolar and even has manic episodes, this has been ongoing for years it started off as depression but it has just escalated into something even worse, he even now has manic episodes and when really down even thinks about suicide. he has been to the doctors but finds it hard to discuss this personal issue to them, how should he do it and what should he say, he always needs my support and i cannot see him acting in this way any more. 
Hi all,  This is a bit of niche post, looking for people with comorbid Bipolar and Borderline to come forward!  I have both BPD and BD as a formal diagnosis. Has anyone here with this diagnosis found the the symptoms of Borderline get worse during Bipolar depressive episodes? How much or how little impact does the Bipolar cycle have on your moods? The reason I'm asking is I've found that, when I'm depressed, my EUPD goes haywire, and is practically impossible to live with, whereas when I'm in a hypomanic or stable phase, my BPD symptoms are transient and at times not even there!?  Has anyone else has this happen to them? Please feel free to share any experiences you have had if you share the same diagnosis as me. I'm reaching out at the moment because I'm currently in a Bipolar low, and my BPD symptoms are making my life pretty much intolerable! I can't even make it out of the door at the moment with my anxiety, and I find myself feeling overwhelmed and wanting to self harm on practically a daily basis.   I'm currently taking Lithium 1000mg and Quetiapine 150mg, the latter of which seems to be doing sweet nothing. The lithium however has been awesome!   Thanks guys.  
Just had my bipolar upgraded to schizoaffective disorder by my doctor, due to another psychotic episode. Am now taking ability 30mg and lithium been increased to 100mg. I go back to work on Monday, but am drowsy in the morning. Anyone else work on antipsychotics? Has been a tough few years, last chance at work. 
I have Bipolar 2. I'm giving up on the NHS. Fortunately I can afford private within limits. I moved back to the UK three years ago from Australia and befor ethat the US. In both places I had much better mental health care than here.   Right now I need to make some meds adjustments - lithium and effexor have started to give me bad side effects. I'm off the lithium and on to depakote but I still need to change from effexor. The latter is tough to do and I need some team support. My experience with the NHS has been uniformly bad. I had a very poor and borderline incompetent psychiatrist on one visit and have had two failed attempts to get a referral accepted recently. Suicidal ideation is a problem for me but that doesn't appear to get more traction.  On my latest attempt to get a referral accepted, I've been calling Delamere House in Crewe attempting to contact a person I talked to two weeks ago. Yesterday, I made 27 phone calls trying to find her.   Now I'm considering going to the Priory. Are there any experiences that people can share? Did you get good treatment?  Thanks,  Tim 
 Hi all,  Some of you might know me from my previous posts, regarding my own mental health battles.  An update : I'm getting there, I'm regularly seeing someone at a mental health centre so I'm keeping positive!  Now... I started a new job, which is great. One of the girls (let's call her Megan) I know from previous years and I was surprised when I saw she worked I the same office.  She was known for being a manipulative liar (basically twisting things to suit her and lying to others to turn people against each other).  I'm very open about my mental health, as I hope it will at least help a few people to forget the stigma.  Megan then told me she has bipolar, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder.  A few things have stuck out to me that don't make sense...  1) she is only on one medication, Lamotrigine, and says she might be put into Lithium too.  2) we live in the same town and she has commented on going to the same centre as me, however she says she can only go upon referral (she was already referred), and in my experience once I'd been referred I didn't have to see my GP again as they would keep in touch regularly  3) she has told me and another girl that she is slightly going off the rails again, but refuses our help. I've even suggested that we go together to the centre but she quickly back tracked saying they wouldn't remember her - surely they'd keep patient records for a certain length of time?  4) she says she refuses to see her GP about other meds that might help her, but she must see her GP enough to pick up her prescription and review her Lamotrigine?  I need help understanding because I'm taking it badly that someone could lie about this. Why would they? It's all awful to live with!  Any words of experience and advice? (I've tried asking her questions which she wouldn't know but she ignores me and will respond once she has researched, sounding like a wiki page!!!) 
Hi all,  Has anyone here found that cognitive functioning (i.e. ability to learn information, retain facts, mental processes etc.) was reduced by your Bipolar Disorder?  The reason I ask is this. Since I began a treatment on Lithium, I've found I'm able to think far more clearly, learn new things, and remember remarkably large amounts of information in a whole new way. After years of thinking of myself as 'stupid', I did an IQ test last night and scored much higher than I did 3 years ago, when my Bipolar was undiagnosed and I wasn't on medication. Has anyone else found similar? I'm really excited to be able to learn new things far more clearly, and both me and my therapist are convinced this is due to Lithium 'clearing up' my brain a bit, if you'll forgive the term!   Thanks all- any thoughts and comments would be greatly appreciated! 
I really need some advice as to whether I could be bipolar or something else mentally. I will start to say I suggest bipolar first as my nan was bipolar and also had postpartum psychosis to the extent she was locked in a mental institution for 3 years after birth of my mother. My mum has suggested to family members she feels I am similar. My brother also seemed like me and had a serious of mental problems living a reckless life that resulted in a tragic death aged 25. Neither of has been diagnosed professionally only on the coroner trial it was said he had insomnia at the time.  Ive always had depressive moods then suddenly life gets back on track im really happy and doing loads of exciting stuff then back depressed again where I will sleep endlessly. I am not self harming but I do have suicidal thoughts of being better of dead. I have spells of severe anxiety that control my life to a extent its almost impossible to live normally. First shortly after my brothers death I was convinced I was going blind from regular bulbs in the home and sunlight.  This resulted in me sitting in darkened rooms at all times with just small lamps on and curtains drawn. At the time my child was one year old. I made him live like this also as fear he would be blinded. This went on for nearly a year. My next anxiety struck of asbestos I was terrified of it and couldn't stand any kind of dust as I was sure it had asbestos in. Spent all day and night obsessing over it. This somewhat died down but not completely. Next I was convinced I had hiv i lived scared i couldnt let my child drink from same cup all had seperate cutlery months later I made my partner take a hiv test as I was so scared of the result myself. I then had my second child. 3 weeks later I was back to asbestos again. I locked me and kids in bedroom for 4 days only taking small trips to bathroom etc using masks on faces. I thought my whole house was contaminated to the extent I threw nearly my whole household goods including washing machine etc away snd brought new stuff. Im still going through this stage of anxiety I spend all my time googling and no matter how much reassurance I get I am back to the same way shortly after. Its literally controlling my life that I am freaking out at any kind of dust I see sectioning of places in house needed to be throughly cleaned. I know it seems irrational but I just cant stop. Im depressed at moment I am not socialising and feel generally down. All this I have told my gp. I am on 150mg sertraline. I just feel numb I cant cry even though I want to and I am still anxiety. Its currently 4am in morning and im awake worrying and googling even though I know I have to be up early. Just everyday is  constant battle with my mind. I just don't feel normal and feel I have something seriously wrong with me but dont know how to approach my healthcare provider as I feel noone is taking me seriously and just giving me pills which I don't think are working as they should.  Sorry if this is long just looking for any advice and whether my behaviour sounds like bipolar.

[color=indigo:37cc28ba05][/color:37cc28ba05] :? I was just wondering if anyone out there is on the same combination of drugs as me?  At the moment I am taking Depakote 2000mg a day,  Venlafaxine 225mg a day and Seroquel 75mg a day.  I have been diagnosed with everything under the sun but still query wether medication works.  Since my late teens (20 odd yrs ago) I have had episodes of so called depression.  My latest psych thinks that I possibly have a form of bipolar.  During my latest episode I was having extreme fits of  :x frustration/ :evil: anger/ :twisted: violence hence all the meds.  Start with Venlafaxine,  add in Depakote and now the Seroquel.  I must admit though since starting the Seroquel I haven't felt like flying off the handle.    I'm interested to hear from anyone else on any of the above drugs. L &amp; S :devil: screamin :? 
My married daughter was diagnose as borderline bipolar last year. After a turbulent marriage - husband left the marital home one year ago and even though a divorce is imminent this year she still insists on putting a brave face on things. We as a family have made sure that she knows we are here for her and to listen and help her through the hard timesâ¦ but and itâs a big BUTâ¦ I think she is doing a little (a lot) of play acting in desperation of getting a bit of sympathy and understand from her children.  1 - She goes out of her way to scatter objects all over the floor and says she has been busy. (I know a symptom of bipolar) 2 - When her children have come home after work they have found her on the floor pretending to be a sleep. First few times they were shocked and upset thinking something awful had happened to their mum rushing to check her pulse; where she then suddenly wakes up and acts as though she had just fallen asleep. Followed by a worried phone call from grandchildren asking what they should do. Now after seeing how she miraculously wake up saying âI must have fallen asleepâ they have just started to ignore her and leave her alone until she decides to move herself. 3 - Because this isnât causing the children to react the ways she is wanting my daughter has taken to switching the washer on at 1-2am or playing music loud just to let her children know that she is awake?  When they have come out of their bedrooms and asked for her to try and be a little quieter as they have to be up for work they are then on tenderhooks that she will blow-up and start shouting. 4 - The new thing now is jogging ((at 10.30pm)) - Waking her children up  first to let them know she is going out so they want worry! - Which means they cannot sleep until she is home safely. - My daughter hates jogging!  What I want to now is are these symptoms of Bipolar or is my daughter playing a silly game?    
Hi over the last 2 years I have been experiencing problems with the place where I recieve my care as an out patient has any one else been experiencing problems to ? such as failure to provide care when you are in crisis,false records written about you or care provided to you? 
Hi, I'm aware that Bipolar requires a professional diganosis but I am  struggling to get my boyfriend to consider seeing a doctor at the moment. He has suffered with depression and social anxiety for years but this has now led me to thinking he may have bipolar. I know two people who have this condition but it presents itself in very different ways for both of them so not sure if my boyfriend fits the symptoms?  He has low mood much of the time at the moment, feelings of low self worth, little interest in doing things he enjoys, not eating well, not wanting to see people, poor sleep routine, no interest in sex  Other times he can be okay, feeling good about the day ahead, laughing, joking etc and some times very good, singing, being very productive etc (rare at the  moment) but I wouldn't say ever manic.  He can be quite manipulative and often make me feel that things are my fault. He expects my mood to be in sync with his so if he is happy he is annoyed if I am not. (This may occur when he has had a low mood and been not very nice to me, snappy etc)  He has low tolerance to stress so gets very annoyed/angry about stuff especially things he can't really change for example not liking his boss. Often he has quit jobs in the past because he didn't like the management, thought people were dishonest etc which has put us under financial strain.  He is not very good with money handling, much better these days but when we got togther he has been in debt, maxed out credit cards etc.  He has very definate thoughts about stuff, some negative and some positive, for example buying a lottery ticket and being dissapointed he didnt win because he really thought he might (people describe him as an eternal optimist) or bad stuff  currently we have been discussin having children but he thinks that because he is older (44) and works with children with disabilities that the baby will be disabled.   He is very intelligent but often overthinks things. He is a pefectionist and gets annoyed with others who don't keep to his high standards.  He has had a few significant traumatic events happen in his life (not sure if that would have an impact) he has also used drugs recreationally in the past and had a daily cannisbis smoking habit for many years, although this stopped a few years ago. He also used to play sport (Rugby league) every week for most of his life but stopped this a few years ago and says he struggles not having an outlet for his adrehalin anymore.  Any thoughts on whether these are bipolar type behaviours would be appreciated.  Thankyou, frustrated girlfriend! 
A couple of weeks ago I had a manic episode and one of the "brilliant" decisions I made was stopping all of my meds cold turkey.  I held the belief that I was doing good,  however on Monday night I had a complete break down and became suicidal. My nine year old heard my crying and ranting and came to try to console me.  Despite the fact that I hate myself even more for allowing my daughter to be subjected to the dark aspects of this disease,  her being their helped me calm down.  Since then I have still been in a deep depression without suicidal thoughts but I want to quit feelings this way so I was going to restart my meds.  My concerned father wanted me to make sure it was safe to restart my meds because of the high doses I normally take so i tried to get a hold of my psychiatrist,  who is unfortunately on vacation.  His assistant recommends that I go to the hospital and be admitted for observance because I have a lot of other health issues. I don't want to go to the hospital but I need to start my meds again. Should I bite the bullet and go in?  
Hi. I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for some time now. I just feel as though something else is a miss. Something is not quite right.  Could anyone suffering with Bipolar 2 disorder tell me what sort of symptoms I'd expect if I had this particular disorder? I don't have bipolar 1 as I'm not manic enough. Hoping someone can be descriptive in shedding some light. Thank you. 
I was depression about 1 month ago and never take any anti depressent and I don't have bipolar. But now I feels changed mood energy and something new discovered since few weeks ago until now then difficult fallen asleep and last night I was feel jumpy and anxiety too, but now I am normal and bit headache and I have yawn and faitgue sometimes.  Am I Full Blown Mania illness or Hypomania? Should I take medication now?  What happens if no long take any medication? 
head's gone and going, hands shaking, mind racing, here we go a-boring-gain ...this is the worst time of year for me and others, always has and will be. another messed-up year in my memory; another chaotic year starting; the pseudo-celebration of xmas and all the previous annual xmas horrors it reminds of; the feeling that you just fell off the end of the world into a dark cold noisy mega-hole (yes I'm in a northern english city); seasonal affective disorder doesnt quite capture it, this is unreasonable defective disorder, and lately I've been getting tired of waking up and trashing the room and breaking things I didn't meant to because I just don't know what I'm feeling at this time of the year and by NYE I will be so frantic and liminal my mind will go minimal, just keep away from bars and people and all those smiley faces slobbering 'happy new year' like it actually really honestly means something haha. hands tooo shaky now andd forgot what I wanted to say, but someone out there might just see the light of 2015 before it fades - there it goes!¬: know it lasts long, many endings.... 
I have been getting ECT to treat my bipolar symtoms for over a year. I have been on every medication you can imagine and nothing seems to stop or control my symptoms. My family and friends do their best to be supportive but they don't understand how it feels to hate yourself so much you can't get out of bed, then feel like you can do anything which always causes more pain, regret and guilt. I quit all treatment two weeks ago without anyone knowing and admittedly I have felt my mental health deteriorate but I can't get myself to start taking my medicine or go back for ECT because I was still struggling. I don't know what to do and feel so alone because I have no one who can truly understand the pain I'm in. I'm losing control and don't know what to do.  
Got diagnosed with bipolar when I was about 13-14.  I'm now 20. I've disrespected the most important people around me with my mood swings and rude hateful unthoughtful actions and comments. I was on abilfy but at the age of 16-17 I stopped taking it not to mention the fact that it made me horribly sleepy to where I would doze off in classes and what not. My daddy would tell me how different I would act when I'm on my medicine. I go through extreme depression especially with  the place that I'm at now ,  never felt so alone in life. I push & drive everyone away with my actions and words .. Except my daddy & my boyfriend but those seem to be the ones that I hurt the most. I scream and yell and throw things when I don't get my way . My daddy does everything he possibly can to make me happy and I just act so shitty towards him but if I was to ever lose him I KNOW I wouldn't be able to go on with life ..,  so why am I so rude and Loud and angry towards him  ?   I say the most hateful things to my boyfriend when I get mad .. Things that I know he will never forget . I wanna get back on my medicine but I have to get re evaluated and that takes sometime not to mention I don't have Insurance right now and my daddy already pays for my medicine out of pocket ... I have no clue what to do ., it's like the littlest things that make  me snap I get annoyed at anything .. I just don't think that my actions is what a normal person would do . Where does these type of actions Come from?  My daddy doesn't have any disorders like this ...  And my mother I never got to meet so I can't really put it off on her.  So many questions no answers  Is this normal ? 
Hello, So apart from an old housemate saying they thought I was bipolar, an ex saying I was 'jekell and Hyde' another saying I was sometimes so confident and then sometimes so anxious, quiet and down about myself -flying off the handle etc- I just shrugged this off as me being over sensitive and changable. But to be honest I am now 28 and I do look back at some of my interactions with people and think, why did I do that? why did I say that? I look back at my 2 failed university courses, all my failed jobs, all the times ive moved towns, countries, friends - sometimes feeling that I can do anything and achieve anything, I make grand plans and then become in a pitfall with no money and with nothing when it all comes crashing down. I am highly critical, I have thoughts rushing in my head constrantly - sometimes I get socially anxious, other times I am the opposite. I've had times which last for a long time, when I cannot talk to anyone I feel so lost and alone - nervous, anxious. Other times when I am so confident, happy and feel I am special. Whilst I know humans go through a range of emotions - I know something isnt right. I want to find out if maybe I have bipolar. I have mild dyspraxia which might count for some things but I know something else is going on and i cant take another failed relationship/job and to keep going round in circles down and up until I get to the root of the problem - please any advice would be really appriciated - there have been many incidents/bad situations in my life which have worried me but I havent got help yet - any advice? 
I think these forums are great but I also think they can be slightlly damaging for various reasons.  Not least, that when you find a collection of people all suffering fro similar but not the same mental issues and I would worry that it might hinder a person from getting well.  I am currently trying to recover from a bad spell of aggraphobia, extreme shaking, confusion and a complete lack of productivity in most areas of my life.  As a bipolar person and having had a few bizarre up and down years it gets really tiring trying to stay right.  I haave stopped drinking and done as much as I could to make myself happy but nothing I seem to do works.  Not for any meaningful length of time anyway. I sometimes can't even text because I shake so mauch.  Npow that's not me.  Do you see my typing errors?  That's not me that's the meds.  I sometimes feel unreal and totally dettached from everyone elses world.  Now that can crush a person for sure.  I'm sure all other sufferers would agree.  The thing is the cloud lifts and even if it is momentarily you have got to maximize it's presence for however short a period.  Hold together and fight the urge to submit.  This is an illness that the best medication is within yourself.  It is Patience.  I know how hard it is.  I wish all of you the best of luck and if anyone wants to comment please feel free.

My whole body shakes from lithium. Dr decreased my does today down to 600 mg a day. Does any one know of any essential oils that would help with this until my lithium levels decrease  
Hi all. I recent posted on here regarding bipolar but it upset one particular member. Not intentionally I might add... I've suffered anxiety most of my life. I'm a 38yr old male. This year I have truly experienced proper depression. I also seem to have traits of bipolar. I'm wanting to ask unfortunate sufferers what I'm to expect if bipolar is something I have. How severe do things get? How often? I'm really not educated enough to go to my doctor and say I have this condition. I'm currently on venlafaxine 75mg for depression and anxiety as no other condition has been recognised. Any info would be welcomed. 
I have had many diagnosis ,& have a high moodsbut not lasting weeks ,the highs seem to last a day or hours,but the lows are a lot worse.days weeks.does that mean it's bipolar.??? 
Been unstable since January. Meds work. Not sleeping. Went to psychiatrist today. He changed my sleeping pill to sonata. Any thoughts? He took me down to 300mg of lithium for a month then I stop it. Is it really necessary to wean off lithium?  Took me off adderall. I think that's it. I hope lol 
Hi, I have been prescribed lamotrigine to try and help with my bipolar symptoms, mainly the depressed cycles.  I collected my prescription this afternoon of 56 25mg tablets - Starting on a low dose and slowly increase over coming weeks,  There is a big problem in that I am so afraid of starting taking them after reading all the side effects online especially about the rashes associated with lamotrigine which can turn out very nasty and even fatal!!   Theres also a lot of other side effects which frighten me to death like organ failure, bone marrow problems etc....  Should I begin to take it or refuse it as treament? I have seem many positive reviews with this medication for bipolar but I really don't know if I want to put something so dangerous in my body!  
Hello! I've been on this site for about a month and have dished out plenty of advice, but feeling very hypocritical as haven't had the courage myself to post a question. But here goes now.  Anxiety and depression seems to run in my family. My mum suffers from it BADLY. My auntie and one of my cousins have OCD (mostly to do with cleaning I think). I remember my maternal granny was FOREVER cleaning! My mum used to as well, but that seemed to stop 20 years ago when my dad left. I know my auntie was commited (in her 20's I think, she's now in her 60s) but I don't know what for. She's always been a bit 'daft'! If she is the 'up' sister, my mum is the 'down' one. And I am absolutely positive my mum has some sort of personality disorder, but she has only ever been treated for depression.  So now to me! My problems really only started at the age of 8 or 9 when we moved house and I had to move school. It wasn't far, but felt like another world to me. Anyway, my confidence was really low and I ended up withdrawing into myself and having only a small group of friends and that's probably when I started to become seen as 'strange' or at least 'different', and by high school I felt 'abnormal' and was picked on horribly. Some classes were a complete nightmare. Anyway, to get to some sort of 'point' here...at the age of 9 or 10 I can distinctly remember starting to get compulsive thoughts. Like having to say my favourite band members name over and over in my head. I developed other little OCD type thoughts and actions, which just when I managed to overcome one, another would pop up in its place. Magical thinking was definitely there too. I also started to get those feelings of unreality (out of body type experiences) when I was either pre-teen or just into my teens.  Skipping forward a bit, the summer I left school I went a bit 'weird' for a time. I don't like to say 'manic' but having read a bit about mania/hypomania it was something similar. Then I crashed. Big time. I'd say my anxiety was probably through the roof as well at that time. I never got any help though and it probably took about a year before I felt 'normal' again.  Sorry this is really long!!! I'm only just getting to what I was really needing advice about.  The reason I think I went a bit 'odd' when I left school was I no longer knew what I was meant to do with my life. Prior to that I was set to go to art college. (maybe I should add as it's relevant to what I want to say later...my big dream had always been to work for NASA. But the maths I used to love slipped away from me, and I didn't take physics. In other words...I didn't actively DO anything to fulfill my dream. Infact, as an 'intelligent' girl I left school with far fewer qualifications (and poorer grades) than I should have. Art became my 'escape'...I didn't have to think). Anyway, for various reasons I withdrew my college application. Went 'weird' for a bit. Decided I would do an Office Admin course (since I had done a word processing module at school!). But dropped out of that after a few months. Thought, well I did Biology at school and like that. So did a year long science course at college. Got the modules but couldn't be bothered (!?!) to do the end of course assessment. Managed to get into University through the 'clearing' process to do a Biotech degree (didn't even know what that was!). Scraped through that. Never used it. Had some office jobs. Never stuck at a job for very long. Have gone through last 20 years buying books on umpteen different subjects, and spending money on courses, because I had finally discovered what I wanted to do with my life! History. Classical Studies (this one was because my then husband suggested I open an online shop. I decided on a 'Roman' theme, but for some reason I needed to learn all about ancient Rome first!!!). Religious studies. Art History. Maritime history. Ancient history. Archaeology. Mathematics. Health Science. Philosophy. And most recently I was determined that I had found my calling with Environmental Science and Geology. Bought some books but thankfully didn't sign up for the expensive courses as I got too depressed and lost interest in everything! All that  type of stuff happens when I am feeling more 'normal'. I make plans. Start of this year for example...signed up to paid online course to learn Swedish. Bought the DVD that helps you pass your driving theory. Watched it all and went through all the questions. Told everyone I was going to take the Theory test, then get driving lessons again. Was looking for a job. Was going to lose weight...started eating really well. Bought the books I needed for my 'studies' and was going to start making lots of notes.  Well...yep...none of that done! Started. Then abandoned. Most things abandoned really. Stopped listening to music. Stopped reading. Got lower and lower. But I'm only now starting to see a pattern in this. I do this type of thing all the time. It's never been any different. And I think it's getting worse. I recently turned 40 and the thought that I haven't achieved anything keeps sending me into a blind panic. I also seem to make pointless lists (I've just realised this!) I'll spend hours (days/weeks!)working out my favourite songs or painters and listing them. Days looking for the perfect holiday that I'll never go on. When we had a new kitchen done I spent practically all day every day for weeks and weeks obsessing about every little detail. Looking at kitchen parts online and using 'design' applications. Meanwhile, no dishes done, no washing done, place a mess. Dinner late.   Sorry, just a couple more things to add.  I've just realised something else I do. When I have those times where I seem to be more confident and want to do stuff, I also gets burst of energy where I have to clean the whole flat (as usually it's an effort to even pick up that tissue that's been on the floor for a week) and tidy out cupboards. But I'll start and then get caught up doing one thing, and the rest gets left! Like, this year I remember tidying out a big hall cupboard of sheets and bedding. Threw stuff out. The rest was scattered in piles on my bedroom floor. Then I realised I didn't have suitable storage bags to put everything in. So left it all there and spent hours on amazon choosing the nicest storage bags. Then had to wait for them to arrive before I could finish my 'tidying'! That's something else I seem to do. Start a task...then get horribly sidetracked.  If anyone has bothered to read this far I am so eternally grateful!  There are other things too which I guess are similar to social/general anxiety. But they seem to 'cycle' with my moods. I don't think they go away completely, but are much less of a problem when I'm not feeling very low.   I've always just been treated for anxiety and depression. Maybe that really is all that I suffer from. But I've never told any doctor about most of what I've written above. I started to a few weeks ago, but just the OCD type stuff as a child and the fact that having a job is hard for me (I find it very stressful, which sounds pathetic). But I made such an arse of myself I'm having a hard time plucking up the courage to tell her the rest of it. At times I think it's important. Other times I think 'oh stop being so silly'! But I'm starting to realise that these things really have caused pretty major problems in my life.  SO, before I go back to her and make a fool of myself...does anyone here think they are just anxiety symptoms or could it be 'something else'. I don't feel like I get hypomanic, as I don't seem to get 'energised'...I'm always tired! But I do have a couple of other health problems that don't help with that. But my thoughts can get very 'heightened' to the point where I feel my brain will explode. That can go on for weeks and weeks. But I think that's maybe because I get really anxious about something. I just don't know! I can't switch it off. The more I try to rationalise, the worse it gets, and my thoughts get caught up in endless loops.  Oh, well anyway, I'll stop rambling on. If anyone wants to reply - -thank you!!  Oops...forgot...I also 'childlessly' get fixated on say a band, or a singer, and watch hours worth of videos on you tube...and get nothing else done. Then when my fixation wanes and I think WTF!!?    
I take 100MG of lamictal which is working great for me. My moods are stable, but I have really bad social anxiety. So my psychiatrist prescribe me Zoloft. (25MG) My question is has anyone had weird side effects with taking Zoloft? I'm just a little stressed because some of the reviews I've read. Say that you get over the top manic moods. Any knowledge you have would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!  
I have recently been diagnosed as bipolar type 2. Not surprising as it runs in my family, and after assessing my life it paints a clear picture. My question isn't necessarily about the way it affects my mood specifically, but more so other aspects of my life.   Long before I was diagnosed I've always viewed my life as an inconsistent shift of different phases. I understand it is normal for people to enjoy doing something short term and then become bored of it,, but is this more common for people affected by this mental illness? There are certain hobbies I am very passionate about, writing being my main example. Though no matter how much I enjoy something or how much I want to work on a project, I can never seem to keep at it. It always feels so inconsistent. It has always been like that. I can never stick to something no matter how much I want or need to do it. II desire so much to continue writing, I have so many ideas, but can never bring my self to do it. I mostly just want more information on if the feeling that everything is just moving from one phases to another randomly is a result of being bipolar and if there are tips or ideas to make it seem less frustrating. This sort of information I find very valuable as I assess things and move forward.  
Hi  I wonder if anyone has had ECT for bi polar. I really can't tolerate antipsychotics due to side effects and wonder if I should give ETC ago. Has anybody any experience of this? 
Good-morning!  I have recently started Abilify 7.5 mg in two divided doses (I take 5mg in the morning and 2.5mg in the evening). In the past I have suffered from severe depression possibly Bipolar Disorder but I have not yet been fully diagnosed.  My moods have improved greatly with the Abilify, I feel more like myself than I have felt in years.  I usually do not suffer any bad side effects and tolerate newly introduced drugs well....however I also take Lyrica 75mg bid, and have found my mind to be cloudy and I often feel "spaced out". I find this very concerning as I have a family and household to take care of.  I do not like my children seeing me like this!  Has anyone else had similar experiences?  Will these side effects improve as my body tolerates the drugs better?  Any help or suggestions would be appreciated!  I should add I am 42 years old and currently a stay at home mom (though I am a registered nurse), I have been unable to work for the past five years due to my mental illness and physical limitations (back injury and Degenerative Disc Disease, two central disc herniations at L3-4 and L4-5). Thanks!   
Hi, I was diagnosed with bipolar back in July of this year. Incase treated for PND before hand from the January. Anyway I was on sertraline 150mg and Mirtazapine 30mg which saw me gain 20lbs, I've been off the Mirtazapine now for nearly 6months and I am struggling to even shift a pound. I've tried clean eating, low carb diets, weight watchers even restricting and nothing. It is really dragging me down and I feel like a hopeless fat mess. I'm currently on lamotrigine 150mg and diazepam (only some days)   Anyway has any body had a similar experience where by they eventually lossed the mirtazapine weight?  
Hi. I've suffered from anxiety most of my life and managed it fairly well. This march I experienced depression for the first time in my life. It's torture. Although it lifts now and again, I'm scarred to what it's done to me and how it's made me turn out. I take venlafaxine 75mg for this although I think I need to increase to the next dose.  I am however thinking that I may be bipolar. I do suffer from some trates of bipolar although I'm actually unsure how to define these trates as bipolar trates or just a bit of what normal folk experience. I'm a 38 yr old guy. I have a girlfriend and no real worries but I get sexual urges. I look at prostitutes but never actually do anything about it. I masturbate nearly everyday and this seems to lift my mood and fix my sexual turn on. These are trates of bipolar but the other trates don't usually bother me. I have a short fuse. Not violent but lose my temper and get really stressed. I don't go on mad spending sprees but I have made a few financial errors in the past. Are these normal trates that have just gone wrong or should I be thinking I have bipolar?? No one in my family suffer from it.  I'd like to know how to define some bipolar trates as in the word excessive is used a lot. Any suggestions would be welcomed. 
I've had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder for the last ten years.  I struggle with hearing voices.  My mood seems fine at the moment but the voices are really loud and intrusive and I wonder if anyone has any tips for dealiing with them?  They're beginning to interfere with my daily life - I'm struggling to sleep and concentrate on anything.  I saw my GP yesterday and he gave me some temazepam which helped with the sleep but the voices are still just as loud. I don't want to use the temazepam too much as it's addictive.  The crisis team won't help me as I don't want to kill myself therefore they don't class it as a crisis.  The voices do tell me to harm myself and I know that doing that would quieten them but I really don't want to do that.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks 
Hi  Am thinking of going on the anti psychotic aripiprazole. Has anybody taken this drug for bi polar? and how did you get on with it? Was on rispiridone but couldn't cope with the side effects and was like a zombie. 
my psychiatrist told me to keep a mood diary for her to look through, and when i said that i keep a diary of everything anyway she said not one like that.. but i cant remember what she said to include in it.. she did say to number how i feel from one to ten..  i dont want to ramble on if she wantd the bare minimal  have you been asked to keep one? and what do you write in it? just a brief explanation of your mood that day? or just a number?  
I know this sounds kinda silly because I'm bipolar but, im really tired of been in this rollercoaster without control for so long. Ive tried different psychiatrist, psychologist, medication, psych hospitals, group therapy, ECT and nothing help for more than 3 months,  Now Ive been near 3 months in this horrible crisis (suicidal ideation/thoughts/attempts, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, irritability, worthlessness, hopelessness, crying spells, self-harm...).  I feel physically and emotionally tired of everything and everybody. Nothing helps. Increasing, decreasing, discontinuation of meds and new ones. And the cycle again and again... It does not want to stop!  My family is tired of me and my crisis, My few friends are too. Nobody can understand me.  It's 12:25am and Im waiting that my roomate fall asleep to go out of the apartment and walk. Yes,in the middle of the night.  I wish if someone could drive me to the hospital because I cant bear this anymore. There's no public transportation at this hours and my roomate has no gas on his van nor money. Neither do I. And he also has severe insomnia and it seems he is sleeping (after 4 nights...). I dont want to bother anybody, ANYMORE... 
Am fed up, stopped taking rispirdone 4 months ago and have just got back to myself again, but have low level voices again. I am bi polar and hated being on an anti psychotic, but have put myself back on 0.5mg which is making the voices quieter. Just wanna be me ole self again. Had a really hard and long withdrawal from it, but Don't wanna end up in hospital again. 
Hi has anyone heard of sacre nerve  Stimulation for overactive bladder  Treatment. ??? 
Hi, I suffer from rapid cycling bi polar disorder, and I'm waiting for blood test results to come back before they'll start me on Lithium. The problem I'm having at the moment is that I'm self medicating nearly every night with alcohol, it's the only thing that seems to keep me stable, I know it's not good for me, but I was wondering if anyone else out there does this, or understands it?  
I started doing yoga, meditating and even converted to Buddhism within the past 2 months. I have felt amazing. Stable. Just seen through Dr.everything was good until the past week. At night when I try to sleep I actually feel someone or something massaging my feet gently.  I'm not a believer in god,ghost or the supernatural. But I instantly thought it was my dad who past away 5 yyrs ago. My husband says my Adderall is making me have hallucinations. I'm suppose to take seroquel at night but I dont. Maybe I should stop. What if I take it and nothing changes? He also said my happiness and positive attitude has gone away too 
hello I am just after other people's experiences on severe anxiety with bipolar and how they treat this! I am very frustrated as my mood is elevated but I have severe anxiety and agitation. I don't feel as though my mental health team are taking me very seriously. Every time I see my cpn or psychiatrist or senior clinical pharmacist I am telling them that the anxiety is becoming unbearable and is seriously affecting my everyday life. They have increased my quetiapine dose to help with the high mood but still I have not been given anything to help with my anxiety. All they keep saying is they can't give me any medication for the anxiety in case it makes me high but I would rather be high and have less anxiety than suffer like this. Does anybody have any suggestions? I really wish I had my old psychiatrist still as my new one is rubbish, he doesn't even look at you when you are talking. Any advice welcome! 
I would like some honest input. I was diagnosed with Bipolar I with psychosis. That was 15 years ago. I have been on numerous meds. Starting this past January I started a really bad manic episode that lasted 6 months. I'm on 3 different mood stabilizers, anti depressant, sleeping pill and anxiety meds. After that bad episode I finally decided I was no longer going to let this illness control me like I have all these years. So, I started doing yoga 3x a day. I switch my religion to Buddhism ( which has been awesome) and I meditate anywhere from 3 to 5 times a day. I feel so much better more relaxed and not so angry all the time. What do some of you do to control your illness on top of your meds? Thanks for the input 
Can someone tell me how to stop trembling on lithium as a side affect? My whole body shakes. I can stop 
I'm 27 years old and have suffered from depression my whole life. I have had a very hard life, I attempted suicide when I was 15, I overdosed and almost succeeded, cut my arm up real bad, I still have scars, had rough as a little kid living place to place even in a car at one point, my parents both had their vices dad was an alcoholic and mom was a junkie. I've lost 2 babies, both died in my arms, I nearly died from blood loss. I want to overcome all of this but it haunts me and I feel sad and think about suicide a lot. I just want to feel happy and enjoy a wonderful life with my husband and daughter. I don't want to feel so unmotivated all the time. I need energy! I'm such a numerous person and I feel so suffocated with sadness and I can't control it. I have no one to talk to, everyone says "just get over it or grow up or its your choice to feel that way it's all in your head, quit using your mental illness as a crutch." I just want help. 
I was diagnosed with BP about 6 months ago and I have no idea how to control it, I see my GP sometimes, my psychiatrist just switches off when I talk to him and my CPN just compares me to others, I've tried switching but no luck so far! I'm a single person on my own, I have a daughter but a court order said I'm a risk and she's better off with her dad. I'm literally at the end of my tether because I feel so alone and this is consuming me and I don't know how to deal with it  
 Hi everyone, I thought I'd post this on here too, I don't really know anyone with Bipolar, so it woukd be nice to talk to people who understand.I started 20mg Fluoxetine at the beginning of July and after 2 weeks of horrendous side effects, I feel like I'm coming out the other side but this damn Fatigue is getting me down. I used to be a really athletic on the go kind of person but since all of this, well I'm not.ð  So here are my questions:  1. What symptoms do you experience with your fatigue?  2. How long have you had it?  3. How do you cope with it and stay positive?  4. Do the littlest of activities exhausted you, since having it? But then have outbursts of energy that last for a few minutes. If you know what I mean.  Thank you for taking the time to read my post.   
I am on lamotrigine, after coming off Abilify. Mania is no longer present, psychosis had gone, and depression was not prawns.   Recent I've started smoking weed. I don't know how this interacts with Laamotrigine? Has anyone mixed these two?   I've only had a severe manic episode once (less than a year ago), and I have only ever had psychosis at the height of the mania I've experienced.  I'm not sure if it's the bipolar, but I can feel myself unravelling. The voice I heard 'ben', I'm thinking he's around a lot again. I can't hear him like I used to, but Every now and then I've heard him in the past few weeks, becoming louder. I'm not manic, but I'm starting to feel like people are conspiring against me. I don't feel depressed.    I feel like it can't be a bipolar episode because I'm aware of what is going on.   Is this bipolar or do you think it's weed causing this?  
I have been diagnosed as bipolar for about 23 years now. At first I was severely depressed and suicidal. I has about 3 attempts at first. That was about 2 weeks after I had brain surgery to remove a benign tumor in the right frontal lobe. That created a chemical imbalance in my system. The doctors could not figure me out at first. They put me in the psych ward for a month trying me on various meds to try to alleviate my depression. It wasn't until they tried me on Lithium that my depression lifted. They released me within 5 days and hooked me up with a really good psychiatrist who saw me on a weekly basis for the first few years. I kept seeing her on a regular basis but the depression came back. She gave me a good talking to saying "Stop thinking of yourself as a Victim of the medical profession and think of yourself as a Victor. Look at how many suicide attempts you have survived. You have your whole life to look forward to." WELL, you know what? I changed my outlook on life after that and have not suffered severe depression after that. To be honest I am vulnerable to antidepressants. I have had two psycotic episodes because I was put on too high a dose a couple of times. Now I have to take anti-psychotics. I also find that because of the medication I'm on I find that I am a coffee holic. I can't seem to stay off the stuff. It ruins my sleep paterns. I find myself drinking 6 or 7 cups a day and also find myself staying up until 3 or 4 in the morning. Luckily my body still gives me my 8 hours of sleep. Any else a coffee holic? 
Bipolar I is genetic and Bpolar  II is basically...but not wholely... enviornmental. The deference, therefore is in the control that you do or do not have. Biplor nonspecific is a lighter degree of Bipolar II. Either way do not let yourself be defined bi your illness. Bipolar II  was my first DX. Don't stop there! 
I have lived with my 52 year old GF for about 18 months now.  I am increasingly finding her moods and general behaviour different from whjat I consider "the norm".  Please advise me on whether it is me being uptight or that she possibly may be bi-polar?  Her bahavious changes significantly over a 14  to 16 day cycle - regular as clockwork. âPhase 1 - She is euphoric.  Wants to be everyones friend, regardless of their age - consequently, she has many "aquantancies" she calls friends but really, they are just people she meets once (such as a lumber coming to the house etc).  She laughs loudly at everything. She dances while driving.  She does things around the house with seemingly endless energy.  She is lovable, caring and totally into our relationship during this phase.  She constantly tells me she is "horny" at all times of day and night.  This is the only phase she will come to bed with me at a regular time. âPhase two - she becomes more focused in her actual work - spending hours on the computer.  She watches Netflix movies and won't watch TV with me.  She will say she needs to pick something up at the store (a 30 minute round trip) but will be gone for 2 hours or more - she says she was looking at stuff or bumped into someone who got chatting with her etc.  Even if I offer to go with her, she says no.  She doesn't come to bed until maybe 2 or 3am and will sleep until lunchtime the following day.  âPhase three - the final phase.  Phase two ends very suddenly when I happen to do or say something that ordinarily, is no big deal.  For instance, the lastest episode 3 days ago was that I leaned the vacuum cleaner up against her printer - she want ape.  Screaming  and shouting and then pushing me against the door.  Her face changes from this soft beauty that she can be, into a raging beast.  I calmly ask her to stop shouting - she shouts more and louder without caring who is around.  I always either go for a long walk or close myself in my office for hours on end.  Sometimes (as was the case in this latest episode), she packs up a bag and disappears.  I really don't know where she goes, but she always tells me she goes to her girlfriends (who is not a good influence due to weed and alcohol use).  Sometimes, she tells me she went to a coffee shop and sat for hours watching movies on her laptop.  When she comes back, she will suddenly go "childish" like and say funny little things to me to get my atttention.  Then the first phase starts over.   âShe never wants to talk about what happenned - any attempt to do so, will automatically fast forward to phase  three immediately.  So I now keep my mouth shut.  Some general bahavorial points - she drinks just about every evening - 2 or 3 beers.  Never gets drunk.  But this drinking is regular and even though (to encourage her) I abstain, she goes ahead.  She needs beer in the fridge at all times or she gets antsy.  Having had a 5 year relationship with an alcoholic earlier in my life, I do know that this is a mild form of alcoholism.  When I first met her 2 years ago, she was smoking, by her own admission, about 7 joints of weed a day.  I have never done any drugs, so this was shocking to me.  I give her full credit in that she just about quit apart from when she is together with someone she knows who smokes - she will smoke right with them,.  I also suspect that the reason she goes away so often is so that she can smoke weed more frequently.  She also smokes weed openly with her weed smoking daughter of 33 years.  The majority of her friends, that I have met, seem to be potheads and/or alcoholics - thpough she does have some really nice friends too.  All this sounds terribal, but I am in love with her and my nature is to help people rather than walk away and close my eyes.  How do I address this with her?  How do I get her to at least consult wiith her doctor.  She has told me that she was in a severe depression for a couple of years that ended about 4 years ago. I welcome your comments and advice. Thank you in advance..... 
Before I was first diagnosed with bipolar, I spent 1 year off work going in and out of hospital. I was unable to pay rent and my boyfriend couldn't afford to by himself, so he had to get a house mate and I had to move out.   Finally back at work and moving back in again with my boyfriend. However, I am concerned how we will manage if I'm ever hospitalised again.   Do you have any specific plans with your partner for when you are too ill to work and still need to pay rent?   The rent is around £1000 per month, so paying it by himself isn't doable  
Hi  I was on rispirdone for psychosis and it did work for voices etc, but I found the side effects and numbness awful after getting better. I came off them a month ago and my doctor said I will get ill again, but I can't stand being a zombie. I am bi polar and am taking lithium and citalopram. I just want to be antipsychotics free.  I feel so much better off the rispiridone and have motivation and am interested in stuff again and my sense of humour is back. 
My new GP in a new city won't refer me to a psych to adjust my medication, due to the fact that I refused therapy in my old city.   My bipolar is under control tanks to lamotragine.  However, my PMS is crazy pre-period. So much so it's impacting my relationship (me and my bf ended up very nearly breaking up last month because of this). I also do not want to feel the way I do before my period.   My GP refuses to 'deal with anything relating to my mood'. Today she gave me birth control as a solution to my PMS problems. She told me that birth control with stop lamotragine from working, but she refused to look at an alternative to birth control, gave me the birth control, and told me it was my choice.  I told her I had read that fluoxetine was another PMS solution (I know personally that it comes with risks when bipolar). However again she told me that I had to go see a male Dr, despite me telling her I felt uncomfortable taking about my period with a male Dr (specifically this one).  It appears she is refusing to deal with me based on the fact that last year, I was all over the place.   Does anyone else take lemotragine but suffer from PMS and have you found anything useful?   I am hitting a dead end. Everything in my life is falling apart and I'm trying to hard to keep it together and ask for help, but I feel like the Drs is neglecting their duties. What can I do?? I'm in the UK. I don't know how I can get help.  
Has anyone ever had problems with lithium and restless leg syndrome? I can't keep them still. I have been back on lithium about 2 months 
I have been on lorazepam for about 5 years. It has worked great except for the past couple of years. My memory has gotten really bad. I don't mean I forgot where I put things.  I lose days. More like every day. Sometimes I may beable to remember bits and pieces. So upon loosing my days I have also lost the memories of my past. I have had test run all. Showing not. Any advice would be more than appreciative  
Is having Bipolar disorder make patients lie on a constant basis? But they fully believe what they are saying is 100%true. My brother has bipolar 2 and he never used to lie at all, in fact he was the only one I would trust completely. But as of late he tells stories in company and these stories have completely grown arms and legs and he was at family arguments when he wasn't even there, but he fully believes he was, can this condition be the problem or is there something else going on? I really appreciate any help as this is breaking the family apart. Thanks 
I know this forum is for people with bipolar but i'm so confused that I hope no one minds me asking for advice from people who really know about this illness.?I'll try to be brief. Met my b/f at college , first real love , been together on and off for just under a year. He told all of us at the beginning that he had bipolar as from experience it was easier to do so. He also said his dad had bipolar with complications but didn't mention what they were and none of us felt we could ask at that point [still haven't don't feel its my business].Didnt know anything about the illness but started reading up  when he asked me out . Everything was fine at first but then out of the blue he finished with me,no explanation.But the next morning he texted me and continued to do so all weekend until back at college he asked me out again.This happened a further four times but each time I went back he became progressively more hurtful in what he said to me, accusing me of things he was actually guilty of himself. He ended things again as they didn't feel right he said.He went out with another girl which lasted a week before she finished things as ,in his words he had a major episode and took it out on her. That's the confusing thing; he only ever is episodal with me /girlfriends. He's always fine with everyone else. When I asked him about this he said he didn't know. I thought episodes affected everybody not just select people, have I got it wrong? There was a break and then he got in touch saying he loved me , was trying to sort himself out so we started going out again. But then I started to notice other things; at times his behaviour is childish, for one example ,he sat on a chair thumping the wall and when asked what he was doing he replied, "sulking".He also has to be the centre of attention all the time to the point where if anyone has anything to say he always has done something much wilder and more exciting.He did even say once ,"It was amazing to be the centre of attention, everyone listening to me . It was just brilliant."He also tells [I hesitate to say lies because he clearly believes them] stories; He's been mugged ,stabbed twice, knocked off his bike, attacked by a drunk, knocked unconscious and spent days in hospital,has allergies that leave him unconscious for two days that he forgets about til someone mentions it, has job offers abroad , has injuries that should require surgery but he never needs it and the latest one is a friend's body was found somewhere out in the wilds[ there have been no newspaper reports on this -i feel terrible for even checking up on him but i'll be honest, this one freaked me out a bit].When he talks about things he often repeats what has just been said to him and even says lines out of films and songs as though it were his own  conversation.Just recently he admitted he's never been officially diagnosed as bipolar and as far as i'm aware he's not on any medication [although he did say he stopped taking anti depressants as they didn't help]. So , my question is , is all this consistent with bipolar because I just don't know how to cope with this behaviour anymore. Bipolar is not a problem to me . I accept it as part of who he is and was prepared to stand by and support him but some of this stuff doesn't seem to match  all the info I've read and i'm now seriously confused and feeling very low myself. Can someone please help me understand better? 
Good night everyone! Im new here... Im Wanda. I am 29 and live in Puerto Rico. I was diagnosed as Bipolar Type I at age 15. And on 2009 with Borderline Personality Disorder.  I was forced to moved from my parents house at 22 years and for 7 years I've been living independently. I worked for 7 years as a Medical Billing Secretary at a well recnognized Child and Adolescents Psychiatrist. I left the job on July 16th, 2015 because I want to make a Bachelor's Degree in Biology and then move to Baltimore, Maryland and be admitted at The John Hopkins Medicine School. A little of me...  I start at college on Aug 19th. Im very nervous because i feel worthless, inferior to others, wothout the necessary capacity of a College Student... But my passion always been medicine (Specially Emergency Medicine). And Im very good at med terminology and procedures! (Reading and watching TV and internet program medical based).  Since I enter High School I started feeling inferior, even though I always had excellent grades. The Bipolar Disorder came to make a disaster of my life. I dont believe in me, in my potential... Nobody believes in me. Have been psych hospitalized for about 45 times. And a lot more suicide attempts. I cut myself. Two hours before I did it in various parts of my body because Im desesperate. Can't sleep. My rommate sold my hypnotics (narcotics) and my anxyolitics too.  I want him to go out of my house. He has been here for 2 and a half months and dont cooperate with anything. He dont have food stamps (only me) and food is there for a week or so. He dont want to drive me to the Clinic Lab. I need a lot of blood work (I also was supposed to have a CBC because I have Dengue Fever) and he denied. I dont have any money to move on my own. He has a car full of gas. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY HE IS SO MAD ON ME. He insulted me and everyday i feel worse and worse.  Contemplating suicide again in a more aggresive way. I feel that I'm going crazy (Crazy crazy...) Im tired of living like this. I want to move away to USA and start a new luife with no one judging me.  THANKS FOR READ ALL THIS AND IM SORRY!  P.S. Sorry for the long of the writing   
Hi  I wonder if anyone who has been on aripiprazole or abily could let me know how they find being on it and if it affects working on it. My doctor is thinking of putting me on it for my bi polar, am on litium and citalopram as well. I was on dispersion before and felt flat and numb on that.  Many thanks 
My boyfriend has supported me the past year and he's really struggling. I'm struggling with how bipolar has cost me a year of my life in hospital, my job which I worked my ass off at university to get a first class degree for, and now I'm worried it may cost me my boyfriend.  There's lots of information about how partners support bipolar but what things can I do to help my boyfriend cope? I really want this to work and I know it has to be a joint effort.  
I was diagnosed bipolar a few years back, for some reason, I don't believe I am, however, when I look at the symptoms I can see I am. (Sounds nuts I know). I also have PTSD.  My question is probably in light of the above, hoping that someone can identify with my current symptoms and maybe help?  Yesterday and today I have constant nausea, I get this often. My BF puts it down to 'anxiety'. I feel SO lethargic, I keep dosing off. (I am not sick per se as in an illness as I'vve had this before.). I feel tearful, so negative about everything, I hate myself, I want to go for a walk to feel better but I can't. I cry at the drop of a hat. The nausea is like a deep seated sickness or feeling of disgust. I can't explain it.  I really hate where I live right now, but I can't change it and this is making me worse.My legs feels stretchy and sore. I look in the mirror and hate myself to such a degree I can't stand it. I look like a 'monster'. To me anyway. Please, any help or identification would be so appreciated. 
Does anyone know how to cope with haunting memories I keep getting them this week and things keep flooding back think it cause I've seen people I've not seen in years this week. These memories arnt of anything bad they were just stupid choices when I was younger. How can I get rid of these memories or stop myself from constantly replaying them. There causing my mood to drop and me to get sucide thoughts! Any advice welcome? 
About 2 years ago I had a bad flare up of my bipolar symptoms (hypomanic) which then led to a crash last year which I'm struggling to get out of. Where I lived was a lovely place,  out kids all played together and we all had barbies and get together a regularly. School was a minutes walk away. Anyway, the next door neighbour to me decided to start a small fire on the inside of their house, and this did not help my mental state at all especially with the police and fire services everywhere. My husband was angry having lost a step mother and brother in a house fire and my paranoia went through the roof. I ended up having a go at members of the family who are relatives of the next door neighbours but don't live there, who are bad news to say the least and was apparently threatened by one although I can't remember as I'd been drinking (stupid I know). With all this and my head going ten to the dozen I made the decision to move and now I regret it terribly. I had lived there for 7 years with no problems until that happened. Now we are at my parents as I was so depressed I could barely function and although a little better I am still struggling. I feel like Ive isolated us by running away and now my daughter is saying she wants to go back there. The guilt is unbearable and all I do is cry wishing things could be like they were before all that happened. My nurse and doctor said not to make big desicions when I'm ill, but I've done it now and can't bare the thought of it never being the same again. I find it very hard to settle as it is. And it's the only time in my life I did feel that way.  I hate being like this and don't know what to do. People accepted me and my eccentricities there. Now I've cut myself off again and made everything difficult. We've no job or money to rent. It's so depressing. This illness has robbed me. Apologies in advance for the self pity. 
So I'm on lamotragine and it has been a miracle drug in terms of my mood. However, since it got upped to 75mg I have been breaking out in BAD acne. They are red inflamed under the skin spots, first on my jaw and now on my neck. I have always had low self esteem (apart from when I was manic) and although it feels amazing to not feel depressed, the acne is really getting to me. I'm supposed to be going back to work at the end of this month after not working for a year due to severe manic and depressed episodes and hospitalisation. I feel like I lack confidence about going to work though and I want to hide away from the world. I'm trying to fight these feelings but it's really hard for me, especially since the acne keeps getting worse and worse.  My GP said she's never heard of acne from lamotragine. A lot of people on the Internet and myself disagree though. She prescriptive me a topical antibiotic and I keep thinking... Won't the acne just come back worse eventually because of it becoming immune to the antibiotic? Will it even work because it's not typical acne? Will this whole taking medication to treat the side effects of medication ever end? Why are they trying to poison me this way? They conspire against me by giving me medication that will need more medication and just feed into their ways. I know they don't care about my wellbeing and they just want to drug me up to my eyeballs and give me pharmaceutical products that will ruin my life.   I am annoyed because I have an amazing potential new job coming up and I do not want to be unstable like I really want this job. But what if they're lying to me saying I have bipolar just so they can give me medication and poison my body and mind?  Anyway I don't want to tell my dr that I'm weaning off lamotragine so does anyone know how I should do this? I'm going to pretend I'm still taking it because I don't want their conflict and manipulation. And I can't be bothered having my family nag at me. I cba with weight gain medications as an alternative to lamotragine. There is no alternative they are ruining my life.  
I just want to know the pros, cons and some information that people think about these medication.  I was diagnosed 6years ago with mood disorder, but when i was discharged, my GP looked after me and kept putting me on antidepressants, and now returned to a mental health expert in bipolar and mood disorder and gave me the names of these two medications too have a look at and was wondering what people who have taken these (or know someone close) see any benefits? seen any disadvantages? and just a general over view of the medication and which one worked for them better. 
 I was diagnosed with Bi Polar Affected Disorder in 2008. Can you tell me what bipolar 1 & 2 mean as I have never heard these terms before?   than ks 
Hi, I'm not sure how to start this or even what to say but I don't know what to do anymore....I'll try to keep it short....... I have been in a relationship for 3 1/2 years and in November 2014 my boyfriend was diagnosed with bipolar. The diagnosis was a bit of a relief because it gave an explanation to many things however I'm not sure how to continue forward.  We have many ups and downs as I'm sure most couples do and in the recent months I felt as if we were moving forward rather than being in constant arguments. The past 3 days have been horrendous and I believe it's me that is the problem as I cannot help but take things personally, I cannot walk away from someone who blames me for every single thing that goes wrong in his life, or the other end of the scale I cannot go 2 days living with someone who literally ignoreds me, to the point where I wonder if I'm going insane. I can't even be upset myself (I suffer with Rheumatiod arthritis too so I do have down days) because he turns the situation around to be about him and I end up feeling guilty because he feels down.  I feel I have nothing more to give because every single discussion turns into an argument about how I ruin his life, how I use him and abuse him.  I admit that I argue and I am definitely far from being a saint but I am positive that I do not rule his life therefore I don't know how EVERYTHING is my fault? Can anyone help or is anyone in the same kind of situation as me?   
over the last week, which has been quite busy by my standards I have found it increasingly difficult to sleep.  Flight of ideas, musical ear worms and all that jazz.  My husband made me aware that I was going high and begged me to get some help.  So, ignoring him I went off to do my volunteer work, but a good friend suggested I ring the surgery asap. Result - have been prescribed some sleepers.  Will see consultant later this month.  I feel glad that I could be seen so quickly and sad that I was too unwell to do the full day volunteering.  I should know by now that for me lack of sleep is a warning sign that mania is round the corner.  Yet when I went on Lithium 2 years ago I thought it would be a 'magic' panacea to bring a halt to these mood swings.  I wake up feeling pretty lousy and over the last week I end the day on a definite high and unable to sleep.  I would welcome insights from those of you who are on Lithium.  I tried CBT tecniques on my racing mind last night and to no avail.  A frenzied search of my meds drawer garnered 2 Lorazepam which definitely helped me get 2 hrs sleep.  I thought Lithium would totally free me from these attacks.  Any ideas? 
Hi. Today I was diagnosed as Bipolar 2 after a referral from my GP to a mental health team. I have suffered from depression since the age of 9 with major episodes occurring in my late 30's to mid 40's. I am 47 at the moment. i have been on 225mg of Venlafaxine for about 5 years and for a while I felt great, however I. The last 6 months my mood has gone down considerably, with a few "highs". I.e. Compulsive behaviour, addictions, mood swings, racing thoughts etc. all the things that are apparently traits of bipolar. i initially returned to my GP because I was sick of feeling either really low or really high, and want to be "normal". but this diagnosis has scared me. I know this is probably a common reaction to this diagnosis but I still feel scared. i have been prescribed Quetiapine, starting off initially at 25mg per day (to help with my insomnia) which will slowly increase to 200mg per day. at the same time my Venlafaxine will be reduced so that I eventually end up taking only Quietiapine. has anyone else been through this or had experience of it. I have been warned about the side effects, the most worrying for me being weight gain (I know that sounds shallow but I have worked hard to get to the weight I am now and any massive increase will depress me further). but I am very interested to hear other people's stories. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. thanks liz 
I have been taking the same medication for about 3-4 years now. All of a sudden I am having flare ups of similar symptoms that I had prior to starting the medication. I feel suddenly overwhlemed with emotions and want to cry for no reason. I have been getting extremely frustrated and irritated over things that shouldnt bother me and my mood swings have increased. I am afriad to change the medication I am on because I cannot afford to be disabled. Has anyone else had this problem? what should i do? 
Is it true that your bipolar if you medically switch to mania/hypo mania having taken antidepressants only? 
My husband has been treated for depression for the last 6-7 years. Although he remembers feeling suicidal from early 20's. He did try to commit suicide last year and we have not had a good marriage so far. I find him difficult, abusive and just hard work. He doesn't work ( crippled by this) , he doesn't help around the house, he was bankrupt, he doesn't sleep well at night, his dad had bipolar disorder and his family strongly feel he has similar. Although he doesn't experience the really intense highs. More of a hypo mania I think. So, 2 different antidepressants and no change. Now they will change him to a different one but he will hit start it for 6 weeks as he needs to reduce dose of current one by 50 mg every 2 weeks. This seems very slow. Does anyone else have experience of this. I'm dreading it. He isn't good on 200 mg I couldn't imagine him stepping down every 2 weeks with another one in his system.  
does anyone attend a bipolar support group? I have info about one nearby but am quite nervous about going 
I was listening to 'Desert Island Discs' on radio 4 this morning and Stephen Fry quoted the above when asked if he would rather not have Bi-Polar.  I found his reply very helpful and wonder how other people on this forum feel about having the condition.  I was diagnosed in 1977 although I knew I was 'different' way before that (am now 58 yrs old). Bi-Polar is integral to being who I am and although I regret suicide attempts and the chaos I have caused both to myself and others when manic, I simply cannot imagine not having this illness.  I have finally been prescribed a drug regimen that helps me have more control and thus the opportunity to engage more with life.  I do still get black moods and sometimes my husband points out that I am flying too high, but at least these states do not dominate my existence as they used to do.  How do the rest of you feel?   
Please tell me about your experience with alternative treatments  
Hi  Am tapering off risperdone and am finding the withdrawal is hard going, insomnia, restless legs and depression to name a few. How long does this last for am down to 1mg. 
Now i have been in a relationship, an abusive one, for one year and some months. Ive diagnosed when i was 19 and in my first year of college. I have been in a relationship for 1 year and a few months, lately he's been violent, like hitting me and leaving me with bruises all over my face. he does kickboxing btw so there was also choking and squeezing a lot like with his legs, making my liver hurt like hell therefore i was puking for 2 days. he says its because i made him that way and there were reasons to hurt me like that. before, it was just my disease that made me feel trapped, but now i feel like in a prison because of him. he abuses me verbally and physically, he calls me names and tells me that i am and mean nothing in this world. did i really deserved this for being depressed for months at a time? and jealous i must admit, but i explained that because of my disease i imagine things and things are real in my head, and i cant always see the reality.he was nice in the first few months... 
Hi..  I'm new here so I'm really wanting some good advice from you guys as I have no idea..  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 6 years ago after years of my mother trying to get me seen..  Anyway  I take my meds and I've recently just started back at the mental health clinic after loosing my nan I completely lost the plot..  I've signed centre been made redundant 6 weeks ago and I'm a nervous wreck. My anxiety is terrible and I really don't feel upto going starting somewhere new etc. It frightens me to death.. Can any of you tell me what if any benefits I'd be entitled too.  I'm 35 live with my partner in rented house, we have two kids 15 and 19 my partner works.  Thankyou.  X   
i have just been prescribed Quetiapine and I'm worried about putting on weight. I'm faidly heavy already and I already take lithium, amisulpiride and duloxetine. The Quetiapine is to eventually replace the duloxetine and amisulpiride.   Any my advice on weight gain and how good this drug is would help. 
I was on the Driving/Vehicle Licensing website for information not related to my medical condition and stumbled across Bi-Polar Disorder having to  be  notifiable for driving purposes.I admit to being a bit taken aback by this as neither my gp or psychiatrist has ever mentioned this.I know that in reality this means gp will be contacted and  my license will probably need reassessing every 3yrs like diabetics do but i don't think i have come across this in any of the bi-polar sites i have accessed either.Anyone out there informed DVLA ????? 
I read a lot of posts & comments regarding individuals afflicted with bipolar saying & doing dreadful things towards others, especially during hypomanic & manic states!  Has anyone found the opposite to be true, not so much during elated periods, but focussing most if not all negative behaviour & comments on yourself rather than others?  I have so little confidence at times & my self esteem is practically none existent. I've been married 11 years & love my husband so much, but I'm constantly finding reason for him to leave me, worry he's having an affair, think I'm too overweight, old, unattractive, mentally unstable, etc, etc... So much so, I fear I'll push him away so I'm in control rather than risk him leave me & break my heart.  I worry I'll never be well enough to truly enjoy my life again & spend so much time thinking about suicide & taking all the emotional pain away. I tried this 15 years ago, it wasn't nice & resulted in a long psychiatric hospital stay! I'm not in the same emotional state & haven't been since then & can always find numerous justifications of why not to do it & therefore won't!  My counseller told me it's a natural thing to think about, a way out from the emotional pain felt & not to worry about it as long as plans are not made & reasons for not carrying it through are present.  I'm so blooming down on myself... I turn most things into a problem regarding myself! Its not helpful & I worry I'll become a self fulfilling prophecy! Bizarrely, despite the bipolar diagnosis, I'm actually an optimistic, bubbly person! These characteristics are certainly initiated by low moods...  I rarely direct negativity towards others, just myself.  Anyone else like this? 
Hello,  I am here for myself but mostly for my husband who has been diagnosed with Bipolar Mixed. and really just need help understanding what happens and how others deal and cope with the mood changes.  
Help, from you to me, at this time. I prefer  your country,  hands down- people are caring and see the needs of others, unlike  my country, USA.  Oh well, they say I'm bipolar,  as of two months ago. Kinda makes sense  but, why they  let me in horrible  pain physically  and mentally.  At present  it cost me my 20 year marriage,  my business,  my friends and now, the worst,  my son's respect  and lack of any interest  in my life, says I have no life, and last week, I wish you just kill yourself.  Pretty strong words  for a 13 yr old. But, I see where he's coming  from-  my gut hurts so bad, like  so bloated and pressure.  Can't sleep, and 24/7 headache. . Up and down, mostly  down, in my emotions,  cry at will, so angry at the world and our Great God. He can take this from but, just just allows,  for reasons He only knows. Suicide,  not at time, too much of a coward,  but, pray every night,,, not to see the morning sun. When I hear the birds start to sing, with the beautiful  sun on the rise- I  put my earplugs in and go under  blankets. Sleep or just in bed for sometimes,  18 hours... Please  help me,,, I know you will. Your friend,,, Chris 
Hello... I'm new to the site & just needed to talk... I've been diagnosed for 15 years with Bipolar 2 & have experienced many symptoms.  I'm experiencing low level depression at present, I've lifted from daily crying & total avoidance of daily activities, to feeling flat & not wanting to do much, however carrying out what's absolutely necessary. I've been taking an antidepressant now for just over 3 weeks so will start to lift more & more shortly; only to then start looking out for hypomanic symptoms (it's all a self management game that can be so draining)!  I'm struggling at the moment dreadfully with self confidence & esteem & my thought processes. I feel I am fat, old, unattractive, useless & unworthy & I'm constantly questioning my husbands desire to stay with me?! I'm out of work again due to my moods, I am not carrying out any of the careers I'm trained & qualified in & now even struggle to hold down a less stressful job. My thoughts are turning every situation into a negative; if my husband leaves the house I think he's meeting someone, if he's looking at his phone I think he's interacting with another woman.  Although we've been married over 11 years & together 12 with a son together & he's never given me any reason to doubt him, my negative thoughts are crucifying me! I'm almost 13 years older than my partner which generates insecurity...  I know these thoughts are typical symptoms of the depressive pole & I'm sure once I've lifted or when next euphoric, I'll be back to feeling invincible & the sexiest woman alive; well, I'll feel better about myself anyway!  The constant cycle & inability to stabilise moods & mind sets, just make me despair! Anyway...I've waffled enough, just needed to offload & would love to interact with someone, although appreciate that there may be no-one around.  Thank you for reading, take care, as I will too. ;0)  
Hi,    When i was 13 i was diagnosed with bipolar. Right around the time of my 15 birthday i was diagnosed with manic bipolar. I feel like over the years i have gotten better. I was so awful when i was younger. Couldnt even make it through a whole day of school sometimes. Anyways i do have some set backs, and it doesnt take much to get me going. My boyfriend wants me to really work on my anger, hes asked alot and has been for awhile. And i wanna be able too myself. For us, and our son. Any tips or suggestions would be awesome. Thank youâ¡  
I have suffered with depression and anxiety for two years know been to see mental health nurse she said that she is unable to help and need to see mental health doctor as I have bipolar going to see him tomorrow. Feel i can't go on any more  
hi been diagnnosed bipolar 2 as i have had 7-10 days hypomanic and 17 days of severe depression i write a daily diary looking at this since day 17 i get up and down days of fluctuating mood is this normal with bipolar? x 
Hiya, this is my first post so please excuse me if it's not in the correct area! I have been seeing a psychiatrist for about 6 months now and don't seem to be getting very far.   She has diagnosed GAD, for which I take Pregabalin and do yoga. This has gotten a lot better generally speaking, however I believe I may have bipolar 2, which seems to be going ignored.   I have had 3 major depressive episodes, one at 17 years old, 20 and now at 24. They lasted 6 months, 4 months and now about 1 year. I do not really get highs, but sometimes just go a little hyper. I have experienced some mild desctructive behaivours such as maxing out my credit card and speeding while driving (I haven't felt in control, but almost like i'm being sped up and that i'm in a race and can't slow down). I'm experiencing a particularly bad bout of depression, have been feeling suicidal and just had some instances when i've been hysterically crying and unable to stop. Aside from this i've had usual depression symptoms.   My dr did mention it could be bipolar 2 but doesn't want to diagnose anything, due to the fact i've had a pretty horrific childhood, am still quite young and neither of my parents have been diagnosed with any mental health issues. My father gets depression and sleeps all day (as do I) and my mother was sectioned twice in her early 20's when she lived overseas however both have histories of substance abuse.  I saw another psychiatrist as part of a trial I agreed to take part in for my GAD and she said that she thought I had PTSD as well as Bipolar 2 in addition to the GAD but my pyschiatrist dismissed this at the time.   My Dr was thinking of putting me on a mood stabiliser or AD  when I started feeling suicidal and I have been put on Mirtazapine which is just made me have horrific rages over the smallest things. I feel like I want to punch someone I am so angry. I have also put on a lot of weight in a short space of time and want to eat constntly- my appetite is insatiable!  I am seeing my dr today and just feel like i'm not being taken seriously.I think I may have had some mild hallucinations a few days ago- almost like daydream, I drifted off and then can't really remember what happened but it felt like a vivid dream. I am just in despair. I don't know if I have Bipolar 2 or not, but feel like this is what my symptoms lean towards....What do I do?!  I'm sorry if this is a bit of a mess but I feel like this is not particularly clear-cut! Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks! 
I havent been on abilify very long, but I feel like its making me edgy and kind of manic.   I am forced to stay on it right now, because I have to wait two weeks to get my old medical records.   This will determine if I was on abilify in the past and I was taken off of it, because I wasnt reacting well to it        To make a long story short, I am being seen in an outpatient program; so it isnt the doctor who had normally been treating me.   I had trouble reaching him and ended up going to the er.  Thats how I ended up in an outpatient group therapy program and got the med changes there     I had been on seroquel for many years but it seemed to not be working     I personally think that if they gave me back my mood stabilizer I would have been better    But they completely took me off seroquel and put me on the abilify     Why do people do this ?   Maybe its my fault in a sense, I could have said "Instead of taking me off seroquel why dont we try adding back my tegretol with the seroquel"    Unfortunately, I failed to mention this    UGHHHH  
I've had depression for over 2 years now, including a period where it was very severe. I am currently on 20mg Fluoxetine which seems to be helping with both depression and crippling anxiety.  In recent weeks/months I've often found myself filled with energy and excitement for no real reason. I'll find it hard to concentrate or even sit still and I'll need to channel the energy out somehow or I'll become frustrated. I can go on walks that last a number of hours and not feel the need to stop. However, I'll then have a day where I'll be exhausted and struggle to leave my room or I'll be both tired and elevated. I'll also have a number of days or weeks where I'll return to my depression before the energy kicks back in.  I know there are number of things that could be causing this such as my antidepressants or possibly an overactive thyroid but I have noticed the following as well:  I often have racing thoughts or I'll feel noticeably more important than I really am (but not to the point where I'll have delusions). This is very unusual for me since I have long term self-esteem problems. I also sometimes sleep less and I've done more shopping than usual. These aren't alarming since I'm not putting myself in any serious debt and when I lose sleep it'll only be 1-3 hours, however I am not the type to do much shopping and I usually rely on plenty of sleep to function. Sometimes I have impulsive urges but I never act on them. 
Hello Everyone!  Firstly, thanks for accepting me on here! Not really sure were to start but I will have a go.  I have a long history with Anxiety/Depression and had been put on anti-depressants and Diazepam approx. 13 years ago. Around this time I attended my GP who told me he would like to do a referral to Mental Health Assessment Team as he thought I may have Bipolar.  I was quite taken back by this and decided to change my Doctor as I did not want to be labelled with being Bipolar. My father has Schizophrenia and a younger brother has Bipolar also.  I was brought up in the care system since I was around 1 year old and spent the next 17 years in care homes/foster carers.  As a bit of background: I also spent sometime in a children's Psychiatric Unit (not quite sure why to be honest - although my current Psych Nurse has requested the archived notes).  I have experienced anxiety/Depression since the age of 15 years old. Over the years I became dependent upon the Diazepam and had become addicted to them.  I have been in Psych Hospital previously for multiple over doses as I would have drank alcohol to try and supress the feelings (mostly in a depressed state) resulting in taking over doses.  Mid March this year I was on a 'High' for almost 8 weeks (very little of which I remember) and lost approx. 4 stone in weight in this period. I really cannot account for much of this time and this is very frustrating.I was taken to hospital by Ambulance as a fireplace and mirror fell on top of me ( I don't know what I had done but apparently my neighbour heard this and called Ambulance). I stayed in hospital for 2 days (mainly due to the amount of alcohol in my system and the consultants concern about my mental health).  I then spent 2 and half weeks in a Psych Hospital. In this time I had detoxed from the Diazepam and alcohol (only on diazepam prescribed by the Doc x3 5mg tabs daily).  On discharge the Consultant Psychiatrist had discussed with me that he thought I had PTSD, Underlying Personality Traits (vulnerability - what ever this is?) and wanted me to attend day hospital 3 days a week for assessment for Bipolar.  I have been attending the day hospital for approx. 5 weeks now and in this time my Psych Nurse has mentioned that he has noticed that I had been very depressed for a couple of weeks and they became concerned about a change in my behaviour (I went on a 'high' for about a week) then crashed down to depression - sometimes there is no middle ground were I feel 'normal'.  He has also said that he has noticed quite a drop in my weight again and has asked the Psych Doc to see me ASAP.  Sorry if this is dragging on....I'm trying to out things into context and struggling with my concentration also  :?  Can anyone relate to this?......  Sometimes I can feel a 'High' coming on and sometimes I can't (confusing). When I am high I do some very embarrassing things such as buying 12 pairs of trainers instead of 1 pair! Randomly and without thought sleeping with people I would meet online (something I would never do at all), spent an excessive amount of money recently on a business project that I had previously (whilst feeling level headed) agreed was not salvageable, Stay awake for a week or so without feeling the need for sleep, always taking on more than I can manage (and what I do take on I rarely finish), sometimes I feel irritated for no reason and frustrated that others cannot keep up with me.  There is quite a bit more I could add about my 'Highs' but the list appears endless!  Sometimes these 'Highs' are enjoyable, I feel I can get a lot more done and I welcome these sometimes when I have come out of a period of feeling depressed as when my mood is low I often feel life is not worth living, I am frustrated and embarrassed by my actions at times, the debt I have incurred through stupidity, not wanting to get out of bed, panic attacks at the thought I would have to venture out, even to the local shop for milk! It is really a dark, dark place to be as I am sure most here can relate to.  Recently I attended the local Emergency Department as I could feel the onset of depression after a 'High' and was getting urges to self harm. This is the first time I have actually sought help before things got to out of hand - I followed the advice given to be by my Psych Nurse....I was experiencing constant thoughts of death and obsessing over it, I was hearing voices and noises at home (I live on my own so quite scary), I could not really make sense of the voices I was hearing and could maybe only make sense of a few words - sounded more like rambling, I also felt cutting sensations on both by arms and was getting these extreme urges to cut my arms (something I have never done).  After attending the Emergency Department, the Crisis Psych Team wanted to admit me to the Psych Ward for my own safety. However I really did not want to go back to that environment and agreed to the Psych team calling at my home the next couple of days until I was due back in to the Day hospital a few days later to continue my assessment.  I get confused and frustrated at myself as these episodes are becoming more frequent (with shorter periods of normal moods in between - sometimes I just go from one extreme to another.  I get frustrated that at times I am able to see when I am getting 'High' or 'Low' and also the fact that when I am 'High' I do not always remember what I have done....just does not make sense?! How can I forget things like this??  So, currently my Psych Nurse has no plans to discharge me from Day Hospital, I do feel like I am in Limbo as I do not know what is going on and my Psych Nurse thinks I might have Bipolar....He has asked the Psych Doc to see me sooner rather than later as he feels I might need some medication for my moods (becoming erratic lately - ups and downs- sometimes change every week or so with no normal mood in between).  Sorry to be rambling on and sorry if I have not put things across clearly!!  By Psych Nurse has the best of intentions but is constantly forgetting to request PSYCH Doc to see me (day hospital is quite under staffed at present). This makes me feel as if no one really cares and sets me off feeling depressed.  I know you guys/girls are not here to do the PSYCH Doc's job, but just wondered if anyone can relate to any of this....like I say I feel as I am in limbo not knowing what is going on....  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks,  Keith 
Hi anyone, how sad to see no entries so far this year. Does that mean no-one needs any help?  In my husband's case it would simply mean he can't summon up the energy to post an entry.  It's so sad, he was diagnosed back in the eighties with bi-polar.  I've been with him since 1994 and we've just had our third bout of mania, lasting five months, and now he's back in hosp with severe depression.  For the first time he's trying ECT.  I wonder if anyone else has experience of this?  The first session lifted him a bit, but since then he's thinking it actually makes him feel worse.  The aim is to carry on for up to six weeks.  I know it can have the side-effect of damaging his memory, but his memory is already hopeless, caused I think by so much depression in his life.  Age doesn't help either, he's now 64. He has me and a teenage son, but this bout of mania was pretty foul. Involved lots of spending of money, alcohol, the police, being banned from local pubs and hotels etc etc.   For the first time too he was making advances on other women and being verbally foul to me.  He was sectioned twice.    I do ignore lots of it as am able to differentiate between the 'normal' nice husband and the other.  There is, however, always a touch of truth with what he comes out with.  Very remorseful now the other side of it has kicked in. He was on lithium for years; each time he's gone manic it's because he's taken himself off it.  Has just tried Sodium Valproate but that didn't seem to be doing anything. Anyway, if anyone's got any experience of ECT I'd be pleased to hear. Thanks and hang in there x . 
My daughter is suffering with  Hypomania Is she ablidged to tell the DVLA even though she is not on medication? 
I was on medication for several years and still struggled with the symptoms. Between that and the side effects I endured, I decided it wasn't worth it to me to take medication anymore and I gradually decreased my dosage and eventually stopped taking the medication all together. I have been off meds for about 8 months now. Paranoia has been a big obstacle for me and continues to be, along with a plethora of other things, but I have to keep telling myself that it's all in my head. Knowing that I'm not alone in my "illness" gives me some strength and encouragement, though every day can be quite a struggle. Anyone else struggle with paranoia?  
Hi on Lithium at the moment and thinking of trying depakote due to side effects. Any info appreciated 
Son is 24 also has Severe Autism and is non verbal and Epileptic.Today son had an absence in a cafe then around 45 mins later lost the plot in a busy high street directing his aggression at my hubby.Son went red in face and shook uncontrollably with rage shrieking and hissing throughout and trying to lash out.I had to give 5mg of Diazapam to calm him down.His uncopoerativeness worsened and his rage and intensity of violent movement increased.Took me making my hubby disappear and me talking him down to calm the situation.I am new to this and his behaviour was so frightening it terrified his two younger siblings.Also he has started to snore heavily since given Lamotrigrine for his Epilepsy!Any help and advice really needed and appreciated please 
Hi. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder about 4 months ago after 20 years of misdiagnosed unipolar depression. I am seeing a pyschiatist and am on anti depressants and mood stablisers. I've been feeling really well for the past 3 to 4 weeks and quite 'stable' however the past 10 days or so I've been unable to sleep. This has escalated into not really wanting to sleep or feeling the need to sleep and I'm up at all hours just doing 'stuff'. Is this the start of a hypomanic period? Am i on the verge of a crash? I don't really understand the condition.... Please help. 
Well, first thing is I dont have a diagnosis of bipolar. Its been mentioned a few times by therapists,but more in a dismissive kind of way. My family seem to think it is,but I know that goes for nothing.  I've suffered from anxiety and depression since I was 16, 20 years ago now. Some really bad crippling times, always felt the need to over achieve,intense over working and creativity at times, a lot of things that for me,and I guess the professionals dont really mean very much.  One thing that sticks for me that I cant reason with is,I dont think I know how to feel happy. Which I know sounds very mild and throw away but over the years I've done all the things they tell you to do, music, art etc. But all that happens is I do them to the point of exhaustion and obsession. I end up burnt out, they dont make me happy and when people tell me to do things that make me happy,I honestly could slap them! I honestly dont think I know how it feels, and that makes me so mad. I've also recently started really getting aggrivated if people dont agree with my point if view,it seems so obvious that I'm right and everyone else is wrong. Its exhausting and life is just to hard, I dont know what to do,or whether I should suggest bipolar to my therapist? I dont rate my therapist very much,but I think again that's part of my problem,constantly unimpressed and annoyed by everyone! 
Has anyone come across a consultant willing to explore reduction of lithium in conjunction with lifestyle and dietary changes?  My DFiL is flat as a pancake. 
I hope you don't mind but I wondered if you could tell me a little more about the symptoms of bipolar?  I have been suffering with depression for about two years now. I had a few bad patches as a teenager aswel. I never saught help until recently when I developed severe anxiety and I am now at the beginning of the process of getting diagnosed properly. I have been prescribed Prozac and am awaiting a referral to a mental health expert.   My brother-in-law (who is a behavioural counsellor) is the one who told me to see my GP and discuss the possibility of seeing a psychiatrist. What he did not tell me but I overheard him saying is that he is 'almost positive' I have bipolar disorder.  After looking into it online, I think he may be right. I am aware of the dangers of self-diagnosing and don't want to convince myself of anything. However, I also know how tricky it can be to get a right diagnosis and thanks to funding cuts for mental health where I live I think it will be a long time before I get the professional help I need. I would really like to know what I'm facing.  My life has been up and down like a yo-yo since I left school (I'm 26 now) - I'm reasonably intelligent, have had some amazing jobs and should be successful and happy by now, but everytime things start going right I collapse again. it would be nice to know why. Please help.  Thank you xx  
I think my ex partner and kids dad has bipolar we are still close n get along. His moods can last between days to months. They have lasted up till about 6 months but since we split up he can go from really high to low in a day n last less than a week he seems to be yo yoin. Some of the things he did was on high he would be the life and sole of everywhere. Wanted to do everything at once decorate the whole house build a play house everything in a day. Would go to the shop and end up spending his entire wages on flowers n gifts or rubish so much so I used to have to take his bank card. He used to bounce around whilst talking and not wait for replies before changing the subject . Quit jobs n not care n run up thousands of pounds of debt n not care.not sleep n run around like superman. When he was low he used to disparate over debt shut himself away not talk to anyone even me. I could not touch him or even  go near him. He would just sleep all day and night n go into rage for no reason usually with objects. And is suicidal he has even tried before a few times. there are times when he's neither n just inbetween. When I try to talk to him he says it everyone else. Everything his does matches bipolar except how often and how much his moods change. What could this be bipolar what else could it be I want. To help him with it but not sure if it definitely is can anyone please help  
Hi all, Not sure if anyone can help, offer any advice.  I have been on Pregabalin and Sertraline for a combined issue of rapid cycling bi polar and Acute anxiety disorder.  Whils tthe meds keep things under control 60 per cent of the time, ( another story ) it is starting to get in the way of my sex life.   Without being crass, Im sure alot of men would love to be able to have sex for hours and not copulate, and when it first started I was of the same opinion , however, when you meet someone you really like and want to share intimate times with Im finding this is becoming a problem.   It would be good to chat to people who have experienced the same.  Thanks

I've been tapered off all medication by my psych. Won't bother going into the details of all the meds or withdrawals apart from the quetiapine withdrawal itching. I've had it when I've stopped Q before both times it's day one as soon as I stop my final dose. If anyone else has experienced this have you been able to ease the itching before it stops naturally and if so how? 
I have major mood swings and get extremely suicidal and majorly happy and it can happen in the blink of an eye. I get extremely irritated with my partner and family over really petty things but at the time to me they seem like the worse thing possible. I can just wake up and feel like crying or really angry at my partner for no real reason.  I have had a very bad childhood and a abusive relationship.  I've been on antidepressants since I was 15 but they don't seem to touch my moods. It's ridiculous and I don't know what's wrong with me. I've had tones of counselling and CBT and my moods are still extremely erratic. Anyone any ideas/suggestions. My mum thinks bipolar. I'm now 22. I feel embarrassed going to the doctor and saying I think I have bipolar when I don't have a clue. 
I just can't! Mood swings are on daily bases... Few days ago I was about to commit suicide and today I'm the happiest and careless person in the world... WHY CAN'T I GO TO BLOODY STORE AND GET PSILOCYN MUSHROOMS. WHEN I DO SHROOMS ONCE A MONTH I'M NORMAL:I SLEEP, I EAT, I DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL, I DON'T DO DRUGS.  These days I drink at night so can fall asleep, cause I need to work early in the morning. F*** all of this bipolar f****** crap, I'm screaming right now, I can't take this sh*t no more! I workout regulary, I'm in good shape... it's not helping, I'm destroying my life, I do stupid things, I can't control this... I'm a nice guy, never doing harm to anybody and still all are turning back on me...And these racing thoughts... will You f****** stop... I want my head to be empty... I laugh when I see ppl on the street with headphones and mp3 players thinking: my "head mp3" is playing music (you name it) ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S PLAYLIST IS BLOODY RANDOM AND I CAN'T STOP IT. 
Has anyone had experience of this.  I am terrified that the withawals will trigger mania/depression. 
been diagnosed cyclo 3 years now but my mental health has changed got new assesment im having hypomanic days lasting about 6 days followed by crashing into severe depression thoughts of suicide the full works i think my condition has changed to bipolar 2 disorder anyone else experianced this 
hi guys, i havent been diagnosed with bipolar as yet but i wanted to ask some questions about it where i wouldnt get judged for my behaviour, moods etc.. and also im not sure about the signs, is anyone free to perhaps talk with me and help me? i dont have family for support so i rely on forums 
I'm on 200mg Lamictal (100mg morning, 100mg night-time). I AM on some other meds as well but this is my main med. I struggle terribly with slowed thinking, poor memory, feeling dumb as an ox really. It's like I have to think through a wall of resistance. I can't find my words, I can't think of the most appropriate thing to say. I just feel like an idiot a lot of the time. It makes me anxious and ruins my confidence.  Just wondering if anyone feels like Lamictal does this to them or if you think it's the BIPOLAR that's wreaking this havoc on my brain? I only read recently that bipolar disorder does cause brain damage and I'm wondering if what I'm experiencing is fall-out from twenty years of serious mental illness.  Any comments? 
Hello i have joined this forum in the hope I can learn more about my wife's bipolar and how I can help our family. my wife suffers from bipolar we have been together for 7 years and married for 3 years. When I first met my wife she was on lithium. We have been happy together and wanted to start a family, we worked towards my wife coming off lithium so we could have our first child. Over the 7 years things have been good. A few highs and lows but both have been manageable. We got married in 2011 and had our second child in January 2013. In December 2013 my wife had a bad episode of depression. I had to take time off as my wife couldn't face the day, taking our child to nursery ect. She was prescribed fluoxitine which helped her out of the depression. The fluoxitine may have pushed her to the "higher state". We have had a tough 2 years whilst I have studied part time at university. My time has been taken up by study and I have not been able to help as much as I could have. The last few moths I noticed my wife showing signs of becoming "high": excessive drinking, smoking and talking on the phone, On 15th June my wife left us, she went to be with her cousin who suffers from alcohol addiction. She said he needed her ;she's only known this cousin for a couple of months. My wife felt it was her job to help him out. I understood and thought my wife was doing a good thing,  my wife didn't return home for a few days I had to take time off to look after our children, then at 5:30am one morning my wife phoned me and said she didn't love me and wanted a divorce, she said she had not been happy fir moths (news to me). I've never treated her bad. I pay all the bills bad I don't have a lot left over to spend on taking us out to dinner.  I found out my wife wS then sleeping with this cousin. I felt like my life was falling apart. I confronted her and said I was going it divorce her.  After a couple of days I thought this was not fair on my mentally ill wife to divorce her, I apologised and told her I didn't want to. I had read up on bipolar and understand the chemical imbalance in the brain and the descision making process is effected.  I have been off work for 7 weeks looking after our children and I am unfit for work (stress). I have fallen out with my patents over the choice not to take my wife to court.  My wife wouldn't return home despite our 4 year old son sobbing his heart out to her. She continued to stay at her cousins house.  My wife said she would come back when SHE was ready, as she was angry at me and didn't want the kids to see her in this state.she's fallen out with her family and friends following her actions.  My wife can home a week ago and has been taking medication (olanzphine)? But she still feels the need to "escape" to her cousins as his wife suffered from bipolar and "he understands her". This hurts me as she tells me they as best friends now, I have tried saying to her I love you and I don't want you to go but she thinks I'm controlling her bad this makes her not want to get back with me. My kid spine after her every night which reduces me to tears (not in front of them). I hVe put the children in to child care for 3 days a week but recently found out I am entitled to £0 child tax credits. So now have a big nursery bill.  I'm falling apart emotionally and financially as I gave my wife £350 (after increasing my overdraft) which lasted her a week as she went out and got hammered.  I don't know how to carry on, it's killing me. I'm doing a good job of looking after the kids - her parents say they are better off with me!  My wife says if we are to get back she needs her space to help her recover, she spends the day at our house then drives to her cousins and stays there, she comes home when the kids wake up. any advice would be greatly appreciated. rob 
Hi Having been diagnosed recently i am feeling some relief that at last i no what has been wrong with me for many years!! It is all about getting the meds right now and i was first put on Quetiapine which apart from major sweats at night really did help however after an ecg my doctor decided she wouldnt increase my dose. Was devastated as i saw light at the end of the tunnel for first time in years!!  I am now on Aripiprazol and tommorow night i add in Trazodone. I would love to hear from other people who may be in the same boat or have just had some experiences with these tablets . Many thanks for reading and any advice greatly appreciated. 
I was a heavy drinker for over ten years. 5 yrs ago my mum said I have the symtoms of bipolar but was reluctant to seak help as alcahole took priority. I finally quit in 2013 and took antidepressants as it was do or die. It was after quitting that the bipolar symptoms showed their true effect.  After receiving help from a specialist in bipolar he prescribed me carbamazapine and duloxetine however still claims I don't have bipolar!  Thinking back, obviously the depressive side of the illness was paramount but also the hypo mania was press ant also, which was masked by the alcahol.   Unfortunately I only saw my PD 3 times and didn't feel this was long enough to discuss the history of my symptoms.   If I'm not bipolar, why these meds?   Anyone else been in the same situation?  Thanks 
Please can someone help. I have been getting treated for depression for just over a year. I was on flouxetine but didn't do anything so I am on seraltine I think it's called but I don't know if it's working. Some days I can be on cloud 9, everything is going right and I am happiest girl alive. Someone can say something to me that I don't like and I completely lose it. Take for instance other day my bf said something so silly and I just argued and argued and even grabbed a knife to put to myself. I've tried the counselling and didn't work. I habe under active thyroid as well and am due to see doctor on 10th. Do I mention this bi polar to him and see if he thinks it. Please someone help 
I'll try to get to the point.  I was diagnosed bipolar and I met a man when I has on my way to a manic state.  It was a terrible time in my life.  I lied to him and cheated because I thought he was cheating on me.  Everything seemed so real and I was a crazed woman believing he was a cheat and a liar.  I have been healthy mentally since then.  This took place between 2011 and 2012.  The truth is, I don't know how much was real and how much wasn't.   I know I loved him before I met him as we talked on email for months and fell in love with him the moment I met him!  As he waived me to him with his hand that first night.  I have made great strides with my bipolar.  Attending therapy, seeing my psychiatrist and taking my meds.  Some days are harder than others but my bipolar is controlled.  I attend college and am raising my two young boys.  My issue is that I can't stop loving this man!  I don't call him or look him up.  I didn't even keep all of his pictures. ..just one.  But I can't stop feeling like he is the only man for me.  I don't allow myself to date or think of another man.  I am sad and lonely but can't seem to move past him to find a love in my life.  I don't even know if he really loved me.  I dont even know what he thinks of me.  I have thought so many things but I don't know what was real and what wasn't but I believe i'm in love and don't know how to move past it.  I often wonder if I'm just obsessing with him because I've never been in love.  Has anyone felt this way but it was the bipolar or am I in love and can I ever stop loving him?  I don't even think we will ever be together.  He walked away when I pushed him away in 2012 and has not looked back.  He still emails from time to time but just to say hi and see how I'm doing.  I'm heart broken but is it normal to feel this way after so many years?  I don't have anyone I can ask so I came here hoping that someone can help answer my question.  I feel pathetic about this and after all this time, should I want him back if he wanted?  I'm confused and heartbroken over this and just want to be strong enough to walk away but I feel my heart won't let me or is it my illness?   Thanks for reading 
Hi.  Ive posted on here before about my partners bipolar but now I find myself sat at the top of the stairs at my best friends house wondering what the heck I do.  My partner has had the diagnosis of bipolar for 7 years now. I myself suffer from clinical depression which is also tough. After two years together we've been through some extreme situations along with some great ones too.  He had found the right medication finally we thought as it seemed to level him out really well & life became far easier & happy all the time again.  Recently he decided he was going to try & quit smoking. Went to the doctors & smoking clinic & away he went. So did the easy, balanced life and once again I was faced with uncontrollable rage which made my stomache turn. I had panick & anxiety attacks, was hysterical & was wretching & throwing up.   A few days later he snapped at me for asking his opinion and without saying a word I apparently didn't like his honesty. And off he went again. Truth is though I appreciated his advice & even followed it. Which he knew. Before I knew it he was angry at me for no reason. He wouldn't listen when I tried to talk & he told me to never ask his advice on anything to do with that subject ever again. Then told me to leave him alone. I went into my bathroom & sat on the floor crying, wretching & hysterical once more. He went out & I had a bath to try & calm me. I decided I needed to get out & clear my head.  Whilst I was out he started txting asking where I was and being off with me. He started trying to argue with me so I asked why it was he felt the need to intrude on my quiet time thus not being respectful,  yet if he asks for it I leave him alone.  I just couldn't face going home knowing he was still angry. I ended up out until 8pm and when I came home he went upstairs.  He had to go out later on & I had to get up early to take the little one to school. So I decided it would be best for me to sleep on the sofa, as if he had she would have woken him in the morning.  He came home and had seemingly softened a little. He spoke to me a bit & I said I think we both need space apart for a while. He agreed but said he had nowhere to go. He went through his family & friends list & there were reasons for him not being able to go. I said I would quite happily have left for a while but I have two children who need the stability etc. He said we are just going to have to cope under one roof then & when I said that it wouldn't work properly he took it like I was kicking him out on the streets.  He went upstairs & must have fallen asleep. I settled on the sofa. A few hours later he came barging in, switched the light on & told me to get to bed. This made me both angry & upset. I told him I was fine and I was asleep & explained my reasons for being on the sofa. He said with my fibro it wasnt an option and just go to bed. If he had been gentle & caring with it I might have listened but barking orders at me is not acceptable.  Then I got accused of throwing his caring back in his face. Then off he went again about being kicked out onto the streets & got louder & louder.  Little did I know at the time he had actually just woken my eldest daughter who is 11, & she heard everything!  He slammed the back door behind him & left me in tears once again. I couldnt face it if he came in & had another go so I went upstairs.  In the morning I got up after having about half an hours sleep and sorted the little one. (She's little to me but she's 7). I also packed some things a bag and off I went. I turned to my best friend and my parents for help. Later that day he txt asking if we had any money for a hotel room as he didnt want to stay in the house. We didnt but said I would go talk to him.  my friend came with me for support which instantly got his back up. He refused to talk with her about and so we had to go upstairs. (At this point I'd like to say that my best friend has cyclothymia).  Once upstairs he refused to listen & proceeded to pull stuff out of his wardrobe like a madman saying 'I'll f###king leave then shall I?'  I asked why he was being this way and where on earth he was going to go. I was met with a barage of abuse about how I didnt care & I might aswell have told him to just get out. I kept calm & left him to it. I returned to my friend who was sat in the kitchen with a brew waiting.  He stormed in & out huffing & puffing & banging things. He eventually came in & said he'd be borrowing a tent off his brother & would be out of my hair. He walked out the door to the garage where we assumed he was getting his bike.  I had to go to pick little one up & when we returned he was still in the garage. I txt and asked him if he was still there as I needed food for the kids but didnt want another confrontation.  He said the tent thing fell through & that he woukd be staying in the garage but would leave for 5 mins to allow me to the freezer.  I couldnt settle knowing he was there & he'd be in & out to use the toilet & get food etc. Regardless of the fact he said he wouldnt & he'd manage in the garage.  I had to arrange for my childrens dad to come pick them up a day early & for myself to stay with my friend. I txt & told him so he could come back into the house.  Since then ive been faced with angry msgs & calls saying how he's been dumped alone whilst I get all the support I need. He's also posted a long meaningful reply to a post in a support group re our situation & how his fiance is at her wits end. That he's losing everyone he loves due to the nastiness of the condition and the worst part is that he doesnt even know it's happening until its too late.  His best friend went to see him yesterday after I told him whats happened & he said this quitting smoking is really f*cking him up and making him see negativity where there is none.  Since ive been with my friend she's told me something she's been sat on for ages. Last year I had an attempted suicide due to my condition etc. Whilst I was in hospital my partner told her that he didnt sign up for this and as soon as I was better he was leaving.  This has absolutely destroyed me. I'm left feeling that he doesnt really care & after everything I've put up with from him why couldn't he stand by me the one time I needed him the most. Utterly heartbroken & can't see a way forward.  My children are back on tuesday so I also feel under pressure to have all this sorted one way or another.  :'(  
I was diagnosed with bipolar last year after a manic episode. Been depressed for nearly 2 weeks, struggle to get out of bed. I take my daughter to school then straight back to bed where I stay all day. Trying to fight it before it gets worse. Does anyone with bipolar see visions like a dream but your awake of something bad happening to family members and feel strongly that its going to happen and that your the only person to stop it from happening. 
hi, today i was diagnosed with bipolar. its a bit overwhelming but i just wanted to as like minded people some advice about it as i have no family or any support around me. ive been pt onto epilim chrono medication, does anyone else take this type of medication? does anyone have any tips on how to cope with bipolar as im not sure how to deal with it as its all so new to me

Anybody familiar with this medication? This may be an alternative for me instead of Quetipine. Do this drug make you eat? What are the known side effects. Many thanks. 
I have had bipolar I since I was 20, but it wasn't properly diagnosed until 2004, when I became psychotic. I was initially put on olanzapine, which made me as fat as a walrus. I'm now on 25mg of quetiapine four times daily, and 200mg of lamotrigine, 100mg twice  day. Yet I feel so exahusted all the time, I wake up and within the hour I feel utterly fatigued. This has gone on for three years now, since I stopped drinking, I have no one in my life who can help me with this, I am intensely lonely and yet this prevents me from forming relationshis with anyone. I am completely at the end of my tether and don't know what to do or how to progress. I have been on lamotrigine for three months and quetiapine for a year. Nothing seems to help. Any advice or words of solace would be a huge help  
Hi all, I have been suffering from bipolar disorder since April 2014 when I was 17. I had regular appointments at my GP and they diagnosed me with depression and put me on fleuxetine 20mg. These didn't help at all so in September 2014 I was put on mirtazapine 30mg I find these help with depressive episodes but no nothing at all for controlling my mood and mania episodes. My doctor has been promising me a referal to a pshychiatrist since April 2014 but every time I confront him on this or the other GP's at the surgery they tell me that they do not want to put a label on me because of medical insurance and the army etc, even though the army is not an interest of mine. I keep getting told "you will feel better when the sun comes out" I feel like I'm being fobbed off and nothing is being done to help my bipolar other than an anti-depressant. Can anybody help?  Cheers 
I have been taking lithium for approximately 2 years.  I have gained weight from it and I dealt.  However, now I am always feeling bloated and constantly nauseous.  I am concerned I'll develop a thyroid problem.  Has anyone experienced similr side effects and how did you resolve it?  Thanks!  
Hey guys. I got on cit back in July 2014 for the first time ever. Before that I'd been depressed for about 3-4 years and actually being unaware of my depression, just thinking it was apart of my life or "who I was".. Until my suicidal thoughts became unmanagable and I had no other route than take my life. I spoke to my mom and we decided I'd start on took 20mg. It kicked in about 2wks and I could certainly tell a difference.  It was a world of difference. As if I felt alive for the first time in my entire life. I enjoyed things I never did and loved myself for who I was. My interest in things became alive for the first since I could remember. I had so much energy. I was happy and I loved it. Except a little unstable...  I had to much energy and learned new things about myself as my depression lifted. Such an exciting time but also dangerious. I was sleeping at night and started to get tremors at about 4 wks into it. then started smoking pot and drinking alchohol because I could "handle it" more adequately and go balls to the walls haha it was fun... BUT an erratic sleep schedule and drugs ended me up in my first hospitalization where I was diagnosed as Bipolar Type 1...  I got off the Cit and sorta ranaway from home got involved into drugs again. which resulted in my 2nd hospilization without any antidepressant in my system. Hence you I've never really had any manaic episodes in my life before starting the cit..  . I've been living at home, no drugs, no alchohol, a good sleep and food schedule. But im really depressed and have been depressed ever since my 2nd hospitlazation and basically getting off Cit  After trying diff meds for the past 4-5 and dealing with my immense brutal depression I've decided to get back on Cit with Depakote. We started and tested at 5mg for 2wks, tried 10mg for 2wks, and now I'm at 20mgs. It's about my second week on 20mgs and this is about the time it last kicked in for me in 2014..  I'm abit nervous if I'm gonna have the intense energy and "mania" side of my bipolar and if maybe the depakote interferes with Cit, medical literature say they don't but... Has anyone tried the combination of Depakote and Cit? Does one conteract the other?  
I may come across as an over protective mum but I just feel I need to get this out there. My 16 year old daughter started college last september and became involved with a lad who was very open about the fact that he had bipolar.They started going out and all was well for a time; he sent some lovely texts and was very affectionate and then without warning dumped her saying it wasn't working. That wasn't the end though as the very next morning he bombarded her with texts about how he wanted her but couldn't have her and this continued all weekend. The short story is they got back together, she suggested as a friend if that made it easier but he was adamant that he could handle it.All was well for a short time and then she noticed his erratic mood swings and how he would often be quite hurtful in what he said to her. She's read up on bp and he was flattered- his words-that she cared enough to do this and was pleased about it.It was all very intense, as bp relationships seem to be , and at around two months he told her he was falling in love with her.This was a bit scary- she is only 16 in her first relationship remember- and couldn't say it back. This set off a bit of a storm and he dumped her again.The same thing happened, a barrage of texts about how much he wanted her etc. seeming to forget he was the one who had finished things.There was a bit of a break until he asked her to give him another chance, he was truly sorry, knew he had treated her really appallingly-his words again-but he was scared of his feelings as he had never felt this way and so quickly before[he's 18 now].By this time my daughter had fallen for him quite badly and like so many others didn't want to be another person to walk out on him. She wasn't trying to change or save him but genuinely cared enough about him to want to support him.He then asked her out again and she agreed to give it one more go.I had concerns but felt my daughter was mature enough to make her own deciion on this and I would be there to support her.  This turned out to be a huge mistake. He constantly blew hot and cold, sometimes being loving sometimes totally ignoring her and putting her down in front of others, accusing her of flirting with another lad on the course,she wasn't, getting jealous for no reason,criticising her to the point it was actually verbally abusive .Even when we had a bereavement his response to her was "f*** you" rather than offering any comfort.He then finished with her a final time sending her a very obscure text about how people think they know but dont and thats why it'll never work.He then continued to behave as though they were together, trying to hold her hand etc. again seeming to forget he'd finished things. She was so confused. Since then she's had the usual texts of how he wants her, he can't stop thinking of her etc.He stopped his anti depressants as he said they were making him worse and as for other medication she doesn't know. The time she broached it with him he got angry and said his bp wasn't that noticeable and he had it under control but she can see he hasn't because his behaviour is so up and down. This was the final warning light really;if he can't see he needs help there's nothing she or anyone else can do and so she's having to let go.This isn't easy not least because of all the horrible things he's said to her.Even despite all this she still cares for him and it would be easier she said if she hated him but she doesn't. Her confidence and self esteem is in tatters and I don't know how to help her pick up from this.Avoiding him is not an option ,they are on the same course and in a small group. What I want to know is ,is this bp or is it bp with an overlap of personality disorder?[not that it helps my daughter if it is]He's accused her of things he's guilty of himself- projected his own faults onto her and others, he lies , exaggerates things to make himself the constant centre of attention, says hurtful things that are really abusive, has no regard for the feelings of others yet expects everyone to be there for him all the time.My daughter just needs something to make sense of it all and to be able to believe that she's not this dreadful person he's told her she is. As a final thing , it now seems he has found someone else which is good as the begging texts have stopped. I can't help feeling sorry for this new girl as I can't imagine things will change with him. My daughter was the longest he went out with someone ,his other relationships didn't last longer than a month and although I'm upset and angry he treated her like this , I know he can't help it and wonder if the lad will ever be able to have a happy relationship. It's sad for all concerned and I feel for anyone involved in a relationship with someone with bp as you really have to put your self aside and focus on that person. My daughter was way too young for this intensity and I'm heartbroken that her first romance has left such a negative impact on her.   
Hi all  I've suffered from anxiety and depression for many years and am in therapy. I just wanted to ask if others feel like I do. I go through extended periods of feeling really detached and anxious, months with no break, things feel really bad. Then suddenly last night I had a bad panic attack. It seemed to come in waves. It would last a few minutes then fade and I'd feel great, then another wave would hit. Once it passed, I feel great, tired but really a bit euphoric. Does this sound familiar? I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar but it has been mentioned before , just wondered if this sounded familiar?  Thanks 
Hello All  This is my first post on the site. Quite anxious about the internet forum world but really need help from like minded people who are suffering with the same or similiar conditions.   I saw my psycharitrist, and he recognises that i have bipolar and discussed with me the possible interventions and medication avaliable.  I asked him to give me the names of a seletion of medications i can take so I can decide before taking them  He told me that i can either be prescibed Valproate, Lithium or Quetiapine.  From your personal experience (both bad and good) which one has had more of a success in your life  I just want to feel normal and to be able function without the constant battle of my mood swings  Look forward to your reply 
I've tried a few different meds in the hope that I'll find a better coping level with this condition. It's what we all go through but I'd like to know if anyone has ever got to the point where they feel they're at their best for the long term. What's been a good AD and mood stabiliser together for you? I've got a good idea of my next attempt but just wanted to ask about it here. 
Like i have stated i have been suffereing/struggling with depression for 24 years and have since found out that my mum before she killed herself (i was 14 at the time and found her) had bipolar. My big sister has bipolar and It has been said by friends who know me that i too am showing signs of having it, I have done online surveys and they have come back possitive i have been to my gp and they deregard that bipolar even exists. I have anxiety and panic attacks as well and when i can not stop my head from trying to split me into a million peices i also self harm as a release. I have two children and although the thought of leaving them like i was left deters me i am scared a day will come and i really hurt myself please help is there anyway i can get an answer once and for all please.  
Hi there. For a while now I've been a different person. I don't know exactly how long I've been like this but it's only recently I've decided I have a problem. I got with my partner near 4 years ago and I love him so much. But I am horrible to him most of the time for no reason. I will often pick a fight with him when he's done nothing wrong. I won't speak to him for days and this sometimes lasts for weeks with the odd few days where we'll be ok. I find it so so hard to say sorry to him. I'll turn things round and make it his fault. I sometimes forget why I wasn't speaking to him. I'll go mad at him if he makes a mess in the house. I can spend hours cleaning then get depressed when things are messed up again. I sometimes even hate the sound of him breathing! I can't have him even touch me when we're asleep in bed. Sometimes I sleep loads and want to sleep all day. Other times I can't get to sleep at night. In the last 5 years I've got in about £15k worth of debt. I have nothing nice to show for this. I have 2 beautiful children and I never take things out on them but they must feel that I'm not right and notice when I'm not speaking to my partner. I don't even want to go out of the house some days and will stay in and not get dressed. I sometimes even find it hard to have a shower (I'm not a dirty person at all). My kids are well looked after and well fed they are not the issue here. If anyone has any advice it's much appreciated. I don't know what to do next and scared of going to the doctors. Sorry this is not written the best my head is all over the place at the moment.   Thanks in advance  
Hi everyone,  I guess I'm looking for answers no one really has but I'm at a loss as to what to do.or where to turn. My fiance has bipolar and for the last half of last year we seemed to have sort of got it under control with meds. Since christmas though he has gone right back to square 1.  He's has frequent anger outbursts may aimed at me and I don't know how much more I can take.. i'm 5 months pregnant so I'm full of hormones as it is and I have my own mental health issues (although since meeting him 5 years ago these have been brushed under the carpet because it's all about him!?) I have massive abandonment issues and have been hospitalised previously for eating disorders and self harm. (Both of which I have 'recovered' frombut that doesn't mean the thoughts aren't still. There)  as with most bipolar people he can be a lot funny caring guy.. but more often than not at the moment he can be verbally and emotionally hurtful... For example I have been I  tears all morning because when he got up for work today his work shirts weren't in his draw (they were clean and freshly washed downstairs)... For this he called me a lazy f'ing b*tch. ... He knows that breaks my heart.. i do.EVERTHING at home around the house while looking after our toddler and his other 2 children on weekends.  when he says that stuff to me it just tears my heart out. He finds saying sorry incredibly difficult and would rather just pretend it never happened...often i can forget it but it's happening so much at the moment it's starting to really affect me.  This morning had it not been for my little.girl.I. would have cut myself to shreds.. i don't know how else to cope.  I understand it's his bipolar but surely that doesn't excuse the way he speaks to Me?  How do I cope with this? He even slagged me off to his kids in front of me the other weekend.. I don't know where to turn anymore.  � 
Hey Im new on here this is my story someone please help/give advise. Around 8 years ago when i was 15 i went threw alot of heartache due to a family situation. This then sent me into deep depressions i used to have panick attacks suffered with terrible anxiety. Had crazy spending sprees for the most stupid of things. Clothes stuff for the house etc it almost became where i couldnt feel relaxed unless i had spent money . In time this depression turned into anger. I would be very nasty to my partner at the time. Id be very agressive verbally. We split up years later and i then met the partner im with now who is amazing i must say. We recently had a baby who is 6 months old. After having him i was down but just thought it was baby blues. I was very emotional frustrated angry etc. We took a trip to the doctors who diagnosed me with postnatal depression in these last 6 months however things have got worse i can be absolutly fine and somethibg silly will happen like i cant find something and i totally turn into almost another person i start swearing at my partner get angry frustrated and then i go back to my normal self in a split second. Its scary its like i step out of my body i have server mood swings. Make unrealistic arrangments or plans but at the time they seem a great idea i constantly want to be out and busy.. Then there are the days i have no energy just want to sleep all day. Alot of this has been going on along time but it has become worse since  having my little boy. Both me and my partner think this could be bipolar i have seen the doctor and she has told me to fill out a question-air and wean myself of my antidepressants wich are doing nothing for me and im on the highest dose. I feel so alone. Is anyone else experiencing similar things i just want to no whats wrong with me its taking over my life. someone please give me some advice. 
Hey guys, Well basically i have epilepsy and bipolar, neither of which are well controlled. Im on 400mg lamotrigine  Day for both conditions, 250mg keppra for the epilepsy and started on mirtazapine 15mg 4weeks ago for a depressive episode. I'm now going through hypomania! I thought lamotrigine was supposed to basically be a 'miracle drug' for bipolar?? Anyone know whats going on? Not got psychologist, psychiatrist or neurologist for a while. Need help pleeaaassee.... Any advice or info would be really appreciated right now! 
First of all I am totally new to all this and have no idea what I should be saying or doing. My bf has been very honest with me about his bipolar, he also has OCD. I think he has been on a cycle twice before now since we have been together but I am unsure. He doesn't take any meds and as far as I am aware doesn't self medicate with alcochol or recreational drugs. He told me he has learned to control his thoughts etc and that is how he deals with it. This weekend though he has flipped from telling me how much  he loves me and we were having conversations, very light hearted, about moving in together, to sending me a text telling me to F*** Off and go back to one of my ex's that he doesn't trust me and never will. I have given him no reason not to trust me and am not willing to give up on us. In my replies, as he won't actually talk it is only text messages, I have told him I don't believe this is what he really wants and that I won't give up this easy. I just feel like he is trying everything to push me away. About 2 months ago almost exactly the same thing happened and I persevered with it. When he eventually agreed to talk to me a couple of times we worked things out and everything went back to normal. I don't want to push him but when I have suggested it might be a cycle he is adamant its not. I just don't know what else to do. I really do love him and I want to be with him and to help and support him. Any advice would be so much help to me. Thanks  
There are lots of questions I want to understand about bipolar. I have researched it on the web and read the medical findings but I would like âif possible- to get feedback on people who are suffering with this illness.  My daughter is 43yrs old and has been acting giddy/ being excitable/angry/ shouting at people for no apparent reason for a few years.                                                                                                     Everything you say to her is brought into question and she nearly always finds a reason to take things the wrong way -and many times she has said âdo I sound Paranoidâ   Finally after seeing people suffering with mental disorder on the t.v. she recognized that something might be wrong with her! â so we checked out the symptoms on the internet together. After we talked; this prompted my daughter to go and see her doctor who in turn is making her an appointment to see a specialist dealing with bipolar.  Now! What I would like to know is, when she is starting to become excitable (making herself the centre attraction) which is very funny at times but can become embarrassing, or even worse -trying to get someone annoyed to start an argument - do I tell her to calm down and point out that it looks like she is stating another episode _OR_ will this make things worse?  She hasn't been put on any medication by her doctor, presumably because he is waiting for her to see a psychiatrist, so I need to know how to help her in the mean time   Please advise - Thank you     
I have two children and since having my first daughter I went into depression,  at the time I knew something wasn't right but I had also fell pregnant three months later with my second child, which I really struggled with. Thought it was hormonal. I didnt go to the doctors till after my second daughter was born as I was suffering with severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts and was then diagnosed with depression and put on medication.  Unfortunately I didnt keep up with the meds and stupidly stopped taking them within a few months thinking I was 'ok' by the time my second child was 10 months. I started a diet as I felt like my partner at the time (father of my kids) wasnt attracted to me, a month into my obsessive dieting and exercise which resulted in me loosing 5 stone in 4 months. I began thinking about a man I was seeing years before and went on a mission to track him down. I felt like I needed him and I found him. He was a married man now and I started an affair with him. I was so wrapped up in my 'relationship' with him. Suddenly the relationship I had with my partner turned sour. I started to believe he was trying to control me and I started to hate him. I got selfish in every way possible, I just wanted to go out and party all the time. I was obsessed with how I looked. Id push my partner away and I whole heartedly believed at the time he was causing the problems in our relationship what I was doing didnt seem wrong at all. I was cold towards him. All he was doing was trying to make us work. Anyway he found out about my affair and said that he still wanted to be with me. I said I needed space and made him move out. He did and he still tried while I still carried on my affair. Anyone who tried to tell me otherwise or that I was being stupid I thought didnt want me to be happy and was trying to spoil my fun. This all spiralled over about 5 months, in the end I left my partner to be with this married man who was still married and I knew had no intention of being with me but everything at the time seemed perfect and I was unusually happy about it all. It didnt seem to occur to me how much this was going to affect my life and how serious this was. During this time id excessively spend money on things I wouldn't usually care for, went on a festival which cost me 600 in total with stupid things I bought for it, ended up using my rent money and getting myself behind in my rent. Fast forward about a month or so and I crashed.  Tried to top myself while my children were sleeping. Someone I knew had come to check on me that night as they were worried about me ( luckily) I was so depressed, felt worthless, before I felt on top of the world and nothing at all could bring me down.  Suddenly my self esteem completely diminished. Id go over and over everything in my head and constantly have suicidal thoughts thinking my kids would be better off without me. I begged my ex back but rightly so he didn want to know. The happiness I felt with the married man I no longer felt and I didnt want to know him. I was then put on anti depressants again, which after taking them my mood lifted, a bit too much. I felt high again, i was irritable but still battled with my self esteem. I needed to feel attractive again, I started seeing the married again but it wasnt enough and started sleeping with other people, to gain that confidence but in the end left me feeling worthless again. During this particular 'high' I was given my notice on my house due to rent arrears. Im now left questioning everything and thinking what was I thinking during these high episodes it all feels surreal and id like to add all this is completely out of character.  It isnt my usual behaviour. Ive tried to explain this as best I can. I dont think it completely reflects the extent of everything. I've tried to explain it as short as I possibly could. Im scared to go back to the doctors with how ive felt. Theres times where I felt like I was loosing my mind. My whole life has been turned upside down in a year. A few months Before all this me and my then partner was talking about saving for a wedding and getting married, things weren't perfect but I was happy. I just dont get what happened. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you. 
I few years back I was manic/depressive.  Cycling and not taking meds.  I had been in denial, lying, and very ill mentally.  I was suicidal and ended up in the hospital.  I lost people I love.  Some by choice and others who had had enough.  A few years later I am well.  Take my meds, go to group therapy as much as possible and have one on one counseling every three weeks.  I have almost forgiven myself.  I'm just not sure if my decision to stay away from loved ones is the right thing.  There is drama and a lot of things that trigger me.  I also realize who I am and what I want and I know I would not be entirely happy with having to deal with others issues and drama.  As for the people Iblost, I am finally letting go and realizing that I can't force anyone to love me and that I'm done crying and praying for forgiveness and to be taken back.  I've becoming selfish and finally taking care of me.  Praying I making the right decisions and keeping it moving.  Has anyone experienced this?  How were you able to completely let go?  I think I'll get there because I've come a long way but I still have moments of sadness.  
Looking for some advice. My boyfriend has bipolar and has been going between manic and depressive episodes for the last few months. Recently though he seems to have hit a proper low and is depressed all the time. So much so that he has withdrawn from me slightly and doesn't want to be romantic etc. He does tell me that it's all fine and it's just the way he is feeling which I totally get but I really don't like seeing him like this. He does say that he prefers just to be alone and shut off his feelings when he's like this, which again, I totally get but any advice on how I can best help him and best things to say to him would be very much appreciated please? 
I just read an interesting article on the web linking gut bacteria to mental health. Probiotics (good bacteria) or prebiotics (carbohydrates that feed these good bacteria) may have an effect on anxiety or depression. Itâs not written in stone, but it makes a good read. Diet and the mind? You can google the topic.

I have had bipolar type 1 for over fifteen years now and am a woman in her thirties with two children. I have only recently experienced rapid cycling whilst on medication. I am aggressive towards my friends and loved ones, cannot sleep, have diminished appetite and aches and pains all over. I am seriously concerned. I don't want to be hospitalised again. Might I add that I have never actually harmed anyone, just been verbally aggressive. I am on lithium 1200mg, epilim 1500mg and sertraline 100mg.  
Can you get anxiety symptoms even if you aren't feeling anxious? Why do they come about randomly? And then that's what starts making you feel anxious? I don't get it.... 
I have been with my partner for nearly 9 years, we met at school when we were 18 and have been together ever since â although it has been a very difficult relationship to be in a lot of the time.  I think I have always thought that someone hasnât been quite right with him, he suffers with OCD and has always expressed quite often strange or unrealistic views about things. He seems to find it hard to maintain any meaningful long-term relationships with friends, and a lot of the time because of his behaviour, I get the impression a lot of people donât like him or think heâs a bit of an a**ehole â which he can be at times, but knowing him better than anyone else, I see past this not so nice side of him, and the person I love is a caring, happy and fun person to be around and he is my best friend in the whole world.  One of the things over the years that has made me question whether there is something more to his behaviour, is his inability to stick at anything, including our relationship. I know he loves me, but from about 1 year onwards, nearly once a year heâd start to be really horrible to me and tell me he wasnât happy and didnât want to be with me anymore, Iâd be devastated, but this might only last a couple of days, then heâd be really sorry, tell me he did love me and weâd go back to normal again. About 5 years ago, having been in a really good job, earning good money for about 4 years, he decided he wanted to pack it in and go into the army, this involved him taking a salary that was half the amount he had been earning previously, and I knew he would hate it â he had this totally unrealistic view on what it would be like, he would be thinking about the parades and all the glory and pride associated with this job and not the reality of what it would be like day to day. I tried to reason with him over it, but when he has something in his mind, everyone around him could think what he is doing is crazy, but it will make perfect sense to him and there is no reasoning with him at all. So he left his job, joined the army and after about a week I was waking up to messages from him absolutely desperate, hating it, needing to come home â which is what happened after 4 weeks, this was the earliest he was allowed to leave. After he came home, he was lucky and managed to re-join his previous line of work quite quickly, we went through a period about a year of things being really good and probably the most settled they have been.  He then changed his job again last October, which was a sensible move for progression, but quite a big change, and this totally unsettled everything again. About a month before he started, I found he had ordered some form of anti-depressants via an online pharmacy, he was obviously feeling quite bad at this point and didnât feel able to go to the doctors to be paying £100 for a prescription, when he could have gone to the local GP! I was really concerned, but tried to support him, he wouldnât tell me exactly what he was taking, but he was a little better for about a month, but he stupidly finished the prescription, thought he didnât need them anymore because he felt better and didnât take them anymore â things have just spiralled in the last year from this point.  When he started his new job at the end of October last year, he met a girl on his training course, who he began an affair with. He was normally a very health conscious person and had a lot of anxiety issues usually around âneedingâ to go to the gym and eat healthily etc. this all stopped, he stopped exercising, ate rubbish and began going out with her after work or back to her house and drinking (large amounts) every night â half of the time he wouldnât come home, he was getting into trouble at work for their stupid behaviour â all totally out of character for him. We were arguing a lot about the amount of time he was spending with her and he would just insist he was having fun and she was a friend. I think she was an escape from his real life and facing up to his responsibilities. I felt I was losing the person I loved and my best friend, he was becoming unrecognisable. When I would quite rightfully question his behaviour if heâd not been home for a few days, heâd blow up â he just wanted to come home and have a ânice time with meâ, he try and blame me as the reason for his behaviour and why he wouldnât come home. This went on until March, I think it was the glimpses of the person I loved that I would see occasionally for a couple of days that kept me going for that long, but when I found out for sure that he had been cheating on me, our relationship ended and he moved out to be with her.  He was only there a few days, said their relationship was never going to work out and he ending up staying with his parents. I kept my distance from him for about 3 months, I was terrified of seeing him, because I knew Iâd take him back. After about 3 months, he was contacting me a lot, full of remorse, he seemed like the person I fell in love with again, eventually I agreed to meet and it was amazing just to see him and be with him again, and we got back together and he moved back home very shortly after that â probably too quickly in hindsight.  During the time weâd not been together, he told me of how he had slept with a lot of different women, but that it wasnât what he wanted, he loved me and that was all he wanted to focus on now. After a great first month together, where weâd booked a holiday for a few weeksâ time, he heard from the girl he had cheated on me with, went to meet her and told me he was leaving me again. He went to her, but then came back after a couple of days, saying he did love me and wanted to be with me.  Since then, this has probably happened about 8 times â I know if people knew theyâd think I was crazy for staying with him, but I know that this isnât really him. I know deep down he loves me and he wants our relationship to work more than anything, but when he goes through these cycles of mood swings, he will say he knows he is doing the wrong thing and heâll regret it, but he canât stop himself. After a couple of days he can come back and be totally he old self again â it almost feels like Iâm in a relationship with two totally different people. His relationship with this girl has also got him into more trouble at work and he is currently being investigated for gross misconduct and could lose his job as a result, which isnât helping his stress levels â or mine!  There is so much more, but I am certain that he behaviour is the result of a condition such as bi polar, he is under the doctor at the moment, but just for depression, he is taking citalopram, but I donât think he tells the doctor half of what is going on really â I think he just says he feels low etc. so the GP prescribes him the anti-depressants, which he doesnât take properly a lot of the time. Heâs gone from being on 40mg to stopping them dead and then feeling really unwell as a result. He has been taking them again at 20mg now for about a month, but I donât think they are really helping him. He stopped letting me go to doctorsâ appointments with him, so I canât tell the doctor what I have witnessed behaviour wise etc.  I realise this is a really long post, but I am desperate now and have no idea what to do, I have suggested that he may have something like bi polar and he dismisses it, I donât think he has a concept of ârealityâ at the moment and doesnât realise he is on the verge of ruining his life. I understand it must be hard to accept that you have something like this, but I think thatâs because he doesnât really know anything about the condition and doesnât want to be labelled as having something like that. He will often say that he knows he is all over the place and that itâs a nightmare to be him and be inside his head, but I just want him to get proper help.  Any advice anyone can give would be so much appreciated, it is really lonely to be in this relationship at the moment, I donât feel I can really tell my friends and family because a lot of them would just think he is treating me really badly and think I shouldnât be with him, I donât think they would accept that his behaviour might be caused by something like this. I love him with all my heart and Iâm not ready to give up on him yet, but I am terrified if he doesnât change, that he will ruin my life and his own.       
I am currently attending my first year of university living in the dorms, and believe that I am suffering from some sort of depression. I want to just have some clarity on the matter, and get some things off my chest. In my family my brother and one of my aunts have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but Iâm not sure if Iâm bipolar. In grade twelve of high school I told my mother once that I thought I might be slightly bipolar as well, but she quickly assured me that I wasnât. I do believe I have a slightly different persona when Iâm with my family though, but Iâm not really sure. For my brother, I donât really donât see him all that often due to the fact that I live with my mother, and he lives with my father. Also, we donât really get along that well, and I try to avoid him. My brother is in his mid 20âs, and doesnât take his prescriptions, and is really heavy into drugs. This is where we usually butt heads, and my brother refuses to see he has a problem. Iâm a bit of a hypercritic though because before I got to university I used to smoke weed, and have done mushrooms on occasion, but not to the same extreme. The one thing I do find about myself is that I donât really have anger attacks or really get all that angry in general. My brother though sometimes has really bad anger explosions where the littlest things can set him off, which is apparently common in people diagnosed with being bipolar?  For my grade twelve year during December I felt really in the dumps, and was only getting around six hours of sleep each night. During the winter vacation my one good friend of mine, and myself smoked a lot of marijuana, and some mushrooms (which we had also done over this summer and the last summer as well. I know probably not the smartest of choices). After winter vacation I felt really refreshed, and started to feel a lot more confident in myself, but that only lasted around 2 weeks.  After that I reverted to my normal introverted self.  For my university life I donât believe that my anxiety or feeling like sh*t has to do with being stressed about moving out or to do with my school work. In general Iâve never really cared about getting good grades, and It doesnât really bother me about moving out. As of late though I find it really difficult to go to all of my classes, and usually end up skipping half of them. If it wasnât for my friends that come to my room before certain classes we have together, or to come grab me to hang out, I doubt that I would leave my room. Also, Iâve been sleeping a lot lately, and my sleep cycle is way out of whack. One day I managed to sleep for 15 hours. Iâm not sure if any of my friends have realized that Iâve been in the dumps as of late. I usually try to keep on a manly guy façade, but in reality Iâm rather sensitive. We usually just shotgun beers, and play shot for shot, and other typical dumb university stuff. An old friend of mine from my small home town also lives in the same building as myself, and somehow we started talking about drugs, and he stated that havenât Iâve done mushrooms before. To be honest it cut pretty deep when he said that. Most of the people that I hang around are all straight A students who probably havenât ever seen real drugs in their life, while I have 40+ pot plants growing in my back yard at my dadâs. Just thinking about my disgust toward my brother, I wonder what they think of me, even though I stopped doing that, which was mostly because of my distaste for my brother.  As of late I find myself not wanting to do anything, and Iâve come to the conclusion that I really dislike trying. Also, Iâve been having more frequent thoughts of suicide. I doubt Iâd ever actually do it though. I have another brother who is slightly older than I, who I am really close to. We sometimes joke how weâre the only normal ones in our family (I think he might be the only oneâ¦). I always think about how devastated heâd be if Iâ¦ and usually cry like a little bitch. I donât really want to talk to anyone about this, because I feel like people will look at me differently or pity me, and I hate that. Should I go to a doctor without telling anyone? I honestly donât understand depression at all, and have no clue what to do. 
I am 50 and was dating a 23 years old guy over the internet. We stayed together for 7 incredible months. He dumped me 1 year ago and since then I am extremely sad and hopeless. All my life I gave too much importance to my romantic relatioships. Every time I had a breakup I became very depressive. I was diagnose with bipolar when I was 16 years. I feel I am too old for crying over a relationship, it seems too pathetic having believed that that boy and I would work. I feel as if it was my last chance to find love. 
4 weeks ago I've begun taking lithium but still not feeling any difference- actually, my depression has been very bad lastly. How long did it take for lithium to work for you (in case anyone has actually taken it)? 
I am suffering  this disorder from 18 years and i was searching 4 balance almost 10 years... and now it is done and i would like to share my story... 
I take citalopram on a daily and the last couple of months have been rough and since Saturday I have been having a hard time with anxiety counselor says I got depressed betond my medicine and I just have to wait until I calm down and I will be OK? Anyone else ever dealt with this  
My FiL has recently been taken off his anti-depressants on a reducing dose, but is still on the lithium and aripiprazole.  He remains flat in mood and low in initiative.  Has anyone out there had any success at coming off meds to improve engagement and interaction?  If so, we'd love to hear from you. 
I've been on quetiapene for two weeks and two days. First 300mg for one week then 600mg the second. My consultant doesn't seem to care about the depression I feel at night on this drug. It drives me to binge for the pain - I'm inpatient and informal. I didn't take my Quetiapene last night and I noticed some nausea this morning. Will quitting cold turkey after 2 weeks and 2 days be easy? I can withstand the nausea. I'm planning on going to my GP when I move from the city I am in now, in hospital to another city, back home, and seeing what they said. I should be out of hospital next weekend. But is it ok to quit when I've only been taking it for such a short period, or am I in for a bad withdrawal? Also minor headache but I can deal with that.  
Quetiapene XL 600mg has decreased my mania a lot, but I start getting depressed at around 6pm. I'm inpatient, informal as of today... But my consultant won't mix these medications. Fluoxetine was really helping my depression and eating disorder. Is there a reason these two don't mix? 
I was first diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Then my diagnosis changed to rapid cycling bipolar (mostly the manic type). I get depressed at night though.   At first I was in the Priory (NHS overflow) and they put me on a mood stabiliser and told me they would reintroduce Fluoxetine 40MG when I'm stable to treat my OCD and eating disorder (mostly food obsession at the time). I was doing really well and was made informal for the first time in 2-3 months of chaos.  I was then recalled to an NHS hospital and they suddenly took me off everything and started me on an Anti-psychotic called Quetiapene. I had a health diet of 2000-2500 calories per day. For my first week on Quetiapene I was on 300mg and my appetite increased to 3000-4000 calories. For my second week on Quetiapene I was on 600mg and my appetite increased to 4000-5000+ calories per day. I have gained 10lbs in 2 weeks and my non-fasted blood glucose levels were borderline diabetic. My section 2 runs out in a few days on the 1st of December. If I tell my consultant I do not want to take Quetiapene due to these side effects but am willing to stay informal to get on the right medication, will she place me on a section 3 if she wants me to stay on Quetiapene? The weight gain is causing me emotional distress where I just binge and cry at night. There is also the blood glucose problem. Do I have a right and do I stand a chance or does this depend on the consultant? I am panicking because I may have to tongue my meds if she presses them because a section 3 would be a career ruined for me as I am a technology consultant and most job interviews ask if I have ever been placed under section 3 of the mental health act. Please can someone clear this up for me? Do I have a right to refuse Quetiapene due to the side effects? 
I have had bipolar type 1 disorder for 14 years now. I had put complete faith in my psychiatrist that he would always prescribe the correct drugs for me. For the past two years, I have been on Epilim, Lithium and Sertraline and was experiencing lots of horrible side effects, including numbness from the waist down. I looked up my side effects on the Internet, only to find that Sertraline is not compatible with lithium. Please be aware of mistakes. Please look up combinations before going ahead with them. I wouldn't want anyone else to go through the same thing. Thanks. 
Help... I placed a post up last week regarding my partner who was heading into a severe depression and sadly it has not become any better since starting on meds. Infact if anything it is worse and he has now decided to cut contact with everyone, including me, for a few weeks to help him get better. I am already worried sick about him and don't know what I can do, I'm in constant tears. Any advice on the best way forward and what, if anything, I can do to help him? 
My son called me last week in tears because he doesn't know what to do about his partner's behavior.  She is also the mother of his children.  I was aware that she has had emotional issues over the years. Angry outbursts, depression mostly from what I knew.  He has recently found out that she has been in touch with an old boyfriend and sending him messages that were inappropriate. They did get together once according to my daughter-in-law but did not have sex.  She, as most people do, denied everything but this quickly turned to anger and accusations to my son that it was his fault because he didn't "love" her.  This is absolutely not true.  He has supported her and her son for 14 years as well as their own children.  He loves her very much and even moved from where he had lived for his whole life to the city she grew up in so she would be closer to her family.  I won't go on about this but suffice to say he has been a good husband and father. These are the reasons I think she may have bipolar. 1) bouts of depression, low self esteem 2) guilt about what has happened in the past 3) change in mood from happy, laughing and talking about future plans     to flashes of anger and/or sulky behavior 4) partying with sexual behavior with other people (male and female) 5) loves my son one minute and threatens to call the police and have     him removed from the house and says she will say anything to      accomplish this. (he has this on his cell phone in a text) 6) threatens suicide - even in front of their children If anyone has any thoughts on this I would appreciate it.  I don't want to suggest this may be the problem to my son unless I have more information.  I love them both and just want her to get the help she needs because they are both hurting and it isn't healthy to be living like this for them or my precious grandchildren. Thank you,    
Hello,     I have a question, how i can check that my family member had a electroconvulsive therapy in England. This man is now on hospital in England.     Thank you for your help 
so me and my boyfriend have been dating me 2 years, we are both 18 and are first loves. Till about 4 months in, he showed very few signs of anger, he would sometimes get irritated easily, but nothing that was upsetting. when he did show his anger, he would cause me, my friends and family a lot of stress, he stopped me seeing my friends and doesnt like my family because they dont like how he treats me when hes angry.  so for about a year he was horrible to me, nearly breaking up with me every week and i had no freedom, but when he was kind, he was amazing and thats when i would love him and be happy and i know i should love him and be happy all time! however i stayed with him! about 3 months ago, he told me he just found out he had bipolar and that he felt we needed a break for him to go sort himself out, get some counselling and stuff, i respected this and during that time, i sadly was not scared anymore, i felt free, i felt like i wasnt being watched all the time and i wasnt as sad as i thought i would have been. so we didnt see or talk to eachother for about 2 weeks, he called me up and said he missed me and loved and wanted to get back together, he had calmed down and wasnt the angry person he was before, foolishly in love, we got back together and true enough he had calmed down, occasionally he would get aggitated! but way less than he used to, up until about 3 weeks ago, when he found out his a level results and he didnt do all that well, so naturally he has been upset about them and i understand that! however he has become angry and rude to me again!! over little things, like one time i had no signal and once i got my signal back, i got all these texts from him because i hadnt replied straight back to him, (this was while i was on a shopping trip with my sister) and he was being very angry and rude to me and kept calling me and texting me and i was scared, it was happening all over again and i said i dont deserve this, i do so much for you, you cant talk to me like this when i havent done anything and so i said i you can call me when you calmed down and so i didnt look at my phone until he had!  another example was yesterday, now i very rarely am able to go out with my friends, he has slowly been letting me, yesterday was one of my best friends birthday party and hes not allowed to come, because my friends dont like him. but during the party, i made sure to check my phone if he texted, because otherwise he would get made if i didnt! i was having a good time tho and didnt wanna be on my phone the whole time! i was dancing and having fun ( i wasnt drinking tho, he doesnt allow me too) anyway, at one point i didnt look at my phone for about 10 mins and when i looked at it, he had texted me asked what i was doing and i hadnt seen the text and so he had called me, texted me loads and was getting very angry that i hadnt replied. he of course thught i was cheating!! which i havent! whenever hes angry he always calls me a liar and a cheat, when im not, i havent done anything to make him think i am! and i was so upset, he was being horrible and angry and i had to get my best!! friend to help me deal with it, becaue i didnt wanna go through this anger again on my own and he eventually calmed down, but then he got angry about 3 more times during the night and i ended up crying and wasnt looking at my phone again, because i was too scared to talk to him!!  when i got home i finally texted him and he said sorry, and then he went on to say he was depressed, addicted to weed (which he has like everyday to help calm him and i've said he shouldn't rely on it for relaxation) and wanted to kill himself (he has said this a lot to me, to threatened me btw) and i said he needs to go see a doctor and that this isn't an excuse to treat me badly. he went to the doctor today and they are gonna give him anti depressants and ritalin. he then got angry at me again and he always blames me for his anger, but i literally do nothing wrong and if i ever do anything i take responsibility for it! but i'm not ever doing anything wrong!! and he keeps blaming me and getting angry at me and pushing me away! i don't want to be pushed away tho, i love him so much!!! i suggested we take a break, so he can like sort himself out, but he said he wouldn't sort himself out if we did that, because he would be too upset! we had a long phone conversation and sorted some things out, even though i know he is still blaming me for his anger (which is really upsetting) im a good person, im not an angry person, i dont do things to make him angry or upset, i do as he tells me, which is unheathy, because i do it because im scared of him! he knows this! he knows he doesnt deserve me and he said i can find a better man that will treat me as i should be tearted and truthfully i know i can too! and im leaning towards it, because i cannot be continued to be treated so badly! but then i love him so much and dont want to lose him, but im afradi i may have to, because im not going through that year of anger that i did!!!! it took a toll on me!!! and ive only just come out of it!  please give me some advice, i dont know what to do, i dont know how to deal with bipolar, im afraid hes gonna kill himself!!

Hello, I am new to this group. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder II 3 years ago. I'm 30 and have been on and off anti depressants sinnce i was 18. I've managed studies and career by "miracle", by working very hard in the phases when I was not depressed. My problem is have have no real friend. I have never been able to keep them for long, as I disappear when I feel down and decline all invites, and people probably think I'm rude. I've had a boyfriend for one year who I don't love and really want to quit.  I'm wondering if i should tell the few friends I have about my illness? Maybe they would understand why I occasionnally have a strange behaviour, but it could just as well drive them away.  What is your experience this? 
Hi, I've been dealing with this for around 5-6 years but only been diagnosed 3 years. I feel like I'm in this constant cycle in life and can't stay motivated I've tried a few medications and they just drain me, I was thinking about trying lamotrigine (which if anyone's tried if they could give their experience it would be great).  I was told I'm rapid-cycling because I can be up for a matter of hours and fall back into being depressed, I hear about people getting over this and doing well but I can't seem to. If anyone could give me tips on how to motivate myself and how to know what makes it easier to cope.  I've tried mood diaries, planning my days, things like that but I can't seem to actually stick to anything. I feel physically exhausted most of the time, medications haven't worked and I got painkillers for my pcos which im pretty much self medicating with, I go through a fortnights worth in less than a week and obviously the week after is horrible and I can't keep that up. Sorry for the rant but I'd appreciate anything at all, thanks x 
Hi i am new to this sort of self help stuff and have always brushed my issues off as being lazy but its time to find out once and for all.   This may sound stupid so be kind if it is coz its hard enough writing it down even if it is to strangers. So most of my life from when I remember being a nice from the age of around 8-9 till now the ripe old age of 28 I have always been interested in trying so many new hobbies etc. The thing is I have always found it just as satisfying if not more so by idly staying in my room thinking about doing the things rather than doing them. I've always put it down to laziness but I was in the army for four years and loved doing pt and was always at a high level of fitness. I thought I once heard of a mental illness/issue that was the same but can't think when or where or if I'm making it up  I have spent practically 20 years accepting it but just recently i have started on a journey to delve back into my last and clear up all the things I have struggled with and kept quiet. The school yard to the army barracks aren't exactly the easiest places to bring these things up although they encourage it you don't want to make out as if your mad and have people treat you different especially when you struggle for confidence and have history of mild depression. I definitely have given up for the past 20 years on accepting any help after school out my behavioural issues down to depression and put me on these pills that did me no good not even as a placebo. I have struggled for a long time with what is normal and what is not and if I need help or pills but only now have decided to stop fannying around and let it play so much on my mind and my life. This is turning into a bit of a rant but I haven't delay with a lot of stuff that has always led me to do loads of drugs and drink to excess and generally go from one addiction to the other to deal with my problems that probably could have been dealt with through talking as a fifteen year old school kid. Now I'm 28 almost 29 I guess its time to admit defeat and ask around as to what the best course of action is but being the age I am now is harder to accept and admit that I could have mental health problems. I'll get over the embarrassment soon as I have come this far and really want to make the next 20 years full of things I actually want to do instead of just lie thinking about. That is the main one I am wondering about as lying thinking about the things and getting the satisfaction without the failure or embarrassment is getting to me coz I have tried so many things oover the years from basic mechanics to farming and various hobbies that I have been happier to do in my mind which sounds mad but is there something behind that or just pure laziness? I get that fear of failing and being anxious is part of it but that shouldn't stop me wanting to try rather than getting actual satisfaction out of it the thought of doing it and t How good I can make myself believe. Reading that makes me sound mental so please don't be too harsh as its a big step even getting this far. The this g with all the depression and things that as a kid its the norm these days and people use it as a crutch. I have a few friends with diagnosed issues like bipolar that the use to the extreme as to not be normal when it suits them and I don't want to put a label on myself just coz of having some drama that I have never really gone into from my childhood. Just chose to accept it and get off my face which has also made me paranoid to the point of psychosis sometimes but it comes and goes and hasn't been bad since I stepped away from the circle and friends I was keeping.  The main reason I am finally getting to this point Of admitting something is wrong is because I have met this amazing girl who im living with and dont wamt to be the easily moody dick that cant explain why to her amd push her away. If anyone can give me some sound advice on the issues I have never dealt with or even the best next step which I guess is seeing a doctor or just telling me I'm being stupid and to get a grip would be best and the first option would make it very real and a bit scary as the pills from when I was a kid made it worse and finding a doctor who won't judge or laugh or tell me its all in my head. This is the first step and a big one for me as I have pushed away family who have always known something isn't right but never wanted to accept that I was wrong or seriously messed up. Anyway thanks for the rant I feel better hoping to get some serious responses as to much banter might make me question this while process and don't want to spend another twenty odd years being miserable and losing my .issus would suck. Done thanks again 
Don't get me wrong I'm proud of everything I've that done, but it doesn't feel enough.. I hate my bipolar.. I want to get rid of it  
I have been dating a very sweet guy for the past 6 months. He has had terrible relationships from the past all ending with everyone walking away from him and not helping him. I dont want to be like the others, and im trying my best to be there for him and support him in any way i can. Its seems he goes from loving so deeply to hating so strongly. We have great moments we share and i guess thats what keeps me holding on...but then he gets angry. He gets insecure easily, he feels im to busy or i never have time for him...but the truth is im always making time for him. I lately found out on friday that he is talking to other females on the phone sexually and also saying he loves them...i have not talked to him since friday night. He called me on sat, but i didnt pick up, and i havent heard from him since. I feel  that when he feels rejected he acts out impulsively. im stuck between what i should do, or how can i help...or maybe i need to just walk away..

I am not epileptic but was diagnosed a year ago as suffering Bipolar II disorder. I started on 50mg  - 25 x morning and night at August last year.  It helped stabilise down from hypomanic but by Christmas I was had descended to very low mood, lethargy, and not caring about myself, others or everyday tasks.    My dosage was increased a week ago by just 25mg. Already I am feeling energised, 'high' and capable of almost anything I set my mind too.  However I'm showing the symptoms of  facial rash, some diarrhoea, sickness and sleeplessness which are all recognised side effects. The new energy rush is enjoyable in a way. The butterflies in the tummy, the increase in creativity etc., are all beneficial but I am scared of going back up to full-blown hypomania which blighted my life for months last spring. Besides I can't afford to spend another £13K in a few weeks of madness.    Is anyone else experiencing similar difficulties with this drug  GG

I've accomplished so much at such a young age & I'm completely proud of myself but it tend to feel like it's not enough; there's a lot missing & I just can't get my hands on it just yet ... so it affects me mentally & emotional & very strong at that & because of this it's affecting my relationship (in my eyes) ... I've met the Love of my Life & He ... fell in love with someone who has "issues"  I want out ... </3 
I take an anti-depressant and mood stabilizer for bipolar. I'm about to make a change to my antidepressant and this is always difficult. My psychiatrist gives me a short course of zopiclone during any stressful times. I'm going to need a daytime sedative too and don't want to take diazepam, it relaxes me for about 1-2 hours and then I get rebound agitation worse than how I felt initially. Can anyone please suggest some other anti-anxiety meds, (for short term use only)?   
I am a 61 year old male. It feels that I have gone through  a hedge backwards ... I seeked help as I felt so low, to end my life was a serious option ... Months later after many drugs, tears, nightmares weird dreams panic attacks etc, feeling really rough and the diagnosis of being bi-polar  I decided things werev getting out of hand ... I stopped all medication (advising my GP) and sat tight and requested a second opinion.  Things have got better after drying out ... and at times I feel OK ... however I tink this is due to me no longer working , or interact with people except my wife as these are triggers to me and cause me problems ... my anger threshold is quite low so if I feel people are blocking me or just being awckward (especially say a medical secretary trying to stop me seeing a doctor or send an email etc) the rage takes over and it takes hours for me to release .... I have had a meeting with a new psychiatrist and he has an open mind on the first bi-polar diagnosis due to my age .... however as   mentioned to him , when I undertake say three bi-polar screen tests . they all seem to come back more than positive .... I am now a little confused now as to where I am and what I am ..... any suggestions please ?  
Neuroscientists at UCLA have shown that lithium, long the standard treatment for bipolar disorder, increases the amount of gray matter in the brains of patients with the illness.   physorg.com/news95351363.html  Interesting reading.

Can a person, who is diagnosed bipolar affective disorder patient 15 years ago, who regularly takes prescribed medicine but who had three unsuccessful suicide attempts, write valid will? 
I have a friend whose mother, sister and brother have bipolar. She recently met someone and she is afraid to progress the relationship into something more serious because she is worried that if she ever has children they will have it too. What are the chances? She doesn't have bipolar. 
Hi,  After searching the internet I am positive that my daughter is bipolar but how do I go about getting her diagnosed and start her on any necessary treatment?  I have taken her to our GP who after 5 minutes said she was not Bipolar but I don't see how she would know after a five minute chat!  I was thinking of starting a mood chart - does anyone have any ideas that may help?  Thanks 
I don't know if this is bipolar or what but I feel normal, happy buy it's like literally seconds, up down up down, my mind is racing but no matter what I can't get out of this mood. I know I'm not going crazy, but it am on anti depressants so maybe they are triggering the affect. It's like I'm hyper, in a good mood but I know back of my mind I shouldn't be functioning like this. Please help it's the most wierd sensation ever. Could it be the antidepressants as I was put on them but I'm not sure I needed them. 
My doc thinks I need. It would be a break from my elderly mother whom I care for. I am too depressive and need some stimulus. What do you think guys, has any of you gone to a mental institution during a depression, and did it by your own? 
Hi all,  After being referred by my GP following a couple of manic episodes, I finally saw someone from the mental health team in my area yesterday.  I was diagnosed with depression 4 years ago and have been on SSRI antidepressants (citalopram) ever since - I haven't had any problems with them.  As I mentioned, I've now had a couple of manic episodes which were cause for concern, so my appointment with the psych was to discuss the possibility of me having bipolar.  The meeting was only 20 minutes long (I expected it to be over an hour), and at the end she told me that she couldn't diagnose me due to the complexity of bipolar, but that I should go back and speak to my GP about being put on sertraline to see if it changes anything.  She said that a large number of people with bipolar take sertraline.  I've since researched it, and discovered that it's an SSRI - not much different to my current medication - and some websites suggest that it's actually more prone to giving people manic episodes.  I'm quite concerned about this, understandably, and I'm wondering why on earth she would suggest something like this.  So, what I'm asking is - has anyone been put on sertraline for bipolar/suspected bipolar, and if so, what happened?  Any experience or knowledge on the subject would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks,  Em.  PS - I've cross posted this across both the bipolar forums and the sertraline forums, I hope that's ok.

Hi ive been bipolar for over a year i was diagnosed with affective bi polar disorder with psycotic symptoms in october last year. i believe im getting better my mum and docter says so. I was wondering if there is any way of smoking weed again after i recover just becuase it helps me to relax sometimes and i miss that feeling, will it trigger anything with my bi polar after i get better. ive only done it once while on meds and it didnt affect me at all? 
I am using this site less now because i am getting better,I do think i had a fair amount of the depressive symptoms many of you descibe and of which burdened me for a lot of my life,BUT with patience understanding and people supporting me through the bad since February this year i am now seeing the sunshine again.Combination of quatiapine/lithium seems to be the magic formula for me so far and i am embracing these drugs rather than deriding them.I have had a back to work meeting that went well and have even  survived my mum being really quite ill in hospital.I am sad to read so many distraught posts of late so hope some of my well docmented experiences may give hope that mental illness particulary mania/depression can be treated effectively.Today i sat next to my learner driver daughter as we took a drive around Oxon something i couldn't have done even a month  ago,to all of you i send my very best wishes for improvement in your mental health.    
I'm really concerned I have bipolar disorder. My gp even laughed at me and just me antidepressants so that didn't help. I have been trying to distractive myself with creative outlets, I'm a jazz musician, a digital artist, I've even started coding, its rediculious. I'm getting worse, I hate to think what I'll be like in a few years from now.  I was hoping to find another avenue for help. Feeling pretty lost, I can't even talk to friends anymore.

 Maybe i am just fortunate that my personality appears to be glass half full kinda girl BUT i am now on 125mgs of Quetiapine for last 2 wks and in the last 10 days feel more like myself having been very unwell since beginning of February.I could go up to 150mgs but at present feel i don't want to,I sleep for 8hrs ,bit shaky on waking but it soon goes,energy,mood general being seems much more stable.Review with psychiatrist early july.Considering phased return back to nursing in September ,a month ago i'd have ditched nursing altogether.Is there going to be a downside i wonder?? 
Please can someone confirm whether Bi-polar runs in families.  
Hi, we have been together 3 years and have a 16 month old baby. She is a very good mum but I cant help notice her severe mood swings are getting worse. She has been put on anti-depressants but this doesn't seem to help. She has recently started cutting me off. We split up in June last year which is when she was prescribed her anti-d's. We never really spoke in that time as she cut me off then but one day randomly called me up in tears and practically begged me to get back with her which made my world. Since being back together she now has up days and down days and when she is up she is a pleasure to be around but when she is down she can be nasty. She always says I am trying to control her because I simply ask how her day was and ask who she went out with. I ask out of interest as she is my gf and love talking to her. But now she seems to think I am out to get her. She often turns to drink after we have had a row and then when she has calmed down is she is sorry for everything and apologises for her actions and it wont happen again. Then less than a week later we are further back than when we started. She isn't violent towards me but has stuck fists through doors and stuff. I might ask her what she fancies for dinner and world war 3 is on its way because I said I dont feel like chicken or something silly. She will then change, I recognise this straight away by her breathing, twitchy behaviour, zoning out (daydreaming), the reach for a bottle or pack of fags and if its fags one won't do. I am not an angel but it is now at the point where I feel I am walking on eggshells around her. The latest thing is why I am asking for help because I love her dearly I really do but I need help on how to one: approach her about it, two: where to look for help and three: if there is anything wrong with her at all or is it me being to picky. This is how we currently stand. She said she was going out friday and saturday this weekend which doesn't bother me as such apart from the fact she told me she wanted nothing to do with me a fortnight ago then on wenesday just gone she she done the whole she has made a mistake wants me back apologised and I said if she wants our relationship to get better then we need to work on it. She said ok sounded all happy and that again. Friday came and she said that she would be round saturday so I could cook her dinner before she went out. I was delighted and eager to cook a nice meal to show I wanted to make an effort. She went out friday and we never spoke until the saturday morning. I asked if she had a good night and she told me yes great. All good are we actually getting somewhere. I asked what she wanted for dinner and got the stuff out she was off to get an outfit for that night then coming to mine to eat and get ready. By now 6 hours has gone its half 4 I havent heard from her so ring her mobile flat battery. Ring her sister as thats who she went with and they werent together so I rang her flatmate and just asked if she had been in contact he said no so left message. I then got through to her half an hour later and she picked up the phone and screamed at me asking why I was so controlling. I didnt think being concerned was a crime was just ringing to see if she was ok and what time she was over as it was getting late to which I got the reply. Why would I come and have dinner with someone who aint happy unless I am controlling her every move. I am now blocked on phone, whattsapp and fb. Please help me try and understand where I am going wrong or if indeed may be correct in thinking that maybe its not just depression she is suffering from. Look forward to some kind of response. 
Just been diagnosed as cyclothymic this week (Bipolar III to some).  Am on anti-depressants and mood stabilizers.  Currently hypomanic after major depressive disorder and nervous breakdown 3 years ago.  Diagnosed with depression and borderline personality disorder. (oh, and OCD and anxiety taboot)  I belive it is bipoloar II, not cyclothymia because I HAVE had major depression and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, not mild to moderate depression as cyclothymia requires.  Also, I have had a history of serious depressions and have been medicated for this a few times since early adulthood.  Because of my unstable, rapid cycling moods, my initial diagnosis was borderline personality disorder.  My psychiatrist said it was just me (my personality) and I would have to learn to live with it.  He offered no help.  What criteria must be reached in order to get a bipolar II diagnosis?  Were 3 suicide attempts, 18 months of being mainly bed-ridden through depression and 2 years of therapy and drugs not enough to afford this diagnosis?  I don't understand.  Why won't my psychiatrist make a diagnosis?  My GP diagnosed the cyclothymia.  Please help.  I need to understand. Potty P x   
Hi all, I have suffered with anx and depression for many years, but lately bipolar has been mentioned by my therapist. Could I run through my main symptoms and you kind people can give an opinion?  I have bad anxiety most of the time, I don't have a classic high, my high is more about lack of need for sleep, don't seem to need much food, loads of creative work going on and I get really out of sorts if I'm interrupted. My downs happen generally after a high time of a few weeks,  then I just crash out - dont want to do anything or talk to anyone 
At present I have no friends, no love relationship, and no job. My finances are destroyed and I can't engage in any activity. I live with my 84 year old mother, and I only see sickness and death ahead of me. I need to engage myself in something, I used to be quite talented in many areas, but during this phase of depression I can't access any of my good qualities. Days are so empty. I wish I could find some kind of activity. 
I am almost sixty and suffered se ere anxiety (GAD) periodically all my life . A year ago I finally got the correct diagnosizyof bipolar 2 affective disorder. Just knowing the medicos had worked it out (at last!!!) Was a relief.I am taking low dose of Lamotrigine / Lamictal which is helping stabilise my mood. I do not abuse drugs,alcohol or live dangerously. I've worked full time all my life and am not a typical sufferer of bipolar so before diagnosis I was frightened that I had gone mad. Truly, deeply mad. My worst phazse is the hypomanic episodes as I can control anxiety and fear. I can't control the highs. It seems part of the problem is my very high j Intelligence and a?so having been subjected to extreme abuse as a child in care homes. I never knew my parents and was raised in children's homes. Such children are classic bipolar sufferers. The oint is that it doesn't matter what route took you to bipolarity but what route you choose to balance your reactions and manage your condition. So what if your drug or other substance abuse brought you to this. There are treatment options. There is support. Just this page is a start. So what,s stopping you getting on with your life? You are. Get on with it. Start now, this moment. If you want change its inside you. Grab it.    Art

Hi everyone I just need some advice. I am taking 40mg fluoxetine and have now been introduced a mood stabiliser "aripiprazole" by my psychiatrist so far so good but i am only on day 5. I specifically told him that i did not want a mood stabiliser that causes weight gain cause then i will definetely make sure i die.  Has anyone had any experience with Abilfy (aripiprazole)???

Is there anyone else on here in the same position? His Mum also has it. He has been on many different meds over the years and atm is quite stable on 550mg quetiapine xl. will his meds of effected the baby?  
About 18 months ago I went to see my GP as I wasn't feeling mentally right. After being referred it turned out I had quite severe anxiety. As I have a young child (who was a young baby at the time) I gave up the therapy sessions after only a couple of months. I couldn't put the time into the exercises I was supposed to be on evenings, due to working full time and having a young family. Shortly after stopping the sessions, my ex girlfriend finished me as things weren't right for a few months. We hadn't got on etc. I was moody and down a lot of the time and seemed to take my mood on o it her.  Since then ive got worse, it's now been around ten months and I'm noticing the following: Massive downs for no reason after being ok Feeling depressed on the way to work, head sometimes slumped at an angle Zero motivation at work, difficult to concentrate and often things going in one ear and out of the other Indecisiveness I.e. when I'm at home I struggle to decide what to do and in what order, such ad cleaning, ironing etc. I know end up wasting a lot of time unnecessarily mulling things over. Rash decisions, spent thousands in savings in the past ten months  Inability to stay home on weekends, feeling so agitated that I have to go to the pub. Probably only been one or two Fridays in the last ten months when ive not had alcohol  Mood swings with those closest to me such as as my mum, and previously ex girlfriend  Generally quite agitated if I'm not getting quick(ish) text responses from current girlfriend  Stress at work/worrying about things   I'm hoping I don't have any bipolar or depression so I was wondering what people on here thought? I know from my previous dealings with the NHS that they are painfully slow with referrals.  
So my boyfriend of 8 month has bipolar I knew about it and told him how when he has his bad days I will stand by him yesterday he told me how he is in a dark place and has decided to cut off everyone he cares about including me as he feels like everyone he comes into contact with he eventually drags them down and he doesnât want to do that to me. I have told him that I love him and Iâm here for him no matter what but he keeps saying that he has made a decision and with that he has to make a sacrifice of letting everyone he loves go as it will be too much to bare for anyone and he needs to know that Iâm safe and wonât get hurt. He wonât tell me his decision heâs made which scares me and when ever I try to reassure him that I am here for him no matter what he says that I need to forget about him and that he loves me so much he has to let me go for the reason that he will hurt me not physically but will slowly make me feel the way he is and he doesnât want that I have talked to a few of my friends who have said itâs his brain telling him heâs worthless and that he may not know it but testing to see if I am like everyone else and to just give him support but I donât know of itâs working I feel like messaging one of mine and his friends that way she knows him aswel as I do but I donât know what to do he says he has to be alone with this please help  
Hi all,  October 2012 I saw a consultant psych and he told me a was showing symptoms of Bipolar but he didn't want to diagnose it right away.  He put me on Citalopram 30mg and Olanzapine 15mg.  Last month I stopped taking the Olanzapine because I was told I didn't need them by 'a voice'. So i stopped. I guess the delusions are coming back althouth the depression isn't there with it anymore.  I don't feel manic like I used to I just feel like I really don't need this drug ands occasionally I have suicidal thoughts because I can't cope with feeling torn and confused between whether or not I should take the meds.  I have an emergency appointment with the same consultant tomorrow about this and was wondering if anyone could give some insight as to how this works?  What if I keep refusing the drug?  Is this an 'episode' I'm having?   Thanks in advance.  Russell. 
Hi,  Recently dx with Bipolar at the insistence of my employer that I needed psychiatric help due to numerous crying episodes at work (full days) then extremely bubbly and flirty and doing extended hours, additional projects but making silly mistakes I would never normally do etc. I have x long history of what I had always assumed was depression and self harm but thanks to google I had already self dx myself before seeing the pdoc. Since christmas though my moods have got so much worse and swing into a rage I have known before, I scream and flail at the kids for well just being kids really and last night to my utter disgust I gouged three chunks out of my partners arm because he made me jump?!  I'm three weeks into depakote 250mg twice daily, do I need to give it longer or does it need increasing, what?! I need something, I have no NHS pdoc yet so I'm just in a void which I'd not helping 
I've been with my partner for 10 yrs. He is either very mardy,mostly for no apparent reason or he is very hyperactive but its very rare he actually seems normal? These moods can change several times a day or he can just be very mardy one day then hyper the next day. Sometimes he is really negative about everything and hates the world, and others he can be very confident.                     He doesnt sleep well at night,he stays awake untill the early hours. This makes him mardy when i get him up in the morning but once he is up he is full of energy n hyper again. He smokes cannabis which doesnt seem to have the normal effect on him.He has also had problems with cocaine the last few years but its mostly a weekend thing. I have been telling him to doctors for years with his symptoms but he always insisted he was fine or got angry. Anyway he finally went to the doctors today,but she didnt seem interested at all and just referred him to a drug worker. I used to think it was just symptoms from drugs but i am not so sure now and i think he needs more help??  Can anyone help me with this??   
Hey i have been diagnosed with bipolar, on thursday and im just looking for someone who has the same condition as me, and can help me.. 
My son has high functioning autism and Tourette's syndrome he has recently had a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder onset age 14 years,  he is under a mental health team attached to camhs and he is on 0.5 mg risperdone twice a day and lorazepam to be given 0.5 mg every 4 hours when his mood is up or he is agitated. He is entering a manic or hypo manic episode roughly every two or three weeks and has fairly stable mood in between apart from autistic behaviors. My question is does anyone know how to stop or limit these episodes as they are having a terrible impact on the whole family and his doctor thinks his current riisperdone dose is keeping him stable which I disagree with. Any advice would be much appreciated. 
Hi - I am trying to help my DFiL, who has been on a cocktail including lithium and piprazole for a couple of years now, following acute anxiety symptoms that saw him try to jump out of a moving car.  Completely let down by the community mental health services, he has had to refer to a private psychiatrist, or he would still be waiting now!!!  Although the medication controls his anxiety, he has become 'masked' almost parkinsonian, and lost his lovely sense of humour and no longer initates discussions.  He has been considering coming off his medication, and I seem to remember a Stephen Fry programme interviewing a GP who had suffered from bipolar and was successfully controlling her symptoms with diet and lifestyle - and had gone back to her safety critical work part time.  SO - has anybody tried this - was it successful?  did you use a book or website?  was it monitored by a GP or psychiatrist?  Looking forward to your responses.  Hopefully... 
Hi I was diagnosed with bipolar 10 years ago and am currently on 1600mg lithium 2500mg sodium valprate and until today 1000mg of seroquel. The medication I now take is quite high as I suffered a relapse and this is the levels reached to stabilise me  I have been recently speaking to my doctor about how my weight gain is starting to depress me and have a detrimental affect on my mental and physical health,  we have decided to start weaning me off the seroquel and to start to introduce 10mg of aripiprazole ss apparently this is not associated with weight gain.  What I wanted to know is this medication change likely to help needed shift some of the weight as I know the other meds also contribute to the weight and also is there other alternatives totge other mood stabilisers I take that are also not associated to weight gain or even better cause weight loss  Thank you 
I'm a loving and caring family man, I have an older child and two little ones-I would like to save a marriage and a family from being apart. I'd like to understand more about Bipolar, as someone very close to me may have it. I hate leaving my kids and living apart, but hoping its for the best in the long run.  We were married 2 years ago. She lost her mum 4 or 5 months before we were married to cancer! We were married a few months and she decided she wanted a break. We seperated We have both had another partner or two We have got back together And split again She has recently said she thinks she may have Bipolar   What can I do???????? 
I think I'm bipolar and really think the only way to move forward with my life is to enter some sort of rehab away from home. Can anyone give me some advice pls as I don't even know where to start. 
My daughter was diagnosed with bipolar December 2013 and has been on 800mg lithium since beginning of December, she had other medication changed but stayed on lithium and now wondering if it is the lithium that is making her feel fed up every day and lifeless, any views on this would be appreciated. Her CPN said if she came off it she would be very ill again. 
I just want to go out clubbing and live like a teenager again! I went out last weekend and promised my husband and daughter I wouldn't drink but came home At 4 in the morning stinking drunk ! When I was out i was talking to loads of strangers with loads of confidence . I was on a bipolar high and drunk! I have promised my husband I won't go out again and am trying to enjoy family life but the temptation is always there to go and get wrecked and put myself in danger ! If there is anyone out there who feels the same and also suffers with this condition let me know . 
My daughter was diagnosed with bipolar in dec 2013 after going through a manic episode, during this episode she had great trouble with her speech, not being able to get words out and can only describe as locked jaw, this was all prior to any medication and being hospitalised. To this date she is still having trouble talking, can any one relate to this? 
it is a proven fact that among those with Bipolar, the median IQ is higher than that of the normie population..... it has nothing to do with perspective or mood. Your IQ is a measure of how well your brain works.... it has nothing to do with how much education you have or how creative you are (though it is also a known fact that there are a higher percentage of creative people among Bipolar also).... IQ simply measures how well your brain assimilates information. It is thought that a brain that has a higher capacity for manipulating information also has a higher chance of "breaking down"..... kinda like a porsche.... it is a fine tuned highly efficient machine but it will break down more often than grandma's buick 
I have been diagnosed with bi polar for 8 years, medication is helping, but my spending is out off  control, In 3 months I have clocked up £14000,00, that's not including the £20000.00 I owe my  husband and nearly £40000.00 I owe my dad, yes iv been very lucky having people to bail me out,  but this time I have no one to bail me out. Is there any thing I can do to help myself from spending all this money on crap I don't need just to make me feel better, Please help very desperate my  marriage is going to finish If I dont sort this out.  Many thanks 
Hi there, I have only recently been diagnosed with Bi-Polar. The "meds" that I am on are; Depekote - 2000mg; Olanzapine - 15mg; Sertaline - 200mg.  Since quite a young age, I rebelled against authority. This includes my parents, teachers, police...anybody who tried to tell me what to do really. I don't have many friends, and the friends that I do have are classed as 'normal' (so I say), therefore, they enjoy drinking, going to night clubs etc etc, but for obvious reasons I can't do this, and to be honest I don't want to be doing those things. I'm only 24 years old, but I feel like I have lived the life of a 45 year old. As I sit here writing this, I'm confused as to what to say, in my opinion, there's not enough support out there for people with Bi-Polar. I'm from Birmingham and there is very little available in the wayof any kind of support. I would love to start my own support group, just somewhere where you can go to have a tea/coffee and a chat and let off some steam to like-minded individuals. So I am going to end this post by asking if there are any other Brummies out there who would like to start something fresh for people with Bi-Polar, then please get in touch. Thank you for your time. 
My 26 yr old daughter was diagnosed with bipolar in dec 2013 and was hospitalised for 5 and a half weeks since discharge she has been very flat, emotionless and numb, she is on lithium and was on risperidone but has just come off the latter due to feeling lifeless and may try quetiapine, any views on this please? 
Hello there,  Really sorry in advance about the length of this post! Just wondering what kind of experience other people with bipolar disorder have after taking sertraline? i have a bipolar disorder, which was diagnosed 6 years ago after a suicide attempt. I have had both manic and depressive episodes my whole life (mainly manic up until the age of 18, then mostly depressive since then).  after i went to see my GP about the above-mentioned suicide attempt 6 years ago, she thought i was just depressed and, in panic that i might kill myself, prescribed me anti-depressants like citalopram and prozac (fluoxetine). she then referred me to professionals in mental health to diagnose me. whilst i was waiting for that to happen, i was taking first fluoxetine and later citalopram- anti-depressants which made me totally manic from the moment i started taking them (my pupils dilated, i couldn't speak or make sense of anything in my head, couldn't sit still or sleep or focus on anything). it reminded me very much of how i used to feel when i experienced my manic episodes before taking any medication at all.  That really freaked me out, but thankfully i was then seen by a number of doctors and i was diagnosed with bipolar (based on my HISTORY rather than the mania i was experiencing whilst on anti-depressants). i was then put on lamotrigine which is a mood stabiliser, commonly used to treat manic depression (bipolar). As it turns out, anti-depressants alone can dangerous when given to people suffering from bipolar as they can send you into a constant manic state (they are capable of doing so to depressive people without manic episodes, too).  After being on lamotrigine for 6 years, it has indeed improved my manic state, but has done very little to my depressive side. So, after my recent suicide attempt i have now been prescribed Sertraline in addition to my mood stabilisers.  as it turns out, it is often prescribed as a combination of drugs for bipolar people (no idea why they didn't prescribe them both 6 years ago!).  However, after taking it for the past 4 days, it has sent me into something similar to a manic episode i used to experience before being diagnosed. it is, however, not as strong as it was when i took citalopram and fluoxetine- and the doctor assured me that it was a medication of less adverse effects than the above. i searched on the net that sertraline can cause Akathisia in non-bipolar patients (inner restlessness and inability to sit still), which i think is very much what i am experiencing right now, although for me it reminds me more of my manic episodes. apparently, it is meant to go away after "several days". but i am seriously worried that this feeling will not go away. my other symptoms since taking sertraline have been: insomnia, obsessive thoughts, extremely vivid dreams about reality (making it impossible to distinguish whether it really happened or not!), having an "out of body" experience, spaced out, feeling like i don't care about anything, feeling like i don't want to do anything, feeling sleepy yet completely restless, feeling like i am about to faint, feeling sick, feeling like my heart will jump out of my chest any minute, upset stomach and SERIOUS trembles (especially of the hands). i guess i am just desperate to hear that there is someone out there who has experienced the same thing and whether these horrible adverse effects did indeed go away after a few days. because it ain't going anywhere in my case and it's really freaking me out. i am not sure what i would prefer- being suicidal as i was before i started taking it, or being restless and incapable of doing anything as i am now.  Very sorry about the length of this post, and thank you for taking time to read it. I really hope i can have your thoughts on this! Many thanks. 
hi everyone i just wanted to say my wife has bipolar and (b.p.d )boarderline personality disorder and i wouldn't change her for the world !!!!

I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2 a few months ago after I started rapid cycling - scary stuff. For years I was told it was stress, clinical depression... though I did get antidepressants.  I feel that with all the time off I am slowly committing professional suicide.I have now started a mood stabiliser as well as the antidepressants , but some problems getting settled on right doses -  some weird side effects. Work are now keeping a log of when I'm in - bit freaked that they will dump me. I work with special needs kids and I know I do a good job when I'm OK - not just my opinion but feedback from others, but I need to be there consistently. Bit of a ramble , new to all of this but help please - what are people's experiences? 
I was hoping for advice and support from anyone living with a Bi polar sufferer?  I have had an emotional and roller coaster relationship with a man I fell deeply in love with, thinking I could 'overcome' and 'understand' his bi polar.  When it was good it was excellent but his episodes of depression aggression and self belief that he was worthless were killing what we had.  I had to end it with him, my children and I were getting increasingly stressed with him and I wonder to this day if there would ever have been a happy ending. 
I was diagnosed on Thursday after being assessed and have been referred to the stage 2 mental health team as a priority due to suicidal tendencies, following a concerted attempt at taking my life on the Sunday previous. I was assured someone from the mental health unit would be contacting me with a view to putting emergency measures in place. Unfortunately this hasnt happened and being in the bottom of a low totally unmedicated and living alone is quickly become a nightmare even with the support of my friends via facebook. When i was diagnosed i was asked if anyone else withinin my family was treated for depressive states , i have found out unbeknown to myself that 3 of my siblings suffered from depression at one point or another and my sister pointed out that the indications of myself having this were apparent at 13 years old , i am gonna be 46 in April , i have kept this nightmare within myself for 32 years with no medication , support or anything , but stresses over the last two years and last few months in particular led to a major episode last week and is continuing to deepen. It has cost me my relationship of ten months and i am now at my wits end because the promised support hasn't materialised , the fact that i live alone is making the situation even more desperate , i need help now , not in a couple of weeks time , that may be too late 
Hi all.  I've recently been diagnosed with Bipolar I and after a few medication changes and three hospitalisations have been put on venlafaxine 225mg, aripiprazole 30mg, lorazepam 1 mg 4x daily, and zopiclone at night.  Does anyone else have experience with any of these medications? 
do all anti deppressants cause a manic episode or are some more likely to cause one than others? I only ask coz my partner went on a really crazy high after accidentally was given a huge anti deppressant dose while in a psych ward but didn't with her current anti depressant 
I take venlafaxine and quetiapine for the treatment of bipolar. I'm finding that some side effects have gone now after 4 months and I'm working on dealing with the side effects that haven't. Does anyone with bipolar have an anti depressant and mood stabiliser combination that works well for them? Also does anyone receive any health support in the form of sport, like swimming maybe? 
Hi there,  Just thought I'd share my story with Bipolar Disorder.  I'm 24 years old and was diagnosed 3 years ago this December coming, have been on lithium 3 years ago this January and it's done wonders... for the mania anyway.  If depression takes hold, I'm prescribed Seroquel but don't like it much as it knocks me out.    Anyway, I'd struggled with ups and downs throughout my teens, my parents just put it down to me being a difficult teenager.  Finally ended up being diagnosed with rapid cylcing bipolar disorder, OCD and Borderline Personality Disorder traits (not sure what that means...).  Totally didn't believe them at the time because I was manic and hallucinating!! It took a while to find the right dose of lithium and I'm finally settled on 800mg and it's working pretty OK; doesn't really help with the depression, but I can see that it won't be this way forever and it'll be over in a week or so.  It HAS definitely helped with mania/hypomania, don't get the hyperness or impulsiveness anymore, but I get REALLY irritable for days/weeks instead.  I've also found that exercise has really helped me; since the start of this year I've really thrown myself into Combat, Pump, Zumba and Balance classes.  My moods swings have gotten better ten-fold, I have more energy and a more positive outlook - albeit not all the time, but I don't wanna be a zombie now hehe.  I feel really, really lucky I had a quick diagnosis (from my GP first noticing it wasn't \&quot;just depression\&quot; to being referred to Insight and being treated by a psychiatrist and diagnosed, about 6 months), I've an amazing set of friends which thanks to them I've never needed hospitalising.  A very understanding family, when really they've never known me any different and a boyfriend who accepts me and my mood-swinging nueroticness and still loves me! Haha.   Anyway, I know it's not often a \&quot;positive\&quot; bipolar story is heard.  But I feel really lucky and wanted to share .  Lala. X 
I'm on aripiprazole and dosulopin to treat bipolar after tries of other combinations. The dosulopin isn't helping so I'm hoping to try clomiprimine, I was on it over 15 years ago for depression and anxiety but don't remember what I thought of it so long ago. Does anyone have their experience of it to share? 
In my experience, I had symptoms of bipolar for years but only after a manic episode and I was hospitalized did I get diagnosed with this disorder.    Melissa Miles McCarter 
hello, i am new to this and i have been diagnosed bipolar since April 2010, i had a baby in sept 2008 and they were treating me for post-natal depression but i have always been up there in the clouds, and always very angry, and i just cannot accept this.  I have 3 kids and a husband that i am awful to and i have only seen a shrink on one occassion, they keep messing my appointments around, i took an overdose 3 weeks ago because i got so confused, i feel down every day and some days i get a mixture of exitement and low moods, this has been with me for 2 months now and never a day i get up that i dont feel angry.  I was prescribed haloperidol 5mg and these were like tranquilizers and i dont recall 2 weeks ago, then they dropped it to 1.5mg and now i dont know what to think. the doctors passes me to the shrink, the shrink passes me to the doctor.

hello, to everyone bipolar or not you must be here for a reason. i was diagnosed 10 yrs ago with bi-polar disorder and have been on lithium ever since . has anyone else been on lithium for ages but feel they dont feel much at all now today i was walking back from the corner shop some kids playing, few cars about but i felt as though i was looking in not there myself at all. i draw and paint but only when my head lets me and when i do i ask myself what is the point of doing this then i cant seem to take joy from anything and i also think whats the point of living i am 52 now but in my mind i just think you will be dead soon everything you have learnt everything you can do gone.          what a f..'@;g waste. 
I was prescribed Semisodium Vaproate slow release tablets after the birth of my child for Cyclothymia, a condition related to Bi Polar disorder.    I initially found it useful in stabilising my moods but am now wondering how much of my improved health is due to life and priority changes, and how much is due to the medication. I also wonder if my Psychiatrist was so determined that it would help me, that I believed it would, and so my health improved.    I find I miss the side of me that is more creative, expressive and eccentric, but the obsessive thoughts I used to suffer with are very much quietened and that I feel much less paranoid as well.  My Psychiatrist says it would be a gamble for me to come off the tablets and that we should both consider it carefully.   The unwanted effects of the drug that I have experienced have been bleeding gums, digestive problems (I'm either constipated or have diahorroea, usually the latter), and I had fairly bad acne on my back for a few months when I first started taking it, and less bad on my face, though worse than is normal for me. The tablets are also very large and hard to swallow and then can get stuck or give me indigestion for a while. 
I've been on Lamotrigine for a couple of months now for Bipolar and I'm feeling very little difference. I'm only on 100mg a day but I don't feel anything has changed since I started, has anyone else experienced this? I've heard so many wonderful things about this drug and everyone seems so positive about their experiences, is it just me?
