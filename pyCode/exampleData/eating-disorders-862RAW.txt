Every time I see food on the stove or in the lunch line I don't feel like I can eat it because it just doesn't look appealing. A family member insisted that I eat some Chinese food they bought last night and I made a bowl and I couldn't eat all of it and I didn't even get a lot of it. I tried to eat more of it but it made me really uncomfortable and I got really upset over it so I stopped and put it in the fridge. Before last night I hadn't eaten anything 3 days prior. I'm not sure why I don't seem to be able to enjoy food even when I know I need it. 
Hey I'm new to these forums , I just have a question I thought it would be good to ask outright instead of obsessing over online tests like I have been.  I'm a 13 year old girl in australia. My whole life I've always been "petite" I guess, but lately I think Its getting more noticeable, at least to me. I'm 36.5 kg and 159 cm (I'm pretty sure it's around 80.4lbs and 5"1 but you might want to check that) and recently a couple of people commented on the fact that I was skinny, so I did research and apparently my BMI is like 14.7, which is pretty severely underweight.   It is true that i often skip breakfast and lunch and sometimes only eat every few days, but I don't think I have an eating disorder because I don't have the mindset I've read about where you constantly think about calories and exercise. I would like to be a little thinner but I don't really care to be honest.   One other thing is I constantly have this thing where I wish I could be hurt or have a disorder or a mental issue or something but I don't know why. Maybe to give me a good reason to be sad when I am. I really don't know.   I'm probably just overreacting? As I do. But I would appreciate it if someone could help me on this.  Sorry if this is offensive to anyone for any reason I don't mean it to be I'm just trying to say how I feel.   Thanks  -AndPeggy

I've suffered from bullemia for about five years. I've tried to stop and can usually do it for about a month, but then end up slipping back into my bad habits. I binged then threw up this afternoon but have decided that it is the last time. I am going to get my life back on track and become a healthier and happier me!  I have never told any of my family or friends this, so will be using this forum as support. I am so determined to recover.  
Hi  I hope you're all well. Anyway, here's my ramble:  I can't stop binge eating. I want to stop but I don't know how.  I started to binge last year, in around September, when I started university. I'd binge eat (on biscuits, chocolate, cereal, etc) at an almost daily basis. I wouldn't stop - even when I felt sick from eating so much - until the whole packet was finished. I don't really know why I did it. I suppose it was partly because eating was a way of distracting myself from thinking bad thoughts, and partly because I didn't like leaving packets of food unfinished - I had (and still do have) this 'all or nothing' frame of mind. I felt disgusted with myself after every binge.  About two months later I bought myself some bathroom scales. I then became obsessed with weighing myself. Despite having a weight in the 'normal' BMI range, I felt so fat and unhealthy - and I knew that I'd put on even more weight if I continued to binge eat all the time. And so I tried hard to restrict my intake whenever I can.  However, these restricting days didn't happen often enough for me. I wanted to lose a lot of weight - and my intake to be low for each and every day. But it's so hard to stop the binge-eating.   This leads me to where I am now. I've recently begun to make myself sick after every binge (which happens most days) because I don't want to put on weight. The muscles around my stomach are hurting.   And at this moment in time, I feel like my eating habits are out of control. I feel like I'm stuck in this binge-purge cycle. I'm scared of putting on weight. I've had a panic attack over how high my BMI is. All I see on my body is a disgusting amount of fat.  In the past, I didn't care so much about my appearance - but now I feel as though the whole world is judging and shaming me on how fat and ugly I look.   I really hate my own mind. And I don't really know what to do with myself. I've told no-one in real life about these eating behaviours.  So yeah. Thank you so much for taking time to read this (very long) message. I really appreciate it.  (P.S. If it's of any use, my height is ~161cm and my current weight is ~122lbs. My BMI works out to be ~21.3 - and that's way too high for my liking. I want to weigh much less - and even be underweight...)

I just found this support group tonight and am really hoping there are active mommies or mommies to be on here.   I have had an ED since around 12 yo. I suffered from anorexia, body dysmorphia and binge eating, and learned to be bulimic (purging) when my youngest was around a year old, in 2009. I've struggled with it and had weight fluctuations between 118-148 pounds, I'm 5'8" so it's a huge variance for me.   I'm 3 months pregnant with my third, facing an extremely stressful period without my fiancé and am seriously suffering with bulimia at the moment. I start my day ok with some fruity kefir to take my prenatal vitamins, then the day goes downhill from there. Today I had a large meal for lunch and purged, then ate three donuts, ate a late dinner and purged, then ate 3 more donuts. I know this is extremely unhealthy for myself and my baby and really hope to find some support online to strengthen and cope with this. If there are any other mom's out there who have been through this or currently are, please reach out so we can get some support for each other!    â¤ï¸ 
Begining with a brief history. I'm nearly 33 I've had some form of eating disorder since I was 11. I've never been diagnoised, but I have diagnoised myself with EDNOS.  At the age of 11 I began to abuse laxatives. For the most part until I was 18 this was mostly what I did to "purge".  At 18 I became anorexic. Then I started learning about purging soon after (still 18) I became pregnant the at 19 and still abused myself just a little less, but I miscarried. My now exhusband was very abusive emotionally and physically. After my miscarriage my eating disorder hit my rock bottom. By the time I was 20 I was at my lightest weight of 92 pounds (I'm 5'3" I ran 2 miles a day I walked all day I starved myself and if I ate anything g even if it was a strawberry I purged. And took laxatives. I lived on 4 blow pops, and 2 packs of fruit flavored mentos, and unlimited coffee and diet coke for a long time. I also took about 15 dexatrim diet pills a day, i had devloped a tolerance to them and this is when dexatrim used to have ephedra in them. One night I felt (I really believed I was) like I was dying. I got up and ate 1/2 a sandwich.  To keep myself alive I began to eat 2 pieces of bread at night (11 or later) I developed a condition known as night eating syndrome which to this day I still struggle with.  Then when I turned 21 I was going through divorce and began to drink a bit and gained a bunch of weight. My weight climbed to 135, then it fluctuated from 103 to 120 for a while. I got pregnant was determined to take care of my growing baby and gave birth to a healthy baby. Dropped back down fluctuation to 103-115 all the while continuing to abuse laxatives. I had another baby 3 years ago then i had my tubes tied and lost all my baby weight was at 109 july 2014 then I was raped. At first my weight dropped to 103 then it began to climb.... and climb... until here I am at 130. And no matter what I do I can't lose any of the weight. I work out an hour a day I limit food. And my weight will not budge. It's a struggle to even maintain the 130. It seems ever couple of months out of no where I gain 3-4 pounds around my period and it won't come back off. I know I'm holding at least 15 pounds of water weight.....   In a nut shell I've Abused laxatives (I was at 6 a day) (I've stopped and haven't had much change in my ability to "go", in fact for a few days I was going just as often. But then I began trying a "better for you laxative" milk of magnesia. An attempt to ease my way off stimulant laxatives.  I've Abused diet pills, I've abuse many pills in general, I'm still purging from time to time, I'm being to be afraid to eat because everything I eat makes me insanely bloated and gassy (I attempted raw low fat vegan and fruitarian) bloat and gas and no change in my weight. I haven't had more than 800 cals (a day) in the last 4 days and my weight won't budge.  So my question is what are the potential problems (health wise) someone like myself after abusing there body over the years so that now they can't control their weight at all? I've been trying to lose weight since I began putting the weight on 1 1/2 years ago... I know I'm not consuming many calories I know I'm moderately active so what gives? I have an appointment with my doctor in 2 days but she hasn't been able to help me with a diagnoisis yet, I think my issue is beyond her, I'm trying to think of who I can request a referral to go see. A GI tract specialist is all I can think of, but I'm so desperate to get a handle on this problem and I can't seem to. There has to be some medical reason as to why I can't lose weight anymore, because I am doing the working out and practically starving thing and nothing is working.  Someone please point me in the right direction 
So I had to go to the doctors for something unrelated to my ED, upon the visit my height and weight was took which is where my doctor grew concerned.  My BMI is low enough to be admitted in to a clinic, so she pressed for answers.. I followed suit and the more in depth it got the more concerned she grew.  Now she's put in for an emergency referral to the ED clinic. I'm not mentally prepared or ready for this.. I can feel my anxiety kick starting, even though I know I need help I'm not ready to accept it yet.  Has anyone else experienced this and what can I do? 
I have recntly been discharged from an eating disorder unit and was not given a plan to follow. i am really struggling with this and was wodenring if any one has an example i could follow? 
Hi. I've noticed that when I have a treat at night or something that wasn't scheduled on my meal plan. .I lay awake worrying about it. Does anyone have any tips to help me relax more as I'm not sleeping well which makes everything worse.  I had 2 jammy dodgers last night and because id already had a yoghurt before hand i beat myself up about it and didn't sleep well. What makes it worse that I'm on training today so can't exercise to make up for it. Any advise be much appreciated. .I'm on sleeping tablets atm to until my weight improves.      
I'm 24 and since I can remember I have had some sort of food phobia. I can only eat the food I ate when I was 4 years old and I'm terrified to try anything different. Even when I want too (like chicken for example) when I get the fork near my mouth I go into a panic. My parents took me to the doctors when I was younger but they said it's a phase and I will grow out of it. Then when I was 18 I went again and they just told me what food groups I'm missing in my diet, not helpful, and when I explained that I want help for it they told me I'm not unhealthy as I can eat potato, veg and fruit so wouldn't do anything. I thought my body had adapted to my carb filled diet but as I grow older I feel tired all the time, I have to set an alarm to get up in the morning or I will sleep past lunch without waking, and in the winter I am forever getting ill. I have been ill 3 times in 2 weeks with sickness and diarrhoea. It panics me because I am married and in the next few years would like to have children but I don't think my body or either the babies will survive. What should I do? Should I try my doctors again? 
When I was 12 I had been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and at the time EDNOS (I'm not familiar with the new term.) I had developed cysts in my liver and sludge in my gall bladder. It was when I was 15 that I could say I had 'recovered', I still felt guilty and worried sometimes though. I was never very underweight for my height, I lost 10kgs (22lbs) over the time I was suffering. But between my 15th and just after my 17th I gained 20kgs (44lbs). I was still in a (generally) healthy range. I weighed 67kgs (147.7lbs) and I'm 5'1. My weight was high, but it wasn't my body fat, it was more a healthy balanced ratio of muscle and fat. Not to mention my chest isn't exactly normal (I'm a size 8H, so that takes up surprisingly a lot of weight). I'm now 17, about 5-6 weeks ago I started feeling a bit of that guilt come back. Just in the past 6 days I've lost 8kgs (17.6lbs). This is 3 inches off my waist. It's actually made me feel horribly run down, physically and mentally. I honestly didn't think it was possible to lose weight that fast.. And I haven't been exercising at all, until today.  I spoke a few weeks ago to my doctor about how I feel but I'm so mixed up about whether I tell her I've actually been fasting for 24 hours at a time and I'm only breaking it with a sandwich.  I've been drinking twice the amount of coffee I usually do to keep my stomach occupied. I'm partially lactose intolerant so the milk in the coffee kind of speeds my body's digestive system along a bit. And I haven't had water for the 6 days, I don't know why I'm so scared to put on water weight, I know it has no calories and it can be shed off easily. I'm still drinking the coffee though, my logic has just gone off the Earth.  My boyfriend (of 3 years) even commented when I was at his house, 'why can I see you ribs, I shouldn't be able to see them.' (Not in some kind of controlling way, more a concerned way.) And since that day I've already lost 2kgs (4.4lbs). I know the kind of strain this will put on my relationship if I continue this and I'd never in a million years forgive myself if I did cause any strain. 6 days ago I weighed 67kgs (147.7lbs) and right now I weigh 59kgs (130lbs). I know I'm in healthy range, but if the same weight loss pattern continues, by the end of next week I could be around 50-55kg (110-121lbs). I always weigh myself first thing in the morning.   I'm not sure about what to do. I don't want to go through seeing a psychologist again because it just causes more stress than good. But I have bigger priorities in my life now than when I was 12. (Relationship, work, final year of school). I'm just stuck and I think I just need to read advice from a stranger's perspective to help ground me. I really do welcome anyone's advice.  I apologise for a long post. It's just I know I'm being irrational about food, but I can't stop. 
Im scared I'm going to become Bulimic. Quite recently , Whenever I've eaten a big meal or some unhealthy food, I've thought bout eating more until I feel sick and so then I can go and make myself sick it back up. Earlier today, I ate a lot of chcolate and as I lay down I felt as if I could feel all the sugar turning into fat and adding onto my already fat stomach. It made me feel so disgusted that I actually went to the bathroom and knelt in front of the toilet and tried to push it back up. I stopped myself and walked away but I'm scared that it's going to get worse. 
HI I am currently in the process of recoverey and after looking at some of the recent posts I thought I would ask if anyone was intrested in befriending with me through our journey. The most importanrt thing I have learnt is that support is the best tool in getting to where ou want to be, even more so with someone who can relate what your going through. I can be just by email or skype..but even if someone was in my area Id love to meet regularly for coffee as again it really benifist to meeet with people. I have loads of questions I want toa sk but alos alot of answers and reassurance to give back to soemone whio needs it. I just want a friend really!!! Message here if intrested. Im on facbook also. xx    
It's almost 2017 and I don't want to feel this way anymore I want to be able to eat and not feel guilty or not worry about my weight and wear clothes to hide it. Is it Still an eating disorder because my mind tells me it isn't it was bad before I went to 98 pounds but tried to eat normal so I messed my motasliaum up badly and put weight on to 118 so I don't even look unwell to be taken seriously anymore. I restrict and start a diet every week, I can sometimes eat what i want if I'm feeling happy or been with people who eat normal and I want to be normal but it never sticks I'm always going back to restricting the next day and trying not to eat but I do under 500 cals and now and again going into purging. I have been taking diet pills even f I eat normal I feel guilty and take them whatever I can get my hands on. If I try to eat my mind just keeps repeating a skinny girl I wanna look like and photos I look fat so that puts me off so badly I can't live my life like . my reflection everything my chubby face and stretch marks on my thighs are a constant painful reminder I can't stand my self !! I hate having my picture taken and that's what I'm freakig out about at Christmas all the photos I looked fat last year from bloating from gaining the weight back I dont want to look like that this year!! 
I am obssesed with weighing myself and I dont like to eat however my family make me, as I am still living at home. However, if I dont eat my family will make me get help and I really dont want that. I am 160cm and between 63-64 kilos changing on a daily basis. I have a growing fear of gaining weight. However, I often binge eat and then feel really fat and don't know what to do with myself; PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME! 
I'm not sure when I became anorexic but my dieting began in April of 2015 and got more and more restrictive throughout the following months until every day i was only having about 400-700 cals and was literally terrified of eating anything that wasn't an apple or lettuce.  When I lost close to 40 lbs by december without any excercise, my parents intervened and told me i wouldn't be allowed to go to college in the fall (this coming fall in a month ish!!!) unless i "got back to normal" i was devastated and a horrible mess bc i was hardly underweight and i still think its the best i've ever looked. Anyway, they made me gradually start to eat again and see therapists beginning in January and by May i went from like 100 to 105 lbs however i was still incredibly scared to eat and was highly restrictive with food. At this point i used water loading and food weight to convince them i was 112 lbs.  In the 1st week of june my mom told me she was going to weigh me, and i knew it would look like i lost 7 lbs and she'd flip. I panicked and ate a TON of food (mostly apple oatmeal and ice cream) to put on food weight by bloating up. But for like another 5 days after i initially let go of control and truly ate past all restrictions, i began binging on and off all throughout june and july the 5 lbs of food weight never went back down and since then ive fluctuated between 110 and 113 (usually closer to 110 or 111 though.  Since that first week the binges have become less in quantity (usually between 2-3000 cals total at the end of the day) and less frequent, but I am FREAKING OUT. I've never had this problem before recovery and all the sudden when i try to restrict I might make it a few days and then the next day I become ravenously hungry and it just doesnt stop until I cave and eat a TON of food. I feel like a fat disgusting failure for getting this out of control and I honestly don't know what to do. I've tried fasting and i can go quite a while but as soon as I begin eating again i go nuts. I hate myself beyond words and I don't know what to do.  Am I a binge eater??????! I NEED to lose this weight I look disgusting, but nothing works. I've tried doing 1200 cals but i'll end up eating like 1500-2000 instead. But if I aim for 800 i'll end up eating 500 for a day or so before I snap out of it. I feel like i've been bouncing in between two mentalities and now all i can do is cry.  please help me!!!! if i do have BED what do i do??? i know its sick but i miss the fear it made life so simple  (ps. im so sorry its so long i ended up ranting) 
My husband has been receiving harrassing and malicious phone calls lately theyre pretending to be his girlfriend and saying theyre going to marry him. When i said to stop calling from a witheld number they said shut it Fatty. Ive battled with anorexia and bulimia for 10 years. I started to get better then developed RI so my mobility hasnt been great so i know i have put on weight. But now that this person whom i dont even know has confirmed it all i want to do is make my self sick or not eat at all. We told them we recorded the phone calls so the calls have stopped now they just ring and hang up.But today they are messing with our business page on facebook suggesting edits to the page. They suggested changing the link to our website and when we clicked on the link it took us to an article that said body of man found in house and suggested we change the location of our business to our actual home address. Help!  
Hi there I really need some advise in some coping skills when I can't stick to my meal plan or feel the need to weigh myself or exercise excessively.  I gave been in recovery for over 8 years and I'm eating well but still underweight through my active lifestyle and my "safe choices"  i need to gain weight so I can become healthy to have a baby which is what me and my husband are in the process of trying for. Though this in itself has not been easy. We are both having tests as it's been difficult for me.to fall pregnant,  so I feel like a complete failure.  I know I need to gain weight so my meal plan is now aimed at high calorie food with extra fat protein and carb. Every meal is so scary though. I don't know how to cope aftwr I've eaten it other than burn it all of. I message my husband for reassurance but he is so busy with work I feel awful that this is a full time job for him aswell I really need some advise or someone to talk to who knows how I feel at times when I feel he need to skip meals, snacks or exercise  Please help.  Xxxx  
I'm currently seeing a dietitian fortnightly, and today was a weigh day. My weight had shot up 2kg and I have really freaked out.  My dietitian wasn't clear what it could be when we analysed my intake - although she suspects some bloating potentially as it wouldn't be possible to gain that much weight in this period of time. It's not my time of the month either, when I know I get bloating (I have a week to go till this).  I just wondered if anyone else had experienced anything similar in anorexia recovery.

I was recently in a eating disorder unit but since i have come out i have had a relapse and lost some weight. i am scared to put it back on and am unsure of how much i should be eating to gain and then how much to maintain. can anyone help please? 
 hello. i am 170cm and weigh 70kg. how much will i loose if i do not eat for 3 days and burn 600 cal a day? thanks  
This past few days I've been taking an awful lot of dulcolax. Today I am feeling totally ill. How can I avoid feeling like this. I have four young children at home and am not coping too well 
Hello all,  I am 27 and have suffered with an eating disorder since the age of 11. So a very long time. During this time I have been hospitalised 3 times, have suffered with a long absence with my period, osteopenia, heart arrythmias and so on.  The last couple of years have been an amazing journey, where I have been fortunate to work with two excellent dietitians and a fantastic therapist. Today I had a review with my current dietitian as to how things were going, as we have now been meeting for a while. Around a month and a half ago, I hit my target weight band, and have continued to maintain since then.  I am learning to deal with being this weight (a common weight band is aroun 2kg) and coming to terms with my body. I have had to buy new clothes over the last year, and throw out the old ones, and because of this, I treated myself to lots of new stuff. This is helping me feel positive about myself.  Over the last two years, I have come from living off liquid, to introducing meals and snacks across the day, and meals with carbs. Although I calorie count, this helps me stay in control and manage to push myself. I have never felt so in control in my life. I feel so much less stressed and able to make decisions. I catasrophise less now too.  I have met with my entire treatment team over the past couple of weeks and they have all confidently said how proud of me they are and how well I am doing.  I am not recovered, I still have some way to go, but I will recover. I am no longer suffering with anorexia nervosa, but am in recovery.  I wanted to write this, as I know there are a lot of people here in a lot of pain, and you can do it.  
Hi all. Really need some advise on how I can come over the one hurdle that's holding me back. I've been in recovery for 3 years now and I'm still really unhappy. I'm underweight but can't seem to get over the fact I feel.so bloated and uncomfortable.  I punish myself for not getting food out so when im constipated I punish myself through exercise.  I've been to the doctors back and forth over the years but they don't seem concerned that I could go weeks with out proper bowl movements and just suggest osmotic laxatives. It's constantly on my mind 24/7 and I can't continue to live like this.   This is definetly the one thing that's preventing me  from living a for filling life and my husband probably hates hearing me moan about it.  I spend so much time sat on the loo hoping for something to happen.  Constipation Sucks and I fear I will be like this forever. And I've tried every remedy going...apart from weight gain. Please help!!! Xx  
Im 16, female, ive recently been diagnosed with an eating disorder, i weigh 5st 9 and am 5ft 4. I know im skinny, always have been, but i dont see it that way uness im stood next to someone who i see as slim and realise im way smaller than them. I dont let myself eat as much as i dont want to gain weight, on paper i do but physically i feel i want to lose weight, i look at my legs and think they are chunky even though in the back of my mind i know that they really arent. I feel like im having a constant fight in my head whether i should eat to be healthy but then fighting the urges not to eat as atm they are the stronger thoughts. I am sared of making myself ill but i finally feel this gives me control over my life, i lost my dog and grandad very recently and suddenly and hate the fact i have no control ove any of it. However this is do, if ive been good and not eaten alot in the day ill eat a bit later on, i eat enough to keep myself going but no way near enough to put on the weight im being told i should put on. I feel sick after and before i eat which also reduces how much i eat. I dont look at myself as beautiful at all and have always been rather shy and lacking in self confidence which is also what i believe may have stimulated these issues. Any advice on how i can change the way i think about myself? 
Back when I was 15 I became bulimic for about 5 years until I turned 20. I've been in recovery for 10 months now and eating very healthy lots of protein and fats. The thing is because of the bulimia I've lost 50-60% of my hair. I was told as soon as I recover my hair will grow back. It's been 10 months and there's barely any improvement at all. Has anyone else had experience with hair loss because of bulimia? If so, will my hair ever grow back to how it was before? I really miss my thick long hair  how long will it take for my hair to fully recover? Its already been 10 months and its not getting much thicker  plz help 
I've been purging quite frequently over the past year or so, I don't eat a lot before I do it just regular meals and so I don't think I have bulimia or anything like that. I know what I am doing is wrong but I can't help it I just hate the feeling after I've eaten and I guess making myself purge almost makes me feel as though I am in control ?? The problem is I've been starting to get heart palpitations and light headed even when I'm doing nothing. I don't know who to go to as i think my friend had an eating disorder in the past as she gets quite touchy whenever someone brings up the subject so I don't want to upset her, also I'm scared to tell my parents in case they blame themselves. I've read about what happens to your body after purging yet I still do it so I am scared someone please give me advice. Many thanks x 
Last year, my sister and I both ate very unhealthily. We both ate a ton of junk food and loads of fat. I was ok because my body has a fast metabolism and I gained weight (quite a lot) but I was still skinny. My sister on the ither hand got a bit chubby. She had huge thighs and while she wasn't exactly obese she was pushubg it a bit. Around octobre 2015, my sister decided she wanted to lose weight. She went on a dietbut didn't tell anyone about it. She had just started at a new school and so she didn't come home for lunch anymore while my brother and I did. She always took lots of stuff to school but chucked it away. She didn't eat breakfast and for supper she often pretended she was ill or ate very slowly. Basically she was starving herself. I didn't notice for a long time and went ln pretty happy with myself. I was eating less junk food because I wanted to be healthy but I was eating well and looked good. Then, I went off on a camp for a week. When I came back, my sister was in hospital because she had lost so much weight. That really scared me. She spent a few days there. When she came back, she claimed she was over everything and that she was going to stop. But I watched her like a hawk and I nloticed she still ate nothing for breakfast and chucked away her lunch. I started dieting myself, although I didn'tneed to. At first it wasn't so bad but I became obsessed with it. There is so much competition between me and my sister, for school, friends, sport, everythkng. I was terrified she was going to be thinner than me and therefore more beautiful. I started eating nothing all day and doing loads of sport. In the evening I only ate exactly what my sister ate. I tracked how much exercise she did and tried to work out exactly how much she had been eating. I was addicted to eating less and exercisibg lore than her. I didn't even want to lose weight I just didn't want her to be better than me. I ended up in hospital for a week. Now I'm out again and I need to gain weight but I can't. I can't let go of the competing with my sister. I have to eat less than her. The problem is, at the moment my sister's weight is fine, but I am seriously underweight. I I don't gain weight by thursday, which is when I have to see the doctor, I might end up in hospital again, but I can't bring myself to eat! I see my sister eating nothing and cutting up her food really small and drinkkng lots so thst it looks like she's eating and she isn't, and I just refuse to eat myself. I know I need to but somehow I just can't. It's ruining my health and my happiness. The only thing I can think of is how many calories I have eaten vs how many calories she has eaten. How can I stop it?  
I don't know what to do. I've been an anxiety sufferer for many years now. I've tried all the meds and nothing has helped. This has led into another anxiety over the years about food and eating.   I've learned to eat a few things over and over again and they have constituted my "diet". Now I've been diagnosed with Celiac disease and the foods that I have been eating are no longer things I can eat! Because I'm not a skinny twig, any doctor I've talked to about my eating woes have just shrugged and told me to eat more.    They just don't get it! And now I'm so much more anxious especially about eating that I just don't want to eat anything! I've already lost 10 pounds in too short a time and I'm worried about what's going to happen to me...No one is listening and I feel that only if I collapse will someone finally help..but I don't want to collapse...and I don't want to eat! I'm stuck! 
I eat very little, I have been this way for years. I don't eat lunch, very small breakfast and dinner in the evening. Its been so long I now get stomach pains and diarrhea if I eat too much and I mean anything more than a first size is too much. Sometimes if I feel stomach pains coming on I will make myself sick to try and circumvent the pains and diraea. My wife says I have bulimia, I am not sure thats right. I am 5ft 10 and weigh 9 stone (126 pounds). I really hate my GP , the receptionist is really nasty so I avoid going there. Any ideas what it might be? 
Every time I see food on the stove or in the lunch line I don't feel like I can eat it because it just doesn't look appealing. A family member insisted that I eat some Chinese food they bought last night and I made a bowl and I couldn't eat all of it and I didn't even get a lot of it. I tried to eat more of it but it made me really uncomfortable and I got really upset over it so I stopped and put it in the fridge. Before last night I hadn't eaten anything 3 days prior. I'm not sure why I don't seem to be able to enjoy food even when I know I need it. 
Hi all,  Back when I was 19 (now 29) I ended up becoming bulimic and anorexic. I wouldn't of said I was hugly overweight as I was between a size 12/14.  Don't get me wrong when I managed to get down to 9.7stone I was the happiest and even when the doctors told me I was underweight it was so happy as I have never been that small in my life.   Growing up I used to weigh 16stone and remember when I was 13yrs trying on a size 18 pair of jeans and they were too small.   My family then saw my dramatic change and the look of guilt on my mums face of her blaming herself for me making myself sick and not eating anything as she wasn't nearby to stop me.   From then I stopped making myself sick and I started eating more. But I hated the idea of feeling full or bloated. So as a comprise to myself I started taking laxatives. This way no one could hear me being sick and I could say I had an upset stomach.   Over the years I have tried to ease myself off these and now I only take them 3 times a week or if I have an occasion I take them more.  I've mentioned this to a number of doctors and no one seems to want to help. I've heard so many times "Your looking healthy so i wouldn't worry"  But I am worried and I don't want any long term illnesses or even get bowel cancer. But this is the reaction I get from doctors because I look healthy.   I'm hitting the gym and I do have a healthy lifestyle but I just can't seem to shift the pounds so this is making me do them more.   I buy the boots own brand laxatives and when I do take them I have 8 tablets. But like now, after about an hour I got the cold sweats, shakes and I was sick.   Does this mean I've damaged my body? This isn't the first time this has happened   Thanks all Louise 
So about 3 months ago I started to eat less and less than I normally would, I would eat breakfast lunch and dinner with snacks in between, now I eat a small dinner with some snacks. I don't get as hungry as a used to but when I am hungry, my body feels like it is rejecting the fool. At times I get this sharp pain in my stomach that goes on for 30 minutes to an hour. I have been told that I am developing Anorexia but I'm not sure. I'm still very young, and I want help. Some days I don't eat at all, and one time I threw up out of nowhere, and it almost felt as if I could feel my stomach acid. I am very skinny I weigh about 96 pounds and I am 5'2.5. I visited a doctor for it once when my eating was better than it is now and they told me to keep an eating log but I never did and I haven't gone back. I just want to know what is wrong with my body and why this is happening. I have also started getting many panic attacks and my anxiety has gotten really bad over the past few months and I want to know if it ties in with me not eating. I don't purposely not eat, I just am not hungry. 
This is for my friend this is what she said "okay my stomach hurts really badly and if I try to eat my body just rejects it and when I do get hungry I'll only eat very little and I'll feel really full and sometimes I'll just be sitting here doing nothing and my stomach will get these sharp pains and like cramps for no reason and sometimes it literally feels like I can feel my stomach acid it's really weird" it's been going on for a while does anyone know what's wrong? She's pretty skinny and I'm worried 
I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for around four years now. I struggle with big life changes or large amounts of pressure e.g stress in employment or university.  Now I've managed to finish university I've found myself obsessing about my weight - before I became depressed I was 8st.  In the past four years, i'm now at my largest weight of nearly 13st and I feel awful, I'm fat, huge and I know its terrible for my health.  When I have a bad day, feel depressed, feel stressed, or just generally feel bad all I want to do is eat. But then I also obsess about everything I've eaten and I feel terrible and depressed and a failure for getting so fat.  I feel obsessed with food, it seems to be all I think about. I constantly feel bad for eating and sometimes want to make myself sick.  I can't stick to a diet because of my mental health. I don't know what to do its a constant bad cycle I'll never get out of.  Too scared to go to the doctors because I'm always there - any suggestions please? 
Hi  âI've recently been diagnosed with depression and a borderline eating disorder - I suffered from anorexia as a teenager but had largely managed to overcome it whilst at university and throughout my 20s.  âAt the moment I am slipping back into old habits fast and both my CBT therapist (for the depression) and GP have noticed that I've lost weight. I am however a normal weight (BMI OF 21.5) and although I've been open about my depression and fear of falling back into an eating disorder with my GP I am not able to admit it openly to anyone yet as I don't know how to deal with it. I have tried to convince him that I'm ok by agreeing to be weighed today although I do now feel worse. He also asked me to get some blood tests done to check my thyroid and I am to go back tomorrow morning for this.  âI am aneamic and take iron suppliments - I know that usually before a blood test that you shouldn't take them so that they can get a better picture. Is this true for other suppliments too? Ihave been taking a multivitamin tablet as well as extra B group vitamins for a while now. I remember reading once that in order to make the doctors believe that you were eating you should take extra vitamins in order to alter your blood test results. Can this really affect the outcome of any blood tests? 
I've recently lost a substantial amount of weight  ... 20 stone down to 12 stone in under a year on a vlcd ... my problem now is i often feel the need to eat ... but can't  just eat a little ..  i binge .. ransack the cupboards and eat everything ... then end up making myself sick through  guilt and fear of gaining weight again ... I'm  really worried that I'm  becoming bulimic ... i can't  understand why I'm  doing it and feel helplessly out of control ... any advice?? 
I have never had an problems with food in relation to weight, over-eating, restricting etc.. but sometimes find I cannot cope with eating in front of people.  I also have an absolute terror of my stomach rumbling.  I've no idea why this is or what caused it but I will go to any lengths to get away from whoever I'm with if I feel it's about to happen.  This combined with not always being able to eat in front of people is causing me so much stress at the moment and I honestly don't know what to do. 
I used to be able to get away with bingeing late at night (not every night, just when I can't fight  the urge to) and wake up the next day bloated and sick but that was all. However, six months ago, something changed. I now have chronic bloating after eating, heart burn sometimes after a normal meal and horrendous heartburn continually for a few days after such a binge. I am really frightened. A year ago, I had my usual camera check down my stomach (I have Barretts eosophegus) and the consultant said all my tissues were inflamed due to acid reflux (I was on an iron supplement at the time that didn't agree with me and I stupidly kept taking it, on doctors advice). He found nothing in biopsies though and I don't have to see him again. I am not blaming the supplements as I used to be able to take them but that time around, i couldn't digest them at all.  I am wondering if anyone has had symptoms like this, if I had had a stomach ulcer back then, would the consultant have found this and said  it to  me? I am also wondering if it  might be my gallbladder, I just don't know.  I am going back to my doctor and telling her what has been going on.  I have been too afraid and ashamed to say what has been happening due to the eating disorder (have been afraid to be completely open because of it going on my record and being also 45 now).  I had a whole series of blood tests just a few weeks ago and everything came back good, but I think that they dont always tell the full story or am I wrong about that, is that at  least something positive?  Also my age is 45 and I am perimenopausal (my periods are very irregular), could I be getting digestive problems now due to my hormones, seperate to the eating disorder issues? (if that question makes sense).  If anyone  can help, I  would so appreciate it. I don't want to go for another endoscopy but I am going to ask for the  notes on the last one, which  I didn't really take in at the time (all I know is that the consultant was happy with the biopsy results afterwards).  I am really frightened and I can't stop blaming myself. 
Hello, I am a 15 year old girl and have been struggling with depression, anxiety, and OCD of a sort for over a year and it's because worse over time. This includes the usual thing such as panic attacks, loads of anxiety, self-harm such as cutting, and the usual depression related emotions and thoughts. So to start off in about May last year I had a random weight gain. I gained about 25 pounds or so and had also gotten much bigger than I was used to being. Since I was small before the weight gain and entirely fine with my body but I was easily influenced by my opinion and thoughts since I had been recovering from years of self abuse. So when I had this weight gain I instantly was shocked and looked at myself as huge and fat, mainly because I was bigger than a lot of the girls my age and older. My Mother said I was just growing into my women's body and that it is normal to have a bit of weight gain but I didn't expect it to be that bad. But it was bad in my eyes. I had saddle bags, loads of cellulite and stretch marks, my hips were huge and I basically had a granny body. It was hideous. I literally felt sick looking at my bod and had because so obsessed with it. All of this rapidly caused depression and soon I had started cutting (which is stupid and didn't help) and researching anorexia diets and thinspiration pictures and diets. I started starving myself on and off because I could never really fully deprive myself of food.  The most I did was a week and a half but then my parents found out and started making sure I was eating. To avoid suspicion I started eating less and missing a few meals when they weren't looking but then they found out again and I was forced to start eating. They kept their eyes on me at all times. I kept paying for all of these choices and soon because even more obsessed with my body and would do everything I could to try and lose weight. I needed to be skinny and I needed to be beautiful or else I was Inferior to everyone. I literally still think and feel like all of this. It's because so bad that I pick at everything and constantly have thoughts of taking a knife and just cutting away parts of my flesh. It's sick, I know and I already feel crazy. I keep starving myself every now and then and I've been working out but I'm not getting results. I still look like a fat and ugly person. I'm still bigger than everyone my age and older and it's really taking a toll on me. I honestly can't take it anymore because all I want to do is cry and hide from the world. Please help me. 
I got sick with the stomach flu in the beginning of may, and had to see a doctor. She wanted a blood test and said I was overweight and needed to eat healthier/exercise more. Before I got sick, I used to eat fast food a lot. Anyways, I got the blood test and everything was fine, except my liver enzymes. They were extremely high, and I had to get an ultrasound. It turns out I have a fatty liver, so the dr told me no fatty foods and fried foods, along with more vegetables/fruits and exercise. So I've been doing just that, and from the beginning of may til now, I've lost 32 pounds. It's all great, but I've always felt a bit lightheaded every day and noticed my heart rate was slower than before (around 80-90, and now I'm like 56-70 resting) until just recently when it seemed like I had a panic attack. My chest tightened, my mouth got dry, and my legs felt weak. I went to the ER and they said I was fine, but like recently I've been feeling a bit more lightheaded since then, and it comes and goes randomly. For my diet, I've been getting around 600-1000 calories a day (which I now realize is bad for my body weight) and have started upping my calorie intake since last week (It's now around 2000). Do you think the lightheadedness/chest pressure is from me not getting enough food? Because I can't sleep (insomnia), I get lightheaded at random times of the day, I'm tired all day, and I get chest tightness at random times, and my appetite fluxuates. I'm probably sure it's anxiety (even though I've never had anxiety before in my life, and my doctor said I have it when I went to go visit her). Idk I'm like all worried because I feel like since I used to eat low calorie meals for a long time, that it affected me bad. Will this feeling go away if I continue eating more food each day?  
Ok so the back of my tongue is eroded away from acid reflux I can see my veins that iv never seen b4 n shouldn't see coz it's eroded away. I'm really scared n fear my throat will burst or one veins will bust n I'll bleed to death. Is this tissue repairable can it grow back coz I don't think it can so many things can heal in body but I don't think that does. I'm really worried. Anyone any experience with this from bullemia please ?  Thanks  
I don't know what to say about how this year has panned out for me so far.  I've always had problems with eating and food. When I was younger I used to be a really bad asthmatic and was constantly on steroids (the little Red Devils I called them) and i would always gain weight and have the chipmunk looking face from bloating out from them. I would be called fat by my brother and sister, then kids on the road, in school and then by all my aunties, nanny and uncles. This played havoc on my self esteem and I never really had friends.  When I was 7, my brother passed away from adult cancer at the age of 12 and things never fully recovered. My mam switched off and everyone became so guarded and no one really smiled.  But things slowly got better.  When I was 15-16, I had a friend who was so skinny and small. So I got fed up being the 'fat friend' and decides to lose weight. I went from size 16 to a size 8 in a few months and would skip meals and I looked so drawn. It might not sound small but I'm 5'8 and medium build it was. This went on for a year or so and then all I remember is me starting to eat my meals again and didn't worry anymore.  Now moving forward to this year, things have been really tough. At the start of the year, I went temporally blind in my right eye and I didn't think much of it as I was on antibiotics and thought it was a side effect as I've never had that brand before. But it turned out I had optic neuritis and was kept in hospital for three days on steroidal drips. I've had a fear of the steroids since I was a child so this was a trigger for me towards my bad eating habits. I gained all the weight back on that I lost with my PT which took me nearly a year to achieve and I started getting really down. I was also being told that the optic neuritis was an indicator that I am being tested for MS and that I will definitely have it when I am older. I am to find out in August if I have it now and what I am suppose to do. I am in complete limbo at the moment. As a result of that, I started getting headaches so bad I couldn't lift my head off the pillow and I am only able to manage two half days in work! Everything was going downhill for me.  Then all of a sudden, my best friend who was battling CF died and I cannot come to terms with it.  My eating habits went from bad to worse after this. I went from being 61kg to 56kg in less than a month and went up to 58kg after the shock of my bestfriend passing and then dropped right down to 51kg in little over a month! I couldn't cope with eating more than 300 calories and had to be under 5g of fat. I would only have a cup of tea for my breakfast and I would flush my porridge down the toliet to make it look that I was eating to my mam and dad. I would have a Diet Coke for lunch and then have a salad for dinner that would only consist of lettuce tomatoes feta cheese and one slice of onion. I never liked red meat but I used to love chicken but I can't manage myself to eat chicken anymore so if I did eat anything with my salad it would be tuna. Even eating my salad would be hard for me to finish. I have to leave something on my plate so that in myself I felt better knowing I didn't finish it all. I just felt so numb I finally admitted to my mam after her fighting with me nearly everyday that I was starving myself and that I don't have any interest in life anymore and I went to the doctor. She prescribed me antidepressants and took my weight and bmi which was 18.1 which is underweight for my height but not severely. If it wasn't for my mam, I would of left it and went further.  I'm starting to try finish all my dinner and I am introducing my breakfast which I can only seem to manage an apple and a few strawberries but it's a start.  Anyone who is in recovery, is it normal to feel like a pain in your abdominal region at night like you have a lot of gas? At the moment I'm getting that but at the moment I'm still only eating before 7pm.  Thank you for listening and I hope to hear for people who would understand because no one in my family or friends can relate even though they try to understand they can't.  
Hi, I'm new. I was wondering if anyone has claimed for pip when suffering from anorexia? I was claiming dla and am now in the process of claiming pip. I attended a medical assessment on 23rd June and now I am awaiting my result.    I have a question re my medical...I was seen by a physio nurse and she went through the questions on the pip application form which I answered truthfully as she typed. When it came to the physical, however, she asked me if I would just like to decline as she felt I would not gain anything from the physical tests. I just said yes and the assessment was ended. What I would like to know is why would she ask me to decline the physical tests? Could it be that she felt they were not needed because she had enough info for her assessment. I do admit that my weight is extremely low and I am fragile so do you think she expected me to not complete them successfully anyway? It is so hard to predict because she was nice but then I have heard so many horror stories of assessors lying and therefore am I too trusting? I would appreciate your thought or similar experiences.   So has anyone successfully claimed pip for anorexia, and if so what were you awarded thank you. 
This started about nine or so months ago. A little after the birth of my daughter. I'd gained so much weight and I'd started making myself vomit after meals as well as taking laxatives.   My husband found out when I started vomiting up blood and decoupled ulcers. I promised to stop and I did for a while but started up again. After a while , I barely had a gag reflex and find it to hard to make myself sick. So it stopped. But I contuined the laxative abuse.  But then my grandfather died of cancer and I just slowly have stopped eating and my laxative abuse has gotten worse. I don't eat for days and when I do eat, the most I'll take in is about 900 calories on a good day. I normally eat roughly 500 to 600 and I've become obessed with counting them. If I go over that I feel horrible and get depressed. If I don't know how many calories are in something I want eat it. I have to weight myself all the time. I'm guessing I do at least fifteen times a day.    The laxative abuse has gotten bad. I take about five or so derclax, eat a whole bar of the chocolate ex lax, or drink some milk of magnesia. I do this everytime I eat unless I'm fasting.   I've tried to eat normal, I really have. But whenever I do I break down crying because the thought of all that food in me makes me sick. I feel like I don't deserve it or that I'm losing control when I do eat. Even if it's just a few chips or sething.  I know this isn't normal but does it sound like an eating disorder? Or do I just have a bad relationship with food? I'm not sure if I could be aware I have an eating disorder. And my weight range is normal. ( I actually just stopped being over wight due to this behavior. )   
Hi i have recnelty tried to recover from annorexia. When i follow my plan and stick to it i feel soo guilty i trun to self harm or get angry and punch items or myself.

Could someone help me please? 
Hi guys! I'm 18 years old (girl) and I'm a "recovered" physically but mentally I'm a wreck. About a year ago in April I began dieting at height of 5 feet 3.5 inches and weight of like 130-135 pounds (I've always been on the thicker side and got sick of it) and eventually I got more and more restrictive. By the end of december this year I was about 99 pounds and incredibly thrilled with myself, and I don't think i was anorexic at all.   My parents stepped in and ruined it, taking me to all sorts of stupid doctors and therapists and literally forced me to gain weight from January till now (almost july) and even though I water loaded and put it off for a while, I am now fluctuating between 110 and 115 pounds and I am devastated. I hate my body and looking in the mirror makes me cry. All my hard work is wasted, my control over food is gone, and sometimes I randomly binge on food until I can hardly move.  How do I lose weight without raising my parent's suspicions or concern? I'm supposed to go off to college in August and I need to not be considered unstable.  Thank youu!! 
I asked this question on a different website but haven't gotten any responses, so I might as well try this.   I am a female, but I identify as a man, 5 feet and 5 inches, and I currently weigh 124. However around 2 months ago I weighed 145, more or less.   Is that healthy or should I actually be concerned? I'm worried that I'm just being over dramatic.   My eating habits aren't great as I usually just have a few snacks like a candy bar, chips, cheese and crackers, and sometimes fruit, but it's just one or two of these plus dinner sometimes. Like I'll eat half a bar for breakfast and the other half for lunch, and then an actual meal at dinner. Sometimes I eat more than 1 meal.   I've started tracking my calories intake and it's pretty much 1000, and I have to do a lot of walking.   I think I might have ARFID,  but I'm not sure if the people at my school that could maybe help me know what that is.  
Lately I've been having obsessive horrible thoughts about how disgusting my body is and how I want to lose weight and I want to make myself throw up and not eat. I can't bring myself to actually do it (I think I love food too much) and that makes it worse. and I also tore my ACL & MCL recently so the fact that I can't exercise also makes it worse. it's killing me and I don't know what to do. All I've been doing is thinking about it and I don't want to think about it anymore. But lately every time I eat something "bad" I have the biggest urge to vomit and that urge usually lasts until the next day. My metabolism is already fcked up as it is. I have thyroid problems (the one that makes you gain weight and I take medicine for it everyday).  I can't eat normal meals. I tried to and I can't. I don't get hungry till like 4 pm usually so then I have a snack and then I have dinner and then I have another snack and that's usually how I eat which is horrible I know and I usually feel like I need to throw my dinner up. And when I wake up in the morning, it feels like there is something stuck in my throat that needs to come out. I don't know what to do or how to fix it. My mind is just so confused right now. Does anyone feel the same way? Is this the start of an eating disorder or is my mind just absolutely fcked right now? 
Everyone around me thinks I have a problem but I'm not sure and I don't even know where to turn if I am willing to accept that I might have.  I am 40 years old and food and calories dominate my life but I do eat, I eat 1300 calories per day and surely if I had an eating disorder I would be eating much less than that?  My BMI is currently 18.4, I know it's low but not drastic low and I still get my periods so nothing to indicate a problem there.  I have depression, very bad depression in fact and it feels like there are a lot of things in my life that I can't control, my weight is the only thing I can control so I feel that if I gain weight I have failed at yet another thing in life and I feel almost as if I want to be invisible in the world and being as small as possible helps me to feel like I am.  I have poor appetite because of my depression, this would be upsetting to most people but I am thrilled since it means that keeping my weight low is easy.  I do not view myself as fat nor do I view myself as thin, I know I have very thin arms and my collarbone  is visible but on the whole I view myself as being normal size, my husband and adult daughter think I am very thin though and get upset when they hug me because they say I feel boney.  I did go over my calorie allowance one day last week and just felt utterly depressed about it to be honest, like a worthless failure.  So now I need to decide where to turn, I did tell my gp all of this months ago, she told me to tell my mental health nurse but I did and she just wrote it on my notes and left it at that, I am now 5 pounds lighter and feel like even if I do need help I am being passed around and don't know who or where to get it from.  Where do I go? What do I do? I'm confused, upset, exhausted with everything and feel so alone, the depression makes it hard to see things clearly and I just want to see the right person who can tell me if I have a problem and what to do about it if I do.    
Hi all My daughter over the last few years has been putting a lot of weight on at a fast rate and to be honest I am worried sick.  I have tried to speak to her  about this and supported her when she has at times tried to lose weight..  I am aware this is her way of dealing with her emotions but I feel Iam losing my daughter as she treats me with coldness and indifference..Its like the girl I brought up is becoming insensitive, uncaring, hurtful, selfish etc etc What I wanted to know..  Is this change in her attitude  part of her addiction or just my daughter being hurtful to me because she is now living with her partner and has a problem with me.. She is all the good things I know she is with him (she is 25 yrs old) I am a good mum and brought her up on my own.. I try and support her as much as I can..She can be very negative all the time and always tired and for being so young does not go out as much with her friends etc..

Hi . Got a few things going on but does anybody else think this is an eating disorder because I don't. People I know are worried about me. I like to have a set routine of when I eat because I'm skinny and I know that if I don't eat I will feel dizzy and possibly faint, but if I'm busy doing something else, I forget. It's not that I'm fussy or don't like food because I do, but I suffer with anxiety and when I'm anxious I physically cannot eat. The smells of foods really get to me. I can't eat if it's not my normal time to eat and I feel guilty if I eat something unhealthy because it probably means I won't be hungry later. I don't dislike food, I just prefer it I've chosen it and prepared it myself and I'm at home when I eat it. Sometimes I get really hungry late at night which stops me being able to eat so I'll go and eat something. The fact is I'm eating, so are people right to be worried about me?  
I don't know when I'm hungry and when I'm full. It feels the same to me. I can feel my stomach rumbling when I'm hungry, but when I eat it doesn't leave even when I've eating enough. I can feel my stomach is full but I'm still hungry. This causes me to eat a lot of food. I ate 2,000 calories for breakfast yesterday and I still felt hungry. I don't know how else to explain this. Does anyone else feel this way? 
I've had this problem pretty much all my life as far as I know. Whenever I eat a hamburger( like a big hamburger from a nice restaurant) I'll get like half way and it starts getting difficult to even bite into it with getting a head ache and feeling like I'm about to throw up. It's not like I'm full, I usually end not being able to finish my meal and filling up on something more bland. It happens with pretty much any meal with a lot of flavor. They only things that I can eat non stop is like rice, bread, and other grains.  
I've been overweight ever since I could remember. I am 5'7 and I weigh 193 lb. Most people tell me oh you don't look "that bad" and you're fine because you are tall and this and that but I don't feel fine at all. My self esteem and confidence are gone, I don't feel pretty and I don't feel like I look pretty in anything I wear. But now, it isn't just an issue of appearances, It is starting to effect my health as well. I cant run or jog without dying a minute later, I developed acid reflux disease and asthma very recently and I know if i just lose weight I'll get better.I can't enjoy most of the things like dancing, and going out with friends because i am always self conscious and it really starting to effect my academic life as well. I try to diet and and excercise but I just lose interest quick because I don't see any results. and it is not a matter of oh i need to stop eating this or that because i dont eat junk food or soda or fried or anything like that I just eat too much I seriously can't stop eating. I dont know if its the stress or whatever but i am really really tired of this and I need help 
Hello,  Just wondered if anyone could shed some light on my situation? I'm a 26 year old female, 5ft 2 and weigh 7.5 stone.   I have always been selective with the food that I eat since I was a child. I still eat everything that I should but just less portions compared to others.  I've noticed that I don't like when my food touches one another in a plate. It has to be in small portions but separated.   I was diagnosed with something called Reative Hypoglycemia late last year. It means I have pre-diabetics and I have to control it with my diet. This means I have to eat regularly, every 3 hours to be exact or else I get dizzy, limbs start shaking and on ocassions I have had seizures.   Since I was diagnosed I have been eating much healthier as I had to cut out sugar and junk food from my diet. However, as I've never been a great lover of food, eating so regularly is starting to make me feel sick.  Do I have an eating disorder?!  Thank you  J x   
I've always had bad self esteem and body image issues. But recently since I had my doctor I've started taking laxatives to lose weight. I'll take a whole box or drink a whole bottle of milk magnisea.  I've cut back to only one small meal every few days and right now I haven't really eaten in four days.   I have to weight myself contently because if I don't know how much I weight I freak out. If I eat anything my first thought is to get it out of me. Food in general has been making feel sick lately. It's becoming gross. Even the site of it or somebody eating is gross.   I need to eat but the number on the scale just keeps going down and I'll tell myself this is my last laxative. I'll eat tomorrow. But the number will be low and I'll think that if I do it for one more day then it'll get lower.   I'm wondering if I could be devopling an ED. I'm not super thin. Infact, ever since having my dsughter I'm a little over weight. Would I even be aware of it if I had one?  
Suffered with aggressive Bulimia & Restricting & obsessive exercising for a year and a half now but suffered with episodes of bulimia since my first episode in year 6 in primary school which would have made me 10 or 11. I turned 20 in November.  August 2012 I weighed just over 16 stone, January 2014 - Current weight is 142 lbs/ 10.2 stone Ive lost 6 stone in a year.  Ive been with my current boyfriend for a year and 5 months, so met him basically at my heaviest and hes known about my ED since things first started getting nasty really; I love him more than anything and despite the fact that he hates that I do it, he has always supported me and never pushed me. Recently my mood swings have got worse and all I do is push him away, I never feel good enough, always feel ugly, or disgusting and can never see my place in the world and that place ever being happy. Hed never cheat on me but I constantly question him and if we row the first thing that comes into my head is " go find a nice skinny girl ". Its putting so much pressure on us now, We cant enjoy simple things like meals out because what's the point in him paying for a nice meal when ive got to the point where I cant even wait till im home and im alone to purge, instead opting for frequent toilet breaks instead. I know im hurting him, I know my family know but are too scared to confront me so instead be idiots and remove the lock on the bathroom door. Im really secretive about most things and my "friends" haven't got a lot of time for me because I never want to go out drinking or doing anything that involves calories or food and half the time that im with them I cant help talking about the gym or loosing weight but I don't mean to but Its like everything I used to enjoy has gone.   I don't really want to change because to me my bulimia is the power I never had...Its control in moments of weakness, its eating the same stuff that skinny people eat, enjoying it then not getting fat....getting compliments from the people that used to bully me. I know im going to loose him eventually if I cant resolve what ever this is in my head but what if he asked me to make a choice?I can honestly say I couldn't choose. Health warnings don't phase me, rather be teethless and skinny right? The only thing that bothers me from time to time is that I cant enjoy my favourite food (Indian) but that's probably a good thing anyway.  Ive put off work and gone back to study and to go uni yes to produce a good career but it means another 3 years of not having to be around people and share the same toilets too often. Hospitalised myself last year with sever potassium deficiency and vomiting blood & cant remember a single day in the last year where I wasn't sick.   I need to know that there is a way back from this, I need to know that there are people that have been as deep as me and have got better when getting better has been the last thing that you want to do. Thanks in advance.    
Two months ago, my boyfriend dumped me, leaving me terribly, horribly and completely devastated. During the first weeks, I didn't eat much because I was so upset, and lost weight, which was weirdly a slight and only comfort in grieving. Being happy about it, when the healing process started and I got my appetite back, I didn't want to go back to my normal weight. I started chewing food and spitting occasionally . And since then, I started doing it almost everyday. With cheese, cookies, chips (things I don't allow myself normally to eat) I made myself purged number of times (not on a regular basis, but few times) since two months after coming back from the restaurant. For the rest, my eating habits are quite normal, aside for the fact that I always calculate portions and THINK about my weight everyday, all the time.   I've had some anxiety problems since my breakup, including one panick attack. I don't know if any one has ever developed eating disorder after a breakup? (I'm still in grieving mode). And also I'm seeking general opinion about my condition, IS IT an eating disorder that I have? Does anyone have advice for me, as I really can't stop chewing and spitting, and I think it's discuting. Thanks in advance xxx 
Granddaughter lives with me and has been fighting extremely low potassium this past week or however long.  Daughter had to call ambulance for her as she was on the side of the road about passed out.  Very heavy chest, doctor in emergency room told her that if his potassium had been that low, he would have been dead.  She is now 27, and has fought binging/purging for many years.  Stress always exacerbates the issue, the latest was breakup with boyfriend, before that going through a divorce, no children thank God.  Her Mom had these issues but overcame them but my granddaughter just seems to not be able to get past this horrible illness.  She came to live with me so I see the results of the food at night and cleaning up the commode the next day, I also see where the food goes.  She has abused laxatives, pretty much keeps a bottle of milk of magnesia handy at all times.  I just would like to see a light at the end of the tunnel.  After the divorce and moving back home, she lost her medical insurance so that is tough also.  She has an appointment next week with a county facility so she can pay on a sliding scale and the labwork is free.  I guess I'm very concerned as her potassium chloride 20MEQ are out as of yesterday and her appointment isn't until next week and I worry about her potassium dropping any lower.   I have bought coconut water, V8, dried apricots, salmon, tuna, clams, clam chowder, kale, spinach, avocados and she is eating these and for the most part they seem to be staying down but she eats so little and works out at the gym every day which I think she should curtail.  She is a hair stylist and the sweetest girl ever, breaks this grandmothers heart.  Oh yes, I also have blackstrap molasses that she uses in green tea as this is another good source for potassium.  Her Mom also had this going on for quite a few years and finally overcame it just to have a brain abscess in 2013, yet another story.  This is one tired grandmother worried to pieces that we will lose this girl.  Any encouraging words are appreciated.  So tough with no insurance, she is not eligible as yet at work and she has to wait until open enroll with the ACA insurance. 
I'm struggling quite a lot with my anxiety and low mood. When I get this bad all I can do is obsess over the amount I am eating, constantly thinking about everything I've eaten that day and how much fatter I am going to get. I am 13 stone, and this is definitely overweight.   I want to eat all the time, I'm constantly hungry but only ever want to eat fast food, chocolate, sweets, nice things. In my mind I tell myself the food will make me feel better, and that I deserve it. But then my mind starts to fight back telling me I'll get even fatter, I'll die from being fat.  I don't know what to do - please help me! 
I am a adult with anorexia and have heart problems, anaemia and severe depression and need some support. My gp is supportive and thinks I want to get better but I don't feel I am ready is this the depression talking?? 
Allow me to explain.  There's been a short period of time where I was doing an extreme diet but without knowing anything about anorexia, I did weigh myself a lot which motivated me to lose weight but after a period of time the starvation did stop. I do not self diagnose either anyway.  But I feel like since then something has been wrong even If I never really noticed it, sooner after that I've still had times or some days I heavily restricted or just starved then overate and it was a cycle. I'm 13 years old, I weigh average for my age and height. My weight is 55kg, but ever since then I still felt really conscious about my body shape to this very day. Then as time went by even if I wasn't starving. I'd just binge sometimes and feel extreme guilt then throw up my food, at least some of it. Some time has passed since then but in general my eating pattern is just out of control, it's making me really unhappy and I don't know what to do. I either snack really often or binge or heavily restrict or throw up if I feel very very bad about it. I can't stop thinking about food at all and It's making me really upset considering I'm also still really conscious about my weight. My parents are kind of brushing this off too when I bring up my problems with eating. Has anyone ever been in this situation before, or have any idea if these are signs or have any advice on this at all? Also I do get really anxious in real life but also I have no proof I could have anxiety and like I said I do not self diagnose nor really have a way to get help in case things like this have something to do with eating disorders. I've  also had really negative views on myself and my body for a really long time now.  
I have had a diagnosed ed for 2 years however I am now st my lowest weight and even restrict fluids only taking 200 mild a day if that and will only eat roughly 500-600 calories a day it has been advised as I have so much gastro trouble now when eatin anything I should go into hospital via a gastro ward for help with my ed just wondering if anybody has any advice or experience with this at all or should I even consider hospital ??  
daughters 14, ive noticed she has lost a lot of weight, she was 115 she is now 100 but has denied it, the other day i found plastic bags, cups and boxes full of food and i know she dosnt eat lunch and dosnt eat breakfast , she is 5"3 and 100 and i dont know what to do, is anyone else having the same problem, is 100 too thin?  she has also got really cold some times blue hands and feet and lips, should i take her to hospital, what would happen to her. if anyone can help i would be extreamly thankfull  
Every time I see food on the stove or in the lunch line I don't feel like I can eat it because it just doesn't look appealing. A family member insisted that I eat some Chinese food they bought last night and I made a bowl and I couldn't eat all of it and I didn't even get a lot of it. I tried to eat more of it but it made me really uncomfortable and I got really upset over it so I stopped and put it in the fridge. Before last night I hadn't eaten anything 3 days prior. I'm not sure why I don't seem to be able to enjoy food even when I know I need it. 
I don't know if anyone has had a similar experience to this or can perhaps shed some light on these experiences.   I currently am experiencing successive colds/flu (I've had back to back colds since before Christmas).  Now, this would make sense if I was still starving myself, because eating disorders lower your immune system.  However, these colds are occuring alongside my recovery, increase in weight and increase in nutrition. I am in a much healthier weight range and so I don't understand why my immune system is getting worse not better. It's almost like it's worse now, then when I starved myself.  Can anyone relate to this? Does anyone know how long the body can take to recover particularly surrounding vital organs such as immune system?  Thanks 
I've been bulimic for about 15 years now.  I'm not proud of it and I want to get out of this cycle.  What's causing me to write is a worrying sign that I've had for the last three days.  When I vomit, I've been getting grey patches in my vision.  Is this normal?  Should I worry about it?  It hasn't happened to me before.  I don't know what to do.  Should I see a doctor?  I don't get on with my GP and it's hard to get an appointment with my psychiatrist.  Does anyone have any experience of this? 
As per my last post I am not actually sure if I do have an eating disorder although I accept that my thought patterns are worrying.  I spoke to my GP on the phone a few days before Christmas and she is going to have a more in depth discussion with me face to face at my January 6th appointment.  Anyway here is my worrying thought pattern, on Christmas morning it was 6 days since I had recorded my weight, it was 7 stone 7 1/2.  I didn't binge on the day but I ate more than usual, about 2000 I think but I did not weigh out my food portions that day because I wanted to be relaxed about food for one day.  Usually I limit to 1300 per day, I am only 156cm and still have a 19.5 BMI, I am not very active due to anxiety disorder so don't burn an awful lot either.  Today it is 7 stone 8, okay my doctor told me not to go lower than 7 stone 12 so I know it's fine but I wanted to do it slowly for my own sanity.  I want to see what the extra calories at Christmas will do and then aim to add 0.5 pounds per week until I get to 7 stone 12 as advised by the doctor.  But I am scared, despite only eating around the 1300 mark for the past 3 days I already gained half a pound, what if it keeps piling on fast?  I was going to wait until Jan 1st, one week clear of Christmas and then increase my calories but now I am too scared to in case it's already out of control, I am trying so hard not to weight myself again until Friday now but I'm scared that when I do I am going to see a huge gain.  I am feeling like I want to cut to 1000 calories to stop the gain but I know that would be bad and unhealthy.  Please help me, why did I gain 0.5 pounds so fast and is it just going to keep piling on now even if I eat the same as I was before Christmas day? 
Hi!  A few years ago I lost a significant amount of weight when I transferred to a raw vegan diet, and my family and doctors believe this happened in the context of an eating disorder.  Anyway, ever since then it's been a crazy ride!  I wasn't able to regain the weight I lost for over a year, so finally my mom put me into a residential treatment center where I gained a significant amount of weight.  I never completely finished the treatment, however, so now that I'm out of the center, I'm eating pretty much like a "normal person" (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) and exercising moderately, but somehow I'm losing weight!!  I don't understand how that's happening!  I know people who eat even less than me or people who exercise more than me and maintain their weights!  I don't eat restrictively and I don't exercise excessively -- but somehow every time I get on the scale my weight drops significantly since the last time... It's scary because the doctors say that if I don't stop losing weight I will have to go back to residential, but I really don't want to!!  I don't know what to do!!  What's up with my body??  
This time last year I was 12 stone 3, I am a 38 year old female and only 5 ft 1 1/2 so was clearly obese.  In february I decided to do something about it and I now weigh 7 stone 10, at a recent check up my doctor told me not to lose any more weight and said that 20 is the lowest a BMI should be and I am very close to it, I thought 18.5 was the lowest but she disagrees.  Now the thing is I do eat but I am very strict about not going over a certain amount of calories and despite the fact that I am still losing weight I can't bring myself to eat any more than that.  I keep promising myself that I wont lose more but I see the scale go down and feel such a buzz that it's like an addiction.  I weigh myself daily, struggle to accept natural fluctations and count every single calorie I eat.  I also feel really pleased with myself if I have calories left from my allowance at the end of the day and don't eat them.  Part of me thinks yes it's a problem but I allow myself an amount that is supposed to be my TDEE and it's 1390 so it's not drastic low although I still lose weight on that so it probably isn't enough and as I said I feel pleased with myself if I am 100-200 under it every day and feel guilty if I eat right up to it.  Then I think it's normal to be scared of getting obese again because I was like it for 8 years and miserable so I just don't know, I'm not sure if I do have an actual problem or if I am just terrified of going back to how I was.  My husband says it's time to stop but I just keep thinking he only sees me as being thin because he is about 10 pounds overweight so to him 'normal' seems very thin.  I feel a bit silly writing this now, I think I am fine and just don't want to risk getting big again but I will post anyway to see what others think, thank you for any opinions. 
Hi, I am 23 and have been bulimic for about 2 years. I lost about 10 stone with my bulimia in about 8 months which i know is bad but it was good to finally lose the weight (i had been obese and struggling to lose it for my whole life). I know i am out of control with the binge purge cycle, but i dont know how to make it stop. My weight fluctuates so much, but recently it has gone up and up and up and i am so scared i am going to get back to the size i was.   I am seeing an eating disorders clinic, but i am really lonely and having a hard time. My friends here dont know how to help me and are withdrawing, my only other friends are abroad and i cant speak to them all the time. I feel like a burden, but i just need people to talk to and sympathise with me and help me get through those moments when i need to give up. Does anyone else feel lonely - even though they are surrounded by people.   How can you make yourself stop? I am scared if i stop purging, i will continue binging and i will never lose the weight or keep it off.    
I was bulimic. I forget about that part of my life. Actually, I donât forget at all, I pretend. I pretend I wasnât dumb enough to get lost in all of it. I pretend that Iâm okay with the fact that I lost my best friend of 14 years because of it, I pretend it didnât matter, that it didn't affect me, and I pretend I wonât be tempted to do it again.      I havenât done it in over a year. I am so incredibly proud of myself. Every time I workout, every time I eat a big green salad instead of binge eating, every time I look at myself in the mirror and smile, I am proud. Itâs taken me a really long time to get here and I donât give myself enough credit for the work Iâve put in. Itâs been difficult. And the most difficult part was doing it on my own. This isnât something I advertise. Iâve told a few people I cared about of course, but at the end of the day, no one else could have helped me, only I could have stopped myself. But, I just wishâ¦ I wish someone told me they were proud of me. I wish someone realized that I overcame something toxic, an addiction, something that was stronger than me for a really long time. My mom, my sister, my boyfriend, my best friends, a stranger. anyone.      Iâve been pretending that that part of my life never happened. Unfortunately, the more time spent avoiding admitting it, the heavier it gets. I feel as though I never got closure. Itâs always going to be there, a big dark cloud. It may be far away for now, but I know itâs there, and I know it always will be. I still think about doing it sometimes. It almost seems fun to me. The easiness of it all. How wonderful you feel afterwards, the feeling of emptiness, flat stomach, knowing youâll wake up feeling skinny and ready to go. Isnât that horrible? superficial? sad? Reading over this, I feel pathetic, I feel as though Iâm weak. So weak. Why do I care about that stuff? Iâm not fat, Iâm not fat at all, Iâm healthy. AND if I really needed to lose weight, I have two completely functional legs! I can move my ass and go for a run! But Instead I chose the easy way out. I chose to kneel down by a dirty toilet bowl and force myself to throw up by shoving fingers down my throat. How lovely. Thatâs not exactly something you want to tell your kids in the future. That is if I can have kids after all the trauma Iâve caused my body. I was selfish. I caused pain to my friends and to my family. Iâve taken advantage of the healthy body that was given to me, something so many people would kill for. I was selfish.      I donât want to do it. I donât want bulimia to be apart of my story ever again. I know it happened, and I accept that. Iâm proud of myself for being strong enough to stop on my own, and I know I can do better. Itâs not worth it, itâs never been. Although the cloud is there, and temptation will come again, Iâll be stronger. Iâll be stronger for myself and for everyone who loves me and cares about me. 
I think I've always had a problem with food, I can remember being 12 and making myself throw up to calm myself down. It was always something I could manage on my own. The need to strave myself and throw up came in and out of my teenages years as stress came in and out.   However, this year things became really bad. My family began to notice, and though the support they did offer was limited due to me being able to hide it. Well them finding out made me realise myself I probably have a problem.   I am writing this post to ask for any tips in how to stop it coming back.  After this summer I dropped to my lowest weight, but I've worked really hard the past few months and now I'm back on track with a healthly weight. However, uni is becoming REALLY hard and REALLY stressful. I can see myself limited my food and obessing over my weight - because it seems to take my mind off my studies.   I just really dont want to become ill again. Anyone here been through something similar?

Iv recently been experiencing some depression & panic attacks. Iv had bulimia for 3 years but Iv stopped & since had panic attacks. Anyone else experienced this? Any help is much appreciated  
Hi i am 16 year old girl and I'm recovering from anorexia. One and a half year ago i started "dieting" aka having anorexic behaviours and dropped to 44 kilos (I'm 5.2) and lost my period. I started "recovering", gained 2 kilos and got period back but just for one month cause then i relapsed and dropped to 42 kilos this time. I lost my period for 3 months and then my mum pushed me to recover. I still wasn't eating enough though (1300 calories)  and I didn't get my period back so she took me to the doctro, i got some medication and i got 1 period but then it stopped again. Now I've really started recovery and I can't stop eating!!!!

Hi everyone, I'm a 16 year old female. I'm really short at about 153cm, current weight now I have no idea, but I have gained a lot since my lowest weight at BMI 14.7.  I have been struggling with anorexia since June this year (though the disordered thoughts have been inherent in me since forever). My school noticed and forced my mum to take me to the doctor, so I've currently been in "recovery" for about a month now. I don't think I've had anorexia that long, so I'm not really a serious case I guess. I'm currently in outpatient treatment and my next appointment with my dietician is in 2 weeks.   One and a half weeks ago I sort of developed BED according to my therapist. I got so so so hungry, I was eating loads all day and couldn't stop thinking about food. It made me feel really really gross: I ate an entire large jar of PB by myself in 5 days, I had bars and bars of chocolate, bowl after bowl of oatmeal.... Even when I was physically full, I just COULDN'T stop. When I went back for my appointment 3 days ago, I was given a new meal plan on the grounds that my previous meal plan was "too little" for me. But the thing is: the urges have stopped, I think I'm in much better control of myself around food now, and there is no need for an increased intake. And I'm so so scared to follow this new meal plan: I've probably gained back all the weight I have to from my 2+ weeks of incessant eating.  Would really love for some reassurance and advice on this. Like I said, my next appointment is in 2 weeks so I have to hold on. ><  My previous meal plan. I proceeded to eat twice of what's on it, and went on to other stuff in the fridge ;(  B: 10 tablespoons oatmeal (the instant quaker kind, my fav) One pot full cream yoghurt (the individually packed kinds) One fruit (usually a really large banana)  S: Half a bar (50g) of Lindt 85% chocolate  L: Palm size portion of meat (chicken/fish) 3/4 bowl of rice Some veggies  S: One fruit  D: Same as lunch  S: One pot of full cream yoghurt, the rest of the Lindt chocolate bar (50g)   The current meal plan I'm on. I think it got bumped up by 1000 cal, really really nervous. >.< I tried not to calculate calories but it's just habit to estimate and I came up with about 2700  B: 12 tablespoons oatmeal 300ml whole milk 1 large fruit  S: Soy beancurd (approx 200 cal, I like to replace it with Fage total full fat)  L: One bowl of rice with 1 portion meat and 2 portion veggies OR noodles where when eating out I have to ask for extra ingredients  S: 1 bun with filling (curry bun, tuna bun, chocolate bun etc... My country loves these. Really high in cals.) OR  6 pieces of cream crackers OR 1 small pack of nuts OR 3 chocolate digestives (McVities) OR  1 pot full cream yoghurt OR  2 soyjoy bars (I actually tried these and they were yummy) OR Granola bars (I bought the Nature's Path Oat and Honey one... Haven't tried cos afraid >< 190 cals a pack)  D: One bowl rice, Palm size chicken/fish and 1/2 bowl veggies  S: 200ml whole milk   It's a lot isn't it. I skipped breakfast and I wasn't even hungry the whole day. And I felt really really bad and guilty about eating.   Please help! Sorry for the extremely long post, hope someone bothers.

I've  been  battling  bulimia for almost 18 years, started at 12 years and I'm  almost 30. I've  had a few good months where i eat healthy and exercise moderately but it never lasts and i end up bingeing and purging. I have it down to a science now. My cravings are out of control, i can't  stop once i start. I've  done water fasts to try to break the cravings but i can't  go long on those without  caving in to my cravings and desire to binge and purge. Gaining weight makes me severely  anxious, i think about  food and my weight all day every day. I'm  not overweight, but I'm  not underweight, I'm  skinny fat. My teeth are a mess, lots of cavities, and i just started getting kidney  stones  and pancreatitis  and gallbladder problems, stuff I've  never had an issue with before. It tells me my body is getting older and starting  to react to years of damage. I'm  a single mom of 2 and can't  afford the treatment I'm  sure i need, so I'm  reaching out for any kind of help for the first time ever . 
My mom is 65 years old and she has multiple problems, she has cholestrol and high Blood pressure which is under control with medicines, she has a problem of Irrtable bowel syndrome, and recently her health check up has revealed that she is having marginally high uric acid (6.2). She is now prescribed reduced non veg (fish and chicken) and no red meat. Can you please suggest a good weekly diet for her   
Okay, today I wrote a text, I am officially weight restored but i struggled against eating disorders for some years. I wrote a text about it and I don't if it might be helpful for some of you, it is really long, i am totally aware of it but if you have time, please read it.   At first, I thought about doing a text that would talk about what anorexia is like and then, I changed my mind because how I perceive this illness is not the same as everyone. I lived it and for me, it probable was different from her or him.  Then, I thought about writing in French, and after in English and looks like it won because words were more easily wrote. After all that, I thought about not writing anything at all. Why? Because I was ashamed and then, I realized that there was nothing to be ashamed of. I got sick, I fell down and I pushed my way through happy times and extremely hard times. And you know, it was hard as hell. I donât remember how many times I cried, how many times I wished I could be someone else, out of all these worries. Deep inside, nothing was okay; I was sad, desperate to find a glimpse of normality in my life. Everywhere I looked reminded me of who I had become. Everywhere I heard all these comments made about my weight, about how sick I looked, about how I should start eating. Every time, I remember telling them that I knew and that I would try. Countless promises broken, so many tears I shed because I wanted to succeed but at the same time, I didnât. I was fine with being where I was while being sick of it. Looking in the mirror was torture so everywhere there was some; I deflected my eyes or tried by any means possible to hide it because I couldnât stand who I was. This body of mine, I hated it more than anything, I couldnât see who I was, in these eyes, there werenât any part of me left. I wasnât living, I was surviving and it sounds cliché I know but when you live only to burn calories and count the ones you ate, youâre not living. I wasnât going out anymore, I didnât want to see people, I smiled but these smiles were insincere, behind them, I was breaking down. I fell apart so many times, after every âIâll get better, Iâll win this fightâ, some pieces of my mind were scattered. Because even though I did wish to get better, I didnât have any idea how. I was scared, I hated this tiny body of mine but I hated the fact of not knowing who I would become even more so I just stood there promising things I would never do. And even more than not doing anything and letting the fear take the better part of me, I hated all the suffering. Not mine because even if I did pass so many nights without sleep, even though I spent nights awake because of the pain, of the fear of dying, because I felt all alone in this big world it didnât bother me as much as the tears I made the people I hold dear shed. So many times they cried, so many times they tried to break the illusion in which I lived, the dream where I firmly believed I was fat. They yelled after me, they took away sports and watched me closely and I hated it. I wasnât free, I was being watched, I felt like I didnât have any control over my life and I only felt angriness around them. I was always in a bad mood, talking with me was almost impossible and I couldnât only run away from my reality with writing and music. I could stay there writing hours and hours because I needed to express my feelings, the ones I was never strong enough to say out loud. In these papers, I wrote a million âHelp meâ, in these papers, I took the pen to ask the universe if I would ever be better but in the end, I never got an answer because the world canât talk if you donât move forward. Time flew and when the day came and I went to the hospital for the first time, I saw how much my family loved me. Every time they could come, they would, it was hours and hours speaking to them on the phone and on my side, I tried. I ate and took weight and honestly, when I got discharged, I thought I could do it on my own. I really did but they knew I couldnât, I wasnât strong enough yet. But, they let me fall because they knew I needed to hit my own wall, they couldnât tell me what to do because I wouldnât have listened to them, they knew it, I only listened to myself. So, things got worse, way worse than before. Deep inside, I wasnât any better. My life was all about numbers and trying to find ways to not eat, it was lies after lies, tears after tears. Panic every day, and birthdays and Christmas were my worst nightmares. Me, who always loved Christmas, didnât want him to happen: too much food, too many calories.  I didnât see Christmas magic, all I saw was worthless time spending eating. It didnât take long before I went back to the hospital. I was so afraid because I disappointed every one that believed in me and I remember my sister asking me on the phone âWhy? Why did you let us down? If it wasnât going well, why didnât you say anything?â That day I answered âI donât knowâ because I didnât want to tell her the actual reason. Fact is, I just couldnât say anything, I was so ashamed of being weak, and I was so ashamed of losing against anorexia. I was so scared of telling her I couldnât handle being at home anymore, my home was the last place I wanted to be, I was scared of going back because I hated how I felt in there. I hated having all of my movements watched. I hated being in my own house because I felt like I wasnât welcomed there anymore, I felt like a burden. I know I wasnât but at that time, I needed to be by myself because I couldnât fight against my own mind and against my dad. I just couldnât so I gave up the one fight I couldnât win yet for the one I had to give everything I had.  Honestly, I wished I could write that after that, everything went for the best but truth is: it didnât. I ate, took some weight, got discharged and stayed at that point for months and months, I lost some, and I took some back. I wasnât getting any better physically neither was I getting worse but I wasnât getting better. The thought still crept in and I cried. Birthdays were horrible, cakes, pizzas, all these things I used to love, I hated them, I would think about dying before eating them because every time I ate some, I felt like dying. I felt fat, ugly and like I lost something. Everything I thought was true was actually false and I needed to re-learn about loving myself, about loving life. I needed to let go of this ideal I put up for myself and it was hard but, hey, I wasnât alone. I donât remember how many times my mom took me to Tim Hortons for me to eat something out of the ordinary. I donât remember how many times my sister took me out for breakfast and lunch. So many days spent shopping and having fun. I donât remember how many times my family had to make sacrifices so I could at least eat a little something. When my mom cooked fries, she would always cook rice for me because I couldnât handle fries. Every breakfast or lunch, my dad tried to push a little more food on my plate. I yelled at him so many times, he yelled at me so many times, he said so many things he shouldnât have and told me many times he gave up on my while tears were appearing in his eyes. He said those mean things but in the end, never gave up. My mom never stopped praying for me, I lost her trust more than once but she continued loving me.  All along, I had family with me, brothers would promised they would go out running with me again once I could, sisters to talk with and parents to love me. Nowadays, I can say it; I was a damn lucky girl and still am. If it wasnât for them, I wouldnât have started to get better. Slowly, I started eating and then, there was this one person who every day came to ask me how I was, if everything was okay. When I struggled, she listened and advised me. When I was wrong, she told me. With everyone else, they are the reason why I could get back on my feet, the reason why I didnât give up. It was a hell of a fight because I was fighting no one other than me, my mind was constantly arguing with my messed up logic and just putting some butter on my toast was a struggle.  Sounds pathetic right? But it wasnât, no fear must be called pathetic, none! Because it was a fear, it isnât anymore but once, it was and Iâm not scared neither do I feel lame about it. Itâs a fight I put up against myself and damn, looking at the mirror was tough. Sometimes, tears were falling down my face because I had taken 200g. TWO HUNDRED F****** GRAMS! And I was breaking down, telling myself how worthless I was. And then, I went out of the bathroom, went to school and smiled because at that time, I thought it was shameful to have an eating disorder so I stayed silent even though I wanted to talk about it. Sometimes, I was in class and I just wanted to cry, I was there trying to be like everyone else but I only dreamt of running in the bathroom so I could cry. But I never did. I couldnât bring myself to be in a vulnerable state, I was scared of them judging me. They all saw how I looked but never said anything; I didnât want them to know. Sometimes, I was waking at six in the morning and I only wished I didnât have to go to my classes. I didnât have any strength left, I felt so lonely in this crowd, and I just wanted to stay in bed doing nothing except listening to music while writing. But in the end, I always got up and did the same things as always. Step by step, I was regaining my weight, food that was scary before, wasnât so much anymore. Things got better for sure, Iâm not saying otherwise, what Iâm saying is, I didnât stay there waiting for it to happen. I ate. Even though I hated it, I ate and took one pound, then two, then three and in the end, I took thirty pounds. For every gram taken, I cried, I despised putting on weight, people told me I was getting prettier but I didnât care. What they saw, I couldnât see. But I did it anyways because I couldnât handle this selfishness of mine, this fear controlling my life, I just couldnât. I clearly saw what happened if I gave up fighting in the middle of the way, I wanted to see what would have happened if I didnât. It took time, three years of battling, three years of breaking down walls I built myself. And I can say that Iâm proud. Iâm proud of me, Iâm proud of the way I went through. It wasnât an easy road but I walked it, I survived and started living. Donât get me wrong, it is still not easy. Sometimes, the self-hatred is gigantic but I swallow up my pain and these feelings and move forward because feelings are feelings, they donât make your life.  I need to move because even if today is not a good day, tomorrow might be better. Sometimes, I still look in the mirror and point out all my imperfections but in the end, that body is mine and will always be, hating him wonât do me any better, I know that now. So, I get my sh*t together and I live. I try to see myself for who I really am not for what my wicked up logic tells me. Food is still a struggle but, hey, at least I eat. I can do what I like; I can jog again, go out for big walks and appreciate a big slice of cake when birthdays come.  Fear isnât manipulating me anymore. Truth is, even if battling against an eating disorder is almost unmanageable: THINGS GET BETTER! It takes time and sometimes, we lose our patience but I struggled and I cried, I gave up many times but in the end, I reached at point where my health is not in danger anymore and Iâm fine with it.  Iâm okay with whom I am today, I may not love myself but I get better every day and every day is not so sad anymore. So, an eating disorder isnât untreatable, you can recover from it, you just need to say it. You need to say it, itâs hard and you may feel weak but by yourself, you wonât go anywhere because that road, you are the only one who can walk but with no one to hold your hands while you walk, youâll have no one to get you up when youâll fall. So, I donât know who you are, I donât know youâre story, I donât give a damn whether you are a guy or a girl and if youâre 15, 16,10 or 9 years old, I just want you to know, you can get better. So, tell someone if you need help, if youâre sad or if you see how much you struggle around food. It doesnât matter if youâre overweight or normal sized, an eating disorder isnât defined by weight.  Just say it before it is too late. There is nothing to be ashamed of, NOTHING. Life is life and like my favorite saying goes âSh*t happensâ so gets it together and move forward. Life has so much more to offer than your disorder.  
Hello, Im a 16 year old girl and 49kg, 164cm. Recently ( 2 months) I relapsed and began eating about 500 calories and working out alot. I really want to recover but dont want to gain weight because im not underweight . How can I increase my intake without gaining? and with what foods? ( i usually eat yogurt for breakfast and the rest of my meals are leafy greens) 
(17 female) im 5ft4 and weigh 56kg. Im aware that according to the BMI scale that im 'normal' weight but i couldn't be unhappier.  I started off as 60kg in january and from here starting eating only healthy foods and exercising quiet frequently and i didnt loose any weight.  All of a sudden people started commenting on my weight loss and then people started noticing i had been eating less. because of this i felt like i should continue to eat less and had been counting every calorie and been obsessed with my weight and terrified of weight gain.  Lately, i have been doing very little exericise. When i do do exercise its something small to try and make myself feel better for an extra slice of toast or something. Somedays i restrict me calorie intake so much (500) thinking im back on track but the next day i completely binge eat. It could be anything up to 3500 calories where the majority is fatty foods. I feel so sick but i continue to eat, i then start sweating, over heating, get headaches and feel generally ill. this doesnt stop me though, i will keep eating. I try to make myself sick to feel better but i cant, it doesnt work.   Some days i look in the mirror and am kind of happy, a few hours later i look in it again and just cry in disgust. It's stressing me out!! I dont know if i have a disorder or if im just a regular teenage girl obsessed with their apperance.   Please help me

I am an endomorph and despise my shapely legs. The rest of my body I am trying to tone up and slim down but my legs don't respond and it's depressing me. The feeling of fat on my body is starting to make me feel physically sick and I feel like I'm pushing myself too much when I exercise as I do it until I go lightheaded. I'm afraid I'll develop anorexia or bulimia if I carry on like this. I already see myself as fatter than I already am. I eat well (i.e. No carbs or sugar and rarely drink alcohol), I exercise daily. What should I do to slim my legs down without becoming ill? 
I'm in recovery and my family is very supportive but I feel lonely becssue I have no friends, no one to talk to. Anyone there to talk or relate? 
Hi, I have been bulimic for 8 years. I'm 25 years old. I'm sick & tired of this eating disorder ruining my life but trying to beat it is hopeless & impossible! I have no one I can talk to about it which is adding to my depression. I lead a normal life have a great job and great family/friends but I am suffering in silence. Would be nice to have a buddy to talk to & support each other who understands what I'm going through. Don't know how much longer I can cope. 
Hi All,  I've been a member of this forum for a little while now and hopefully have helped some of you all a little bit with little pieces of information I've learned in my own journey.  I thought it might help to tell me own story in order to help some of you who are anxious about seeking help, in the midst of starting treatment, or just out of treatment and experience relapses (and everything in between.  I am 26. My issues with self esteem and body image began at age 11. I struggled to fit in at school and had 1 friend. I was laughed at because of my last name. I had also started my periods before starting secondary school and as a result was more curvatious than a lot of my pre-adolescent classmates. In my eyes I was fat and they were thin. I had spots (which occured at my time of the month) they didn't have these issues. I was friendless they were popular. They had boyfriends and I didn't.  Everyone knew I had a crush on a guy, and one day he confronted me on it. He decided to tell me that he'd sooner go out with a guy than someone who was as fat and ugly as me.   It was this point I decided to do something about my weight (note...I wasn't actually overweight, but I felt it.) The consequence was a sense of body dysmorphia where I was comparing myself, a woman to child like figures. I didn't know this at the time of course.  I didn't tell anyone, because I didn't want my mum to know I was upset, and I didn't want her to stop me from what I was doing (and I knew she would). So I would avoid food during the day and eat normally with my family in the evening. I used to try and make myself sick, but I never figured out how to do this.  When you deprive your body of energy through the day it tries to source energy from other means, and as a result I ended up going on binge episodes particularly when I got home from school. Emotionally I was in agony. I wasn't losing any weight, I couldn't control what was going on, and I was actually getting larger. (I also think the medication I was on at the time didn't help...but that's a side issue. I was on a drug for my epilepsy which I had suddenly developed). I started feeling really depressed, had suicidal thoughts, lost concentration and had very limited motivation.  Still I didn't seek help.  (and they say school days are meant to be the best of your life).  I did manage to talk to my parents about my unhappiness at school, and when I reached the start of year 10, I started a new school. They were still none the wiser about my eating disorder. The new school would have been brilliant but for the fact I never confronted the underlying eating issues. I was also accompanied with a new medication for my epilepsy (I'd been on the wrong drug before) which was an appetite suppressant aswell. Needless to say I conveniently forgot to tell the epilepsy consultant that I had eating problems, else I'd probably never been put on this drug.  I also found I was managing to navigate my meals much better, with GCSEs coming up, so my eating disorder still was a case of binge / starve, but I found myself being increasingly more restrictive, right up to the point when I had starved myself for 3 weeks during a residential music course and subsequent tour to Italy, and ended up collapsing in the middle of a piazza in Rome. (I convinced the organisers that I was inebriated - drunk) and my parents were none the wiser. I WISH at that stage someone had intervened, as by this stage my GP knew, a couple of teachers knew and a friend at church knew, all keeping my confidence because it apparently wasn't a physical risk.  A few months later (in my A level year), I finally gave in, with several ultimatums from the various personel above, and told my parents. I've said before, it's a horrible experience, really painful, but once it's done everything gets better, and the best thing is you have them on your team helping you all the way. Within a week I had a referral for a consultant at the Priory (as we had health insurance), and then following the severity of my condition, I was admitted inpatient, and spent the last months of my school years in hospital. I missed all the leavers events, and only returned to school to do my A levels (though I doubt I'd have been allowed if I hadn't started eating again when I did).  I found hospital strict, regimented, extremely boring at times and frustrating. There were aspects of the meal plans that really annoyed me, because when I ate "normally" I didn't eat desserts every day. I also remember it feeling very hazy mostly because I was so poorly. However, I did make some very good friends who I really count on at times that have been difficult since then.  I'm a fighter and always have been. I was determined to sit my A levels (and I did). I was determined to go to my first choice university, and I got the grades for this....somehow! I was also determined to stick to my plan and go on my gap year to Ghana. Whilst this has been the biggest inspirational point in my life, it was perhaps too early in my recovery and created a significant hurdle which I am now still trying to overcome.  Because I was so determined, I ended up discharging myself early...I was 18 and not a physical risk...although my consultant did at the time say I hadn't finished the programme (she was of course right). In Ghana, I spent two months eating a lot of carbohydrates. Food was very basic, and I had a lot of guilt associated with finishing what was on the plate, as that was what I'd been told in hospital, however due to the hospitality portion sizes were enormous.  As soon as I came home I started restricting on the carbs, because I couldn't handle my weight gain (which was actually the weight I should be...I just wasn't used to it.) I had a full blown relapse, but because I was 18 now, I wasn't eligible for my Dad's health insurance. Instead we paid for private outpatient support at the Priory again. I was lucky to have the support of a therapist, a nurse to monitor my dietitic input and my excellent consultant, but I still never really conquered the carb phobia.  I did however manage to get through university thanks to a number of brilliant events such as bonding with an amazing social group, and meeting a lovely boyfriend very early on which instilled a confidence in me that I hadn't had prior to this.  The plan was to get support through the NHS in Manchester, but confused addresses, lengthy referrals and changes in addresses meant that by the time I actually received my referral it was in my final year and it seemed pointless to follow through with the treatment. This gap in treatment though had let a lot of disordered eating patterns develop and whilst life was stable at this point, mentally I wasn't equipped for when life did get rocky.  And in 2012 it did. Everything seemed to happen at once. My parents moved out of our family home, I had to find my feet socially at home in London, I had a new job which was extremely stressful, I experienced the pitfalls of renting in London. Very quickly everything escalated, and I went to my GP for a referral. I didn't get an assessment until the following year, and the result from the assessment was my condition wasn't deemed serious enough to warrant support from the specialist eating disorders service. A few months later, I had got so seriously unwell I was in A & E (still no help from mental health services), but my parents did decide to support me privately. In 2014, my job role was made redundant, I had had issues in the flat I was staying in and had had to move quickly into a new one (later in the year I had further issues of incompetant landlords), the new job I got 4 months later I was bullied by my boss, I also experienced the passing of my Grandma (less sudden as she was 94) and the sudden death of a close family friend.  In 2014, I quit the job where I was bullied...so two changes of jobs in one year. However all this while I was also trying to recovery from a serious relapse with my eating disorder.  Thankfully, not only had I been assigned a brilliant therapist (she was actually a trainee, as I got a cheaper rate that way), but by far the best I have ever worked with. I also got an amazing dietitian who I saw fortnightly. The therapist tackled my therapy from a DBT approach, which was different to the interpersonal therapy I'd had before, and I found this extremely helpful given the issues I'd been experiencing. My dietitian also had a background in CBT, so we combined methods in confronting my anxiety. I also found this time round I was a lot more honest about the challenges I'd been experiencing...e.g. this was the first time I was honest about the bingeing. I thought it was a weakness in an anorexic to binge. He explained why it happened. We talked about many of the psychological feelings associated with fullness and did a lot of food education, including a bit of a eureka moment when I discovered something I perhaps should have known, but the location of the stomach. So when you feel full and you point to your "stomach" you are actually pointing to your intestines. Your stomach is below your heart. Food in your stomach won't have reached your intestines after eating a large meal as it takes several hours.   I was discharged in March, and since then I've had a bit of a bumpy ride. I didn't want to finish so soon, as in the ideal world I'd have liked to have been supported with my dietitian up to maintaining at my target weight. The reason it stopped was due to my therapist qualifying (my dietitian wouldn't work with me if I didn't have a therapist as well). There have been occasions where I have returned to tactics which are unhealthy to combat my anxiety for a few days. And then after I get on track. The real battle that is going on is that I have an issue with seeing my weight creeping up when I haven't deliberately put myself on a weight gain plan. I'm not ready yet to gain the weight I need to get to my target weight, but know I need to and soon. At the moment I'm working on carbs. In a month and a half, I'm going back to Rome, and I'm excited to try a pizza meal and pasta meal. I'm building up to this, and have felt that if I'm allowing myself to do this, I'm allowed to start sport again. Last week for the first time in ages I went back to gymnastics, and it was the best feeling ever (except after when my legs killed...but it was a happy pain).  2015 in contrast to 2014 has been significantly better. My manager at work is so supportive in my eating disorder recovery, and is just amazing. I have a flat which is lovely, and great flatmates, and am getting a lot more balanced as a whole.  I wanted to share my journey, because when I left hospital I thought that was it, I'd be better. Increasingly over time I have got more frustrated when I haven't been better, or the thoughts haven't magically gone away, or there isn't a clear answer as to why my eating disorder behaviours keep creeping in.  As you can see, sometimes you'll have a 2014, and you have to work extremely hard to avoid your eating disorder taking over. Other times you'll have a year more like 2015, and it's a bit more of a breeze. Planning is so key to staying on track.  Yes, you'll struggle, but I wanted to share this because it is possible to get there.  Every day is a journey and adventure. 
Im scared that if i start to put weight back on to be a healthy wweight my freinds will not like me anymore. 
My mum is taking me to the doctors for an 'eating disorder'. I do skip meals and try to eat as little calories as possible but the thing is, I put loads of weight on during exams. This summer I started trying to loose it and now she is going too far saying it's an eating disorder. Now I'm embarrassed because I'm around 5'4/5 and I weigh about 8 stone. I look a bit chubby in all honesty, and sometimes I binge. Other days I starve or eat as little as possible. I have tried to make myself sick but it doesn't usually work. I don't really know what they will do because by no means am I underweight or in any danger, I'm clinically a healthy weight, my BMI is healthy, I don't abuse laxatives etc. it's not a proper eating disorder, other people truly suffer. I'm embarrassed to get help. What will they do? 
I stopped having my period last year and have not gained it back yet. This guy and me however have gotten to the stage of being ready to have sex however can I because I havnt restarted periods? My mum said I can't buy I don't know if that's just her way or protecting me? What would happen if I did have sex with him? Please help  
Ive never admitted to having a problem with food, i kept it as not a problem, but my weights plummeted, i find it difficult to do certain tasks. I count every single calorie, i stop my body from having the nutrients it wants. So i asked for help. But im scared, its been months of me trying to fight the voices in my head. WIll it ever go away? I am so frustrated with myself that ive let my mind take over my whole life, this stupid pathetic fantasy of being so thin, you can snap, i want that? apparently. I want it all to go away. But i just cant see that happening any day soon. Everyone just says the same thing, 'just eat, tis not difficult' i would give anything in the world for it to be that easy. I just need someone else who understands, help me   
Hi, i'm 17 and I think I have had an eating disorder my entire life, I'm not sure if it can be classed as an eating disorder as I've never told a doctor about it before, and the only people who know about it are my close family. I find it really embarrassing to talk about and despite the fact that i'm actually fairly healthy (I weigh 7.5 stone which is the ideal weight for my height, and as far as I know i'm healthy), it is starting to worry me. When I was 2 or 3 years old, I would eat anything, I wasn't fussed at all, and then suddenly I just stopped. I don't know why, I just did. Now all I eat is junk food, the only vegetable i'll eat is lettuce and I rarely touch a fruit unless it's in the form of juice. The only meat I eat is chicken breast, so every night I tend to eat chicken or pizza with chips, or something a long those lines. Every night. I know, it's not healthy and I hate myself for it. But I get tearful when someone asks me to try something new and it's just pathetic. I can't go out for meals with my friends and I just can't talk to anyone about it. I don't know if there is anyone in a similar condition to me but it's starting to rule my life and I need advice.  
I have had annorexia for 3 years now and lost my periods 2 years ago. Will i ever regain my periods or be able to have chidlren? I have stopped losing weight and am maintaing. 
So I'm now 18, female and fully weight restored after struggling with disordered eating and restricting and exercise addiction. After my mother passing away at the end of 2011 I began to lose weight, initially from stress and trauma but then on purpose as a way of coping, I would eat about 700 calories per day give or take and exercise as much as I could. I'm 5ft 7 and dropped to to 7 1/2 stone down from just over 11, my lowest weight occurred exactly one year ago, since then (So December 2012 onwards) I decided by myself that I wanted to recover and I saw a doctor who told me I needed to gain weight as I had lost my menstrual cycle and was underweight... I didn't see any eating disorder professionals though. I did see a dietitian who helped me with meal and snack ideas and told me how much I really needed to be eating, so I ate the nourishing diet, and still am! I eat really healthy and balanced and now have a healthy bmi of 20 and exercise in moderation BUT 12 months later my hair is still thinning like CRAZY! It's making me feel so down and now want to leave the house, I hardly have any hair left...I'm considering getting a wig. I never go out without a hat. I've had blood tests and my diet isn't deficient in anything, I'm not stressed about anything EXCEPT THE HAIR, my thyroid and liver have been checked and are fine too and my menstrual cycle returned this summer as well. Will it ever stop falling out and thicken up? I take vitamins B complex, Iron, Calcium + vitamin D too.  I'm an 18 year old girl, I just need my hair!   
I have a friend that has an eating disorder. I try to make her comfortable whenever we hangout. If we eat she always decides what we have so she's comfortable eating. I found out she gets upset whenever we have food when we hangout. I'm trying to be a good friend, but also make sure she doesn't get sick by not eating. What can I do to become a better friend for her? I want to help her do well, but she hates me in a way for promoting her wellness 
I lost a lot of weight 1.5 years ago on the raw food diet, and was hospitalized for my low heart rate (44bpm resting) and low weight (14 years old, 80 lbs, 5'2". Now I'm pretty much back at that same weight and heart rate, and am about to be hospitalized. However, I did some research, and in the raw vegan community many people say that the standards for what is a "healthy" weight are totally messed up! What's considered a healthy weight by doctors is actually overweight! I feel like I'm being forced to gain weight that I don't need! Please help! And another thing... the whole "menstruation" thing... I heard that it's totally unnatural for women to menstruate! And even if it is natural, maybe it's just not "my time" yet...but the doctors say it's because of low weight...but I'm not so sure! 
Every time I see food on the stove or in the lunch line I don't feel like I can eat it because it just doesn't look appealing. A family member insisted that I eat some Chinese food they bought last night and I made a bowl and I couldn't eat all of it and I didn't even get a lot of it. I tried to eat more of it but it made me really uncomfortable and I got really upset over it so I stopped and put it in the fridge. Before last night I hadn't eaten anything 3 days prior. I'm not sure why I don't seem to be able to enjoy food even when I know I need it. 
To anyone out there who is strugggling with any ED please seek help, i wish i had sooner. Ive struggled with my relationship with food since i was 18 and im now 50, im supposedly in recovery and have just spent 2 months in ED unit then previous to this five stays in hospital from Psychiatric to medical. My BMI is currently 15.6 and finding each day a chore, i only feel slightly better if the scales tell me ive lost, i feel depressed all the time. I live a lonely life as i dont have a good network of friends and family, i try to hide it from my 18yr old son as he worries. Im not really sure what i want to say i guess just that anyone else out there seek help earlier, go to your doctor tell a friend but dont suffer alone. 
Hi everyone,  My question is regarding the effects off malnutrition, during male puberty on the development of the body( especially secondary sex charasteristics).  My case: I developped a eating disorder at the age of 12-13 which continued on and off til the age of 15-16, during that time I also didnt exersize much.   Right now I am 21 and am noticing that I still have a very childish face(very small chin/jaw), not so broad shoulders and a small chest. Could this be due to the fact that my body was/(is still??) unable to produce the normal amount of testosteron??  I did go trough puberty I think, because I do have a lower voice, and I am getting more and more facial hair, also I did get taller.    Did I screw up my development(facial bonestructure, shoulders, chest)? If yes, is there still something I can do, to make up for it(like taking hormones or something)?  Sorry if my english is bad, I am not a native speaker.  
Im 16 and ive been recovering from anorexia since about 10/11 months ago, bit I had my school prom a few days ago and things have started getting alot worse since then, it made me feel worse about myself and i already hate every inch of myself, I've been hardly eating and just wanting to lose weight all over again and get back to about 6 stone I'm struggling with food really bad and its just so much stress and anorexia has ruined my GCSES, and is putting a strain on my relationship with my bf, but I just want to get back to a normal person where eating food isn't a chour  is there any way I can recover quickly cuz everything's just gone back down hill...  
Hey all im 22 and for years ive suffer with anorexia nervosa alongside anxiety ive tried many ways to gain weight but i seem to lose it just as fast so i was wondering what other treatments are there? I was thinking of asking my doctor if i could have a 'NG Tube' fitted through my nose to help me get the kick start i need but im curious if you have to be a specific weight to obtain the treatment as i cant seem to find any information online  
Is there anyone around the ages of 14-18 that are going through an eating disorder? i just wondered if there was anyone I could relate to or talk to around my age, im 16  
Hi, has someone heard about treatments of bacteriophages? It seems they kill the pseudomonas..... 
Hey everyone! I'm new here, and I've been suffering from anorexia for a few years now and have been in recovery since the beginning of March.  I've gained to a bmi of 15.6, but now I feel like there's nothing wrong with that and I no longer need to be in treatment.  Though I feel really awful all of the time with I'm sick of and want it to change, and I know I need to gain weight for that to happen.  I decided before that If I was To decide I couldn't deal with recovery that I wouldn't let myself go back down the spiral I'd just end my life, as I cannot live like that anymore, and right now I just feel like I'm not sick ebough and anorexia is how my life must be, and if that's the case then I don't want it.  But commiting suicide is not what I want to do as it would destroy my friends and family.  I'm imagining pretty much everyone hits this place during recovery, how do you carry on? Please tell me it gets easier...? 
Two weeks ago I was discharged from the hospital due to low heart rate and low weight.  People say that I'm too skinny -- the doctors, my family, even some friends -- but my perception of my body changes all the time.  Like sometimes I look in the mirror and think that I am too skinny, but five minutes later I might be wearing different clothes or something and I'll think I look completely fine!  I know that distorted body image is when extremely underweight people see themselves as overweight, but I just see myself as normal-looking, not overweight.  Has anyone experienced something similar?  Sometimes I think that maybe my thinking that I look normal is due to distorted body image, but other times I think that maybe I really am normal, and people are just making a big deal out of nothing.  I mean, my mom is the one who comments on my body the most, but of course she's bound to do that -- because she's my mom!  Some people say I look totally normal - not even a little bit too skinny.  So I'm confused.    And if I do have distorted body image...is there a physiological reason for that?  Are there certain connections in my brain that just aren't working?  Thanks. 
Hello, I have a problem with my brother. He doesn't eat nothing. He wants to, but he doesn't like anything except french fries, meat and cakes. When he was a child, he used to have a very balanced diet but now, he is impossible! It's really bad for his health but there is nothing to do: he just doesn't want to eat a vegetable or a fruit, rice, fish or even pasta! As he can't eat always french fries and meat, he eats hardly nothing. Do you think that seeing a nutritionist would help him? 
I haven't been on this site in a while but have been in recovery for 7 months now it is difficult to maintain but I'm doing well. I've  Grown 3 inches since my recovery and starting to like food again ð I hope everyone who helped me is doing well, I hope people manage to recover from the terror of eating disorders 
Hiya guys,   For a while now I've been struggling to eat. I think it's been about 6 months. I won't eat any cooked food and will only eat choclates and sweets! I spend a massive portion of my time in the bathroom trying to get the food I do manage to eat out my system. I am really emotional lately aswell and I don't know why?!   Can anyone give me any insight?! 
Hi, I've been in recovery for quite a while now and have gained a fair amount of weight. I am now almost at a healthy weight for my age and height.  I was just wondering, is there anyone in the same boat that wants to share their experience and maybe give each other some good advice  
I've been restricting what I eat and on school days I'd only eat dinner with my family because I wouldn't want to worry them but I'd skip that if possible. I lie and say I'm going to friends houses for meals when actually I just walk around for hours just so I can skip meals. I've lost 15 lbs but on days when I have to eat normally my weight increases by around 2 or 3 pounds but I'm still eating less calories then I need so I don't understand why this happens. I am not underweight, but I want to stop having this obsession with food and the horrible guilt I feel whenever I eat. I'm too scared to eat normally and recover though because I know I'll gain weight and if I'm a healthy weight now I don't want that to happen. Any advice? 
i had anorexia last year but I've gone the other way now and keep binging. I have been binging for about 5 months and gained 16kg so I'm now overweight. I am fine in the morning and afternoon but soon as night comes, I'll eat the whole kitchen!   It is wrecking my body image and self esteem which were already pretty low. I feel ashamed and embarrassed to be seen cause I feel so fat. I hate wearing tight clothing cause I feel like their gonna  explode because I'm so fat. I've tried losing weight but then as soon as i restrict my diet I'll binge more. Aaaaah!!. Help please, anything that has stopped you binging would be very very appreciated. 
Can we talk about a healthy weight for a 14 year old who's 5'5?  And can I have a support buddie to talk to?

I am in the start of recovery from an eating disorder  but I feel my self falling back in to my old way and Im scared to ask my family for help . I feel like I have let them down they was happy and though I was getting someone where .  
Okay.  Where shall I begin.  I am a fifteen year old girl.  About two years ago, I got introduced to the raw vegan diet.  At first, I was innocently experimenting with it, but after a while I became more and more strict on this diet and created more and more rules.  I moved into fruitarianism, and though my weight was dropping, I was convinced that this was healthy weight loss.  My mom put me in touch with a raw food nutritionist to try to gain some weight back, but that didnât work because I had no intention of doing so.  Finally, my school counselor recommended to my mom to take me to an eating disorder clinic for an evaluation.  With a resting heart rate of 44, I was hospitalized on the spot (sent to an eating disorder comprehensive care unit).  After I left that horrible hospital, I was supposed to continue ânutritional rehabilitation,â but I did no such thing and soon lost all the weight that I gained in the hospital.    So I got sent to an eating disorder clinic, where I went for partial care treatment and then inpatient treatment for a month.  I was supposed to continue going there, but my mom and I had planned to move to Bali that summer, so my mom took me out of the program before I was ârecoveredâ and hoped for me to continue gaining weight in Bali.  During the first few months in Bali, I was super motivated to gain weight.  Also, my school wasnât allowing me to do sports until I did gain some, so that also motivated me.  I was having frequent hunger signals and was happy to respond to them.    Then, at the beginning of 2015, seeing that I had gained some weight on my own, my school allowed me to do sports.  So I lost my motivation to gain weight, started exercising every day, and skipped meals.  So I lost weight.    Now Iâm back to the same weight that I was when I was hospitalized the first time.  I weigh 80 pounds and have a height of 5â2â.  Seeing that I lost weight, my school said that I canât return to school until I get treatment.  So my mom got tickets to go back to America for me to go to the hospital and then do an intensive partial hospitalization program over the summer.    But hereâs the thing.  I donât actually have an eating disorder.  I never did.  The reason I skipped meals and lost weight after I was allowed to do sports was because everyone convinced me into behaving like I have an eating disorder.  For the past year, my mom, doctors, and all sorts of people have been telling me that I have an eating disorder, and so finally they managed to convince me into behaving like I do have one.    But now I have changed.  I have recognized that I have control over my thoughts and that I choose whether I have this âEDâ or not.  And I am prepared to gain weight on my own.  I eat A LOT more than people think.  I get frequent hunger signals and eat whenever Iâm hungry (about 2000 cals/day), but since Iâve been maintaining weight this way, Iâm prepared to eat more to gain weight.  We were supposed to fly to America today, but I rode away on my bike and didnât come home until I was sure we would miss the flight, which we did.  This is because I know I donât need treatment.  I can do it on my own.  Even though I tried to gain weight and failed before.  This time itâs gonna work.    But my mom doesnât think so.  She doesnât trust me.  And she wants to force me into treatment.  But I donât have an eating disorder!  I can recover weight on my own!  Please help. 
I know I can't be diagnosed through this, but I'm starting to wonder. All I think about is losing weight, I restrict myself all the time- consuming between 0-500 calories, I take 3-4 laxatives a day and exercise as much as I can... 
For many years I have had based my happiness and self worth on my size, I have made myself sick, I have limited my food intake whilst all the time exercising manically.  All weight lost usually returns and some.  I have really struggled with the latest weight gain as someone very close to me passed away and I feel like giving up.  My support system has gone, there is no one to tell me to not be silly eat, or go out or letâs go out.  I have been exercising manically and as a reward for exercise have taken in way too many calories, so I am steadily growing and I canât see an end to this circle.  I have limited throwing up to when I have really over indulged which is usually once a week but the constant over eating is daily.  I am just so confused and don't know what to do, please if anyone can offer some advice.  Thanks  
Hi well I'm 22 and have the problem of feeling fat constantly... I'm always being told that I've lost loads of weight but I still feel the same weight and feel like I look the same weight every time I look in the mirror I starting this being sick all the time after I ate... After my boyfriend would call me fat constantly and that's what has triggered it off now every time I look in the mirror I just feel fat and disgusting .. And when I eat anything I feel fat and that's when I go back to the toilet and make myself sick again ? Just wondering does this feeling fat thing ever go I don't wanna damage my body ... But it depresses me to constantly feel this about myself every day  
Hi, Im 16, from the Isle of Man. So, around 18 months ago I was border line anorexic, 39kg at 14 and 5"6 ish. My mum noticed what was going on eventually, and told my pediatrician. And it went from there really. Pediatricians, counsellors, dieticians.. Im now around 50kg, last time I was weighed. I got discharged from my dietician a few months ago, because she thought I was at an okay weight. But recently, I've been getting up late and missing breakfast and basically just not making the effort I should really. Maybe because of a boy being a but of a d*ck and messing with my feelings.. Its not that I dont eat, because I do. But my parents keep nagging at me and saying Im looking too thin and that they've seen "more fat on a chip". Personally, I think now that I am 16 it should really be my decision what weight I am. I get that they are worried, but I just want to be the weight I want. But i cant. I do want to gain weight and be able to wear a bikini, and not get the mickey take out of me for my small boylike frame. But, I just find it hard. Any advice or anything would be much appreciated  thank youu   
I have recently been diagnosed with anorexia, I feel very depressed and I don't have any form of motivation. I feel I get irritated very easy and I feel I am distant with my friends and family, I often cry and I am really hating myself at the moment. I am not the skeleton anorexics are often viewed as so I feel stupid telling people that the hippo that I am could possibly be classed as such thing. I have recently turned to laxatives and I love the fast results, not so much the stomach pain. I feel I will never be satisfied and I often get suicidal thoughts. I am not even bothered if I get cured or not I just want my family to stop worrying- certainly my mom who I was once very close to. 
Hello, I am wondering whether I have an eating disorder? I am currently diagnosed as having Borderline Personality Disorder with Psychosis.  I go through stages of starving myself, then bingeing, then repeating for quite a while, but now I have started to take 10 laxatives in the morning before breakfast, then 10 laxatives before eating dinner, then 10+ laxatives before bed. I am starting to get worried about what this could do to my body, but I can't seem to stop myself from taking them.  Can anyone help? 
This will probably be the most ignorant question ever, but I really need some help understanding. All I know is that my eating patterns are definitely not normal or healthy.  I have some days where I'll snack and eat normally, but I'll hate myself afterwards. And some days where I absolutley refuse to eat, even to the point where i'm cold and tred I just drink tea/water. For some reason I love feeling empty, I feel lighter. I need to lose weight.  However, I haven't lost any weight. I don't meet the criteria for anorexia or bulimia. I tried purging once, but I only gagged until my eyes watered and I saw stars. But nothing came up and I felt worse.  I know this isn't normal, I also have severe health anxiety which messes with my appetite sometimes. But usually I'm making a concous decision not to eat to lose weight, but I haven't lost any weight so I don't think what I have counts as some sorm of eating disorder. Any thoughts or advce on this?  I'm so sorry this is a silly question, I don't articulate very well. 
I am recovering from anorexia and am under i deititan/nutrtionalist. In order for me to get back to a normal healthy weight i need to put on weight but i am scared that when i get back to a healthy BMI will i be able to stop putting the weight on? 
Hi I'm in recovery and lately I've been eating a hell of a lot more since I starts my recovery. When I started I ate 2000 calories and now I'm eating 3000-4000, I'm not Hungary but my mind just tells me to eat till a point I'm nearly sick. Also, when I'm back to normal, how will I eat more healthily, is it easier or hard to cut back down  Whilst in recovery I have gotten my old healthy looks back big I also need to add a few pounds, will it affect my looks and appearance eg bring my stomach out more and putting a bit more fat on my face   During recovery, to get my calories I have ate an awful amount of sweets because I have deprived myself of them for so long, is that good or bad  What is the ideal weight for someone who is 15 and 163cm tall 
Hi all   i've never posted on this group before, but I think i have bulimia. i got disagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder a few months ago. ive always been obsessed with my weight, i weigh myself every day. i lost about 3 stone last year and was SO healthy, i was so tonned and ate really healthy foods, had a personal trainer, was 5'4 and just under 10 stone so i was quite healthy. im a 21 year old female and since ive had anxiety, i cant stop making myself sick. before it would be maybe once a week if i had a big meal and felt uncomftorble, but recently its 3 times a day, after every meal. i know how bad this is for my body, so why am i doing  it? why cant i stop ? i hate making myself sick, it hurts, and i feel weak after. but honestly i just cant stop no matter how hard i try? i havent told anyone about it because i am just so embarassed by it. i keep it all a secret. i literally stare at my body for hours and weigh myself every half an hour. why am i so obsessed with my weight? i want to get help, i really do, but cant talk to anyone about it. if i know that making myself sick is basically killing me, and i know its so unhealthy for me, why do i keep doing it? i really dont feel in control anymore, i dont know whats happening to me, can anyone relate or help? xxx 
I'm 16 I've been anarexic for almost a year because Ive always saw myself fat when I was actually a decent weight for my age. In the first four months when this began I lost a little over 20 pounds then my family started to notice so my mom gave me my servings at breakfest and dinner and made sure I ate it all I've been gaining more weight now by eating all the right foods and yet I still look super skinny to my friends even sometimes me but I still see my self not skinny enough. But I guess my question is how do I still look skinny when I'm gaining my weight back  
I wonder if anyone can give me some support as I have no-one to share my fears with.  My beautiful and intelligent daughter started cutting out cakes, biscuits, etc, at the age of 15.  She was a size 14, but some girls at school said she was fat.  She is now almost 38 and eats barely anything.  She doesn't acknowledge her anorexia - she is also bulimic, and is currently working as an academic in Bosnia.     I have just spent a week out in Bosnia with her and can see she has lost weight since I last saw her at Christmas.  She is extremely thin though she thinks she is fat and is still desperately trying to lose weight from her legs.  She won't eat anything remotely fattening - she is living on apples, yellow peppers and tomatoes.  She will drink a cup of hot milk in the mornings.    I am so afraid that something is going to happen to her.  Amazingly, she seems well in herself and never gets colds or coughs.  She has also suffered thinning of her hair and hair loss, which she has been told is genetic.  I don't believe it is genetic at all, but due to her diet.  As soon as I mention food and what she eats, she doesn't want to know.  She is 5'7 and a size 6.  I have no-one to discuss my fears with.  If anyone is able to offer any help to me, I would be extremely grateful.   
I've been battling bulimia for around 3 and a half years now. I've always been overweight, always been the 'fat' friend. When I first purged I felt good. The first few weeks was when I noticed the biggest difference. All my friends kept telling me how skinny I was looking and it made me feel amazing!! I tried not eating but i couldn't help binging the odd sweet treat. I hated myself so much that anything I ate I began purging. It went from once every so often after a 'bad' meal or 'sweet treat' to after every single thing I ate. Few months went by and I began to feel really ill. My skin got bad rashes around my eyes, my teeth started feeling sensitive, I had cuts on my knuckles from my teeth, I was constantly exhausted but the worst thing was when I binged and suddenly I couldn't be sick. I physically couldn't throw anything up. My stomach churned, I wretched, my eyes watered but nothing would come up. All the weight I supposedly lost soon all piled back on and I was feeling worse than ever. Now not only did I feel majorly fat but I felt extremely unwell yet I still couldn't stop myself being sick. However it only seemed to work with breaks of purging inbetween. Several years later and I'm still battling with my weight and my bulimia and severe depression. Except now I've been diagnosed with barretts oesophagus and I've been seeing specialists over stomach problems. Most people would think having these issues would wake me up and stop turning to locking myself in the bathroom with a pint of water after 'over indulging' but no. I love food. I hate being fat. And I just can't get myself out of this awful cycle. Currently I've never felt worse about myself. I've lost all interest in sex which is causing strain on my relationship but the thought of me getting naked makes me feel sick. I put myself off. I'm so lost in binging and purging I don't really see a way out. I want to stop. I want to just lead a healthy life, exercise, good food. I want it. I'm forever told I'm a 'curvy' girl and I should accept it and be happy. I don't  want to be happy with that! I want to be one of the sexy girls who aren't disgusted when they get changed or shower. Who don't dread summer because flesh has to be shown! I want it so badly I've practically killed my insides. I know I need to stop, I just don't know how. 
Im 15, ive been recovering from anorexia for 7 months now I want to get to a normal weight but now more and more people are telling me im improving a bit, its good to know but its making me feel fat and want to lose weight and drop to 6 stone again, even when they say your improving but still too thin but i still want to be thinner...! I hate food and recovery is so hard, is it normal in recovery to want to cry and lose weight when you see the scale numbers go up a few and people tell you your getting bigger? Just want to be rid of anorexia already  
so im crazy obssesed over my weight ive been overweight since having a child. i went down to 133 finally close to my pre pregnancy weight when i lost my job and started binge eating like crazy and went up to 145 almost immediately. i was literally stress eating . i have now been feeling so bad and dissapointed that i havent ate for 4 days i been doing crazy exercise and been taking laxatives heres the problem. i have had no bowel movements in these 4 days and i have only dropped 3 pounds. i dont understand its as if my body is fighting to not lose weight. ive had much success with my add medicine helping me out to supresss appetite in the past but now i just dont know what going on im desperate. i just feel ive been working so hard and no results im afraid of binge eating again. and i just cant deal with myself afterwards. i dont think i have an illness i just want to be at my prepregnancy weight so bad it hurts. 
can someone chat and help me see the benefits of recovering? please. 
Im a male who has been bulimic for 11 years and this is the first time ive been on a public forum and just wondered if anyone out there can relate and help me with some moral support? I feel so low with my illness (I hate the word disease) which has been described to me year in year out, but I just feel so lonely and need some support/help as I have tried doctors/counsellors/psychiatrists but ive had no joy as it seemed I was another person on the assembly line. I waited 3 months for an appointment and all he said was "are you still bulimic" "how many times a day?" "ok I'll up your dose of anti depressants" I have been prescribed loads of anti deperassants but I dont take them as I dont want to rely on them as I tried them and they made me feel so sh*t and I couldnt sleep which was horrible as the only time im happy is when im asleep as it makes me escape the need to put my fingers down my throat...its embaressing a grown man has to worry so much about his weight to feel part of this world. I was bullied for being fat and I lost so much weight so I could 'fit in' and I have lost my weight but ive paid the biggest price of all by having this illness that restricts me from eating normally and enjoying food like a normal person and also going out for meals in public which I cant do as I dont want to embaress myself even more by going to the toilet after. This life sucks and I wish I could swap it for anyone else's but saying that I wouldnt wish this on anyone else. Can someone please talk to me and be my friend on this subject as Ive lost a good few friends due to them not wanting to associated with 'someone who makes themself sick'Anyways rant over and my email is ______  Emis Moderator comment: I have removed the email address as we do not publish these in the forums.

Every time I see food on the stove or in the lunch line I don't feel like I can eat it because it just doesn't look appealing. A family member insisted that I eat some Chinese food they bought last night and I made a bowl and I couldn't eat all of it and I didn't even get a lot of it. I tried to eat more of it but it made me really uncomfortable and I got really upset over it so I stopped and put it in the fridge. Before last night I hadn't eaten anything 3 days prior. I'm not sure why I don't seem to be able to enjoy food even when I know I need it. 
I hate my weight so much, I see my self as fat when others see me as skinny but I don't, I lie when they say how skinny I am of say how am I so skinny I just laugh but inside I feel different, I feel massive, they don't no what goes on inside my mind so when someone says a fat joke to me like I'll be fat i die inside, it's slowly killing me inside, effecting my mind a lot! The last 3 weeks I have been eating some days a lot but not loads and other day not as much. Before I would cut my calories down to under 900 but I can't seem to get back in to the dieting mood, today I didn't eat until half 4 as I had my tea then a big bag of m&ms I hated myself after eating it and tried to make my self sick which didn't work so I did a bit of exercise, as I do a little bit after I eat food. It's mot all of it just the past couple weeks it's mentally killing me all day every day is weight and food,I'm terrified of going on the scale as I have eaten. It won't stop. People think I have an eating disorder but after eating so much I don't think I do, do I? 
Hello everyone...   Just looking for some advice but not to sure what i'm going thru, over the last few days i havent been able to keep any food down, one night i had something to eat and a few hours later had a pint down the pub with a friend, then i got really bad pain in my tummy and threw up, it's not the drink because ever since then i have not been able to keep much of my food down, i have also been getting headaches alot and feeling light headed but i have been drinking enough. I just want to find out if this could be something else that needs checking...  I have had a few dizzy episodes and they seem fine just laying down but one night i slept for about 16 hours solid and still felt really tired after and had to go back to sleep for a further 4 hours.  Thanks Martin P 
Anyone wanna just talk?

People say I do but the last couple days maybe a week I have been eating normally, still haven't my weight and exercising but I've been eating, but now I will go back to cutting down because I have so much... I can't stand my weight, I hate having showers because I can see how fat I am, i once cried in the shower because of my weight,i know stupid, but it happened. I do eat but no more than 1,000 calories or just a tiny bit over and that's a bad day, I like to keep it down to under 900 but I have had a week of eating because I was so hungry but nothing more than the caloires I should be eating for my age. I am very tired of always counting caloires worry about food, when I have to pick my tea in the night I am there for ages trying to work out what to eat and the calories I do eat junk food but still nothing more than 1,000 calories, we barely had fruit or veg here so I do eat 'bad' foods. Food and weight is always on my mind, it's starting to effect me in school,I think if I'm gunna est in school and it's all the time. I am actually sick of it now but I can't stop, my kind tells me I'm fat but I don't no if it's a voice or me saying it to my self, I am giving up on my self because I think this is gong to be my life, I don't see a future in me not worrying and fearing of gaining weight, it has taking me mentally you could say. I hate seeing really skinny people because Ino I'm not like that and it kills me, I worry about clothes fitting me if I have to try something in in front if someone. I am a 16 year old girl, 5'2 and 99pounds I've lost 10 pounds since Nov I had a week of eating and went up to 103pounds I was just disgusted with my self. 
I'm 20 years old , all my life I have been extremely fussy when it comes to food I pretty much live off pizza,(just cheese) crisps sweets chips(only thin chips) I eat some meat but I'm very funny about fat. I'm always ill because I'm not getting the neutrients I need. I can't try new food without gagging or being sick. I been to see a few dieticians but they don't help. I'm fed up of being like this because when friends or family go for food I always have to look at menu to see if there's anything I'll eat 9/10 I won't like anything. Has anyone got any suggestions about what I do next? Or will I be like this forever??  
im 15 years old 5ft 3 weigh just about 7 stone ive been in recovery for the past 7 months but im finding it really really difficult and im struggling to eat 1000 calories a day i just hate food so much, im constantly tired and have no energy and im always upset i just want to get rid of anorexia now im fed up of it i cant handle it anymore, got GCSE's coming up so id like to recover soon, is there anything i can do to help me recover quickly cuz i just cant do it :'( and i havent gained any weight is there anything i can do to get to a normal weight quickly and get my appetite back xx 
I feel like im actually almost fully recovered now. im weight restored and i dont care for major restricting anymore! i never thought i would get this far but it has taking me a long time.   so even though im nearly recovered, i still have minor relapses occasionally. I crave for my small body and it feels like someone close to me (anorexia) has died and i will not be able to see them again and it really upsets me. i dont know why but i cant remeber any of the bad things i experienced at my worst points. i can only remeber being small and happy although logically i know thats not the case because i lost alot of friends/family and pretty much mucked up my education so obviously i was not happy or funcitoning adequately at all. so why i can only see myself as being the happiest i ever was when i was at my lowest weight i dont know becuase it should of been my unhappiest time right?!   i dont know if this makes any sense but yeah was just wondering if anyone else gets like this?   thanks x  
I have been seeing the eating disorder services for 12 weeks now as I was classed as having Anorexia. I have now put on a lot of weight and am just below healthy weight but recently the grip my ED has on me has got much tighter. I know I won't be classed as anorexic anymore, but I just don't want to get better. I feel so fat, especially after christmas and incredibly alone. I want to lose at least a stone and don't care where that puts me medically. I also really want to go inpatient. I don't know why other than it seems like the only way to escape life for a while without giving up my job and other things I love. I know I'm way too fat to go inpatient but I just want to be looked after. I don't know how to help myself, sorry for wasting your time. 
I've had anorexia for almost one year now, and I've heard that, in extreme cases, a calorie deficiency can cause lanugo, which is development of fine hair all over the body. Can this hair go away after recovering from anorexia? Or does it just stay until the person shaves it off or removes it in some other way? I haven't had lanugo yet, and I'm curious to know the details of how long it lasts, where it mostly gathers on the body, things like that. Thank you. 
So I had anorexia for around a year from the age of 13 and 9 months until about 14 and 10 months, I know, prime growing time right . I am also a boy which you probably weren't expecting (I think it was more an excessive compulsive thing than anorexia or body image either way I was dumb). I am currently 180cm which I know isn't exactly short but I was meant to be 6'2 or even taller (177cm at 13 and 10 months).  Anyway for a year after that I was about 60-63kg which is 7-10 under what I should have been, 70kg, especially seeing as I am not a small frame. Only now I weigh what I should have, this is because no one really told me what I should regain to, however, I still had a BMI within range of healthy, granted not by much (had very skinny legs and 19bmi or something, probably meant for small framed people like africans).   Anyway I was wondering if I grew properly in that year where I was way too skinny but within BMI and maintaining somewhat, and also just turning 16 last week, if I still have a chance to grow all that height I lost back from the first year (and potentially the second), now that I am a perfect normal weight and am drinking lots of milk. 
I suffer with bulimia. For the last couple of weeks I've noticed the odd twinge in my lower back while purging (standing and bending over). A few days ago I moved from sitting to standing and my back just seemed to give out causing me to be in a lot of pain when I move, especially between sitting and standing. I saw my GP and he told me I'd pulled a muscle. Is it possible that the purging caused this? I have been bulimic for roughly 15 years but lately I have been binging and purging several times a day (more than usual). I've never had any problems with my back before and, other than a lot of reflux, am generally healthy. I'm 34 and female. 
I have been on Mirtazapine 45mg and Venlafaxine 225 mg for the last 3 years for PTSD, depression and an eating disorder.  Following a crisis last year my pyschiatrist said I would need to stay on the combination for at least 2 more years.  But I have been feeling a lot better for months so I persuaded a new GP to let me start coming off them.  It's been 3 weeks now and I have gone down to just 75mg of Venlafaxine.  Apart from nausea I don't seem to be having withdrawal symptoms but mentally I feel bad and I am not eating properly again.  I have gone down 2 dress sizes in 3 weeks.  I don't want to go back on the tablets but know I am not right, I don't know what to do.  Has anyone else been in this situation? 
18 months Ago I started losing weight and found it difficult to eat,I had the magic eye and was found to have a ulcer at the bottom of the tube,they believed it could be sinster,many months down the line various treatments and investigations they found I was producing excess acid,but even though I do not have cancer,I am stll suffering from extreme pain and am scared of eating as the pain goes around to the back.I have been going to gp and she has given me morphine,but in doing this all my ms drugs I cant take so have double pain  Has anyone else had something similar jacquie 
I'm 15 years old. I'm 5'2 and weigh approx. 97lbs as of today. I have never been able to gain a ton of weight. I've never weighed 100lbs. The past week and a half or so I have been doing all that I can to gain weight. I've grown to dislike my figure and how my body looks. I have this strange feelings planted in my mind that if I don't have "curves" then no guy is to ever find me sexy or attractive. I've pretty much shoved as much food as I can down my throat. Yesterday I weighed 99.7lbs and my goal is to get to 100 and then eventually 115. My problem is, that I think the changes in my eating habits, (not eating very often to eating 4 meals and 5-6 snack sessions a day) has been making me very sick and worrisome. Is it bad to change your eating habits so drastically in such a short amount of time? And is that possibly the cause to my sickness? Thank you for taking your time to read what I have to say.  
I'm 15 years old and have had an eating disorder for the past 3 years its also caused me depression and its having a huge impact on my life, I was only eating 600-700 calories per day and I weigh just about 7 stone and im 5ft 4, I've been recovering for the past 6/7 months and been eating around 1100-1300 calories per day but its really hard (as I still hate food) and no one seems to understand, I don't seem to be gaining much weight is there any tips or advice on things I can do to gain weight quickly and start to develop into a normal weight person because Its really difficult  
Hey,  Two years ago I started to recover from my eating disorder. I started out bulimic but it quickly turned to anorexia for years. I didn't really want to get better but I did through a mental health team and dieticians. Ever since, I've been eating three meals a day with the once a week treat of a chocolate bar or pudding. (Makes me cringe to write that.)  Porridge in the morning (sometimes with chopped banana like they told me to)  Cheese and apple wholemeal sandwich or a small bowl of homemade soup for lunch  Dinner could be anything from chilli with rice or a vegetable stew ( I'm vegetarian) I'd say it was a fair portion, not a pigs plate!  In the two years I have morphed into a blob monster going from size 6 hanging off me my hips to a size 14. My leg won't even fit in a skirt I used to wear!  I'm good at following diets and very strict.  But somehow I've gained all this weight?!! It's seriously making me consider suicide, I'm vulnerable as it is with my mental health so poor. If I got to this weight in two years where will I end up in a few years? It's making me panic.  I must admit I do not exercise anymore, I cannot be in public as it terrifies me so I don't walk anywhere. I'm also ashamed of my size. Could no exercise be the problem? Im a musician so i get no exercise working either. Once I start an exercise routine at home I know I'll become obsessed like before but maybe it's the only way?   What could anyone recommend?  I would be very grateful for some advice 
Because I've been eating either nothing or very little for some time , my care team have got in touch with the eating disorders team and I've been put on a "pre meal plan" which basically works out at about 900 calories including fluids (mainly milk) . I'm already trying to cheat my way out of it , by reducing what I can hear and there and the milk was the first thing to go   I was wondering if any of you know something high in calcium etc (like milk) but low in calories I could try if such thing exists .  I managed to stick to it for one day and now I'm off on a long walk (which I've been told to cut down on as well) it's like they try to take all control off the bat and that just isn't guna work with me   Thanks  
I am 18 years old, 5"10 and approx 144 pounds. Since I was 6 I have thought I had a problem with my weight, my parents stopping me from wearing a bikini at this age probably contributed to this. As a child (from aged 6-13) I essentially had a beer belly so my parents took me to see doctors, dietians, nutritionists because they thought my body was allergic to something within my diet causing the beer belly affect. Turns out I was just fat. I used to take food from my kitchen and eat it in the toilet because I was embarrassed.  In the present day I try my best to follow a healthy diet and exercise regime which I started a bit over a year ago and which I've been able to lose 10 pounds because of. However, now that I've finally lost some weight the discomfort/unhappiness with my body has increased. I can't get changed in the same room as others and I refuse to wear a bikini or tight clothes (not that I could wear any of that before anyway). I am often disgusted with my body and have in the past tried diet pills/weight loss teas which have not worked. I have tried to make myself sick quite a few times due to feeling so unbelievably remorseful about overeating, however sometimes I am unable to be sick. Countless times I have cried about my body and not once have I spoken to my family about it. I can't. I love my family but they sometimes mock my 'healthy lifestyle' and they don't realise that when I'm alone I still binge and later feel revolted with myself, I have been feeling particularly stressed over the past few weeks and therefore this problem of overeating has got worse. I try to eat 1,200 calories a day because I still want to lose more weight, I want to be 9 and a half stone. I exercise approx 3-4 times a week doing intensive training to aid my weight loss.  I'm really scared I will never get rid of the mentality that I am so fat and I'm scared that I will never be happy with my body. Only recently I've considered that I may have an eating disorder as my body/dieting/food occupies my mind for hours a day but I don't know for certain. Any advice is welcome and thank you for taking the time to read what I have to say.

Hi, so i have been suffering from an eating disorder this year and i finally got checked up about it in July and have been trying to gain weight, but i am experiencing some of the worst side effects. besides the mental ones, such as depression and anxiety, i have been having terrible constipation, the worst bloating ever and that constant feeling of feeling full. i have gone from eating 850 calories a day to 1100, to now about 1500-1600. is this still enough to gain about 4 kilos in about 2 months? i need some tips, advice, stories, pelase! has anyone else gone through this and had my side effects and have tips on how to rid bloating and constipation. ive tried laxatives, prunes, etc. 
For sometime I have had IBS. But recently I think its an intolerence to Gluten. I tried Gluten free Porridge and Pasta and seem OK after it. I am going to ask my GP for a test. However, one think that I can't undersand as to why this causes me problems is a Poached egg. I used to be able to eat them but not anymore, yet I can eat eggs in other ways including a fried egg without a problem. Anyone expericed this problem? 
am a 21 year old female, I am 5'3 and weigh around 103-104lb (7 stone 5-6lb).  I used to be just under 10 stone a few years ago and crash dieted to lose the weight. I wanted to be 9 stone, then 8 and a half, then 8, then I was happy bouncing between 7.10-7.12 for a few months. But recently it has dropped, I was fine at 7 and a half, but as it's gone down I've wanted it to stay down. I weigh myself everyday before eating/drinking. If my weight is at 7.5 I'm not too bad, but jf it js at 7.6 I panic that I'm getting fat and will keep gaining. I try not to eat until my evening meal, which I always make sure I havr, though sometimes end up snacking before if I start to feel too hungry. I have 2 cups of tea a day with 2 sugars in each to try and suppress my hunger. I also worry that when I start eating, I won't stop. Sometimes I will have a big takeaway, medium pizza all to myself, cobtinue eating it even if it hurts, and then half an hour after, continue eating. I never make myself sick/take laxitives and wouldn't, but I sometimes try not to eat all day in case I lose control and keep eating and eating. I have anxiety/depression/ocd ossues anyway and I'm worried I may have some sort of eating disorder too.  Sorry if this is a lot of jumble, but any advice would be much appreciated, thanks. 
Bit of a random question - I was diagnosed with epilepsy a year after my eating disorder symptoms had begun.  I have recently discovered three people who have epilepsy and eating disorder, and am intrigued as to whether this is more common than immediately thought. Did my eating problems trigger my seizures.  Can anyone relate? 
Hi I'm Tom and I'm 17 I had my major anorexia 2 years ago and relapsed again September 2014, 4 months down the line I'm the best I've ever been and can't stop eating. I'm worried though as I'm 5 foot 8 at current but my estimated height is 5 foot 11 and I'm terrified I'll never reach that. 
Hi, i'm 15  About 18 months ago, I was border line anorexic.. Now i'm in my recovery and have reached my personal goal. Since I began recovery, I wanted to help other people that have been through or are going through the same thing as myself or even something completely different. There is nothing where I live that allows me to do this, no support groups or anything..   This website is amazing, and I believe we should all work together. Like one big family. Share our stories, help each other out. It's rewarding, i promise  if you agree, please vote and let someone know that there are people out there who care. Thank you, Holly x 
Hi, right i know this will sound crazy but ever since last week, i have started a diet. I dont know how i came about it but I am 5 ft 2 and i weighed 137 pounds and i thought that was too big and i just counted calories for one day as an experiment to see how much i ate and i was shocked to find it was 2000 so i since then i have not eaten over 1000, i simply cut out food or replace food so i manage to stay under 1000. one day i only ate 500 and i felt like that was good but i know its not the normal amount. i weigh myself at least 6 times a day, even when i dont realise i am doing it and i drink herbal tea all the time which is a diretic (dont know how to spell it) i felt fine the first few days but today on the way to college i felt sick and couldnt eat all day so today i only had 700. can someone help i tried not to count them today but i felt like i left a candle burning in my room if i didnt, its quickly becoming bad an i know its only a week but i dont want it to be serious i am now 128 pounds and dont want to be too thin. what should i do? 
I'm 22 and have always been someone who over eats. I have noticed I binge when I am going through difficult times. This year, I have been through quite a lot and feel very stressed. Previously to this year I lost a good amount of weight and started feeling happy about myself. Since I have been feeling down about certain things that have happened this year, I have noticed that I have been eating more again.   I would like to find some strategies to help me cope when I feel the need to binge. I don't want to put weight on. I am someone who really enjoys healthy eating, and I know exactly what I should be eating, but I have the urge to eat unhealthy, sweet food when I am feeling down.   I recently went to the doctors about my eating habbits and they put me on anti depressants to help boost my mood, and therefore take away the urge to binge however, I have always been someone that doesn't agree with taking tablets and I don't like the idea of having to rely on a tablet to make me feel happy.(I don't judge anyone who does take them, it is just a personal preference).   I have thought about how I feel before, during and after binge eating, and I have realised that I don't feel happy or satisfied during any point while I am eating, so don't understand why I do it, as it makes me feel so disgusting.  If anyone can give me any advice, I would really appreciate it.   Thanks in advance,   Lizzy 
Hi Everyone,  I have suffered with anorexia for 7 years, I have been on a weight gain meal plan for about 4 months, but over the past 2 months I have been suffering with total lack of energy to the point that even moving seems like a lot of hard work.  I am waiting for blood test results, but I think they will come back as normal.  I am very close to a healthy weight, so I am concerned why this has started happening now.  I have been told to rest and continue with my meal plan, but this is very difficult for me, I've always been quite an active person, so this is very hard for me to cope with.  I'm just wondering if this is completely normal and will my energy levels come back and when will this likely happen?  Thanks for any replies  
I've been bulimic for about fifteen years.  I also have a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder for which I am prescribed medication (sertraline, Lithium, aripiprazole and a depixol depot injection).  I've never found the medication to be of any help.  Could this be because of the constant purging?  I probably vomit within an hour of taking the meds.  Does that give them enough time to enter my blood stream or am I getting them out of my body before they have a chance to do any good?  My psychiatrist has commented on my erratic lithium levels (it often comes back low) and I wonder if this could be a reason.  Is there any point in taking the pills if I'm going to vomit them up anyway? 
Hi, I'm 29 years old, 5'2" in height and weigh 46.5kg. I was recently diagnosed with underactive thyroid and I read that hypothyroid people are usually overweight. I've always been slim and petite so that aspect of my illness has never registered. Whenever I've gone to thyroid support meetings the other members immediately guess that I'm hyperthyroid and are shocked when I say that I'm the opposite. I like to look nice when I go anywhere (I don't obsess about it) but I don't like it when I get young girls glaring at me or men looking at me. I have also had unwanted attention from other men and I tend to avoid them when they say/do certain things.  I have no desire to eat - when I say I have no desire to eat it's mainly where I have no desire to eat healthy foods. The only foods I'm likely to touch are:  * Crisps (same ones - sea salt and vinegar) * Cakes * Sweets (certain ones but when I have eaten the same ones for so long I change to another type of sweets and go back to the other ones when I'm fed up of those) * Chocolate (certain ones but when I have eaten the same chocolate for so long I change to another type of chocolate and go back to the other type of chocolate when I'm fed up of that) * Yogurts (always the same ones and I've never gotten fed up of them - lemon creamy yogurt made with whipping cream) * Bread * Cheese (I'm not meant to eat cheese that much because it gives me reflux but that doesn't stop me.)  I have been measuring my BMI but I haven't lost a lot of weight and when I spoke to my employment assessor she was worried that I am now in the underweight range. I don't know how to go about telling my GP that I have this unstoppable craving for sweet, salty, milky foods because I know that I will instantly be in their bad books.  Can anyone advise why I am so addicted to the foods I listed? Could it be a deficiency in a vitamin/mineral? I already know I am Vitamin D and iron deficient but my GP and endocrinologist haven't checked me for any other deficiencies and I really feel that they should.  Ferritin (checked in August) - 28 (30-400) Vitamin D (checked in October) - 73 (>75), up from 59.6 in June (>75) Folate (checked in July) - 4.9 (4.6-18.7) Vitamin B12 (checked in August) - 362 (180-900) 
Just because im in such a desperate place, ive had an eating issue since i was about 16 now 49 ive kind of had really bad downs and recognised the control around how much i eat and exercise. The last 18 months have been hell, i was admotted to a psychiatric unit October 2013 for depression, i was aware that my food intake was becoming less and less and obsessive exercise more.It then became all i could think about and was also going through a very horrible divorce with a a  man who was emotionally abusive, I was officially diagnosed with annorexia and again admotted to a psychiatric unit for a re feeding programme weighing 43kg, with support from the eaing disorder team. I was then discharged and missed 2 appointments because i also have depression so they closed my case. I have support from  the MH team , but i have in total been in hospital 7 times 4 months in psychatric and the other medical because of OD. I now weigh 35kg BMI of 13 and just dont want to live. Im sharing this because im desperate and anyone else out there is struggling please dont leave it untill it takes over your life. If you have worries about eating issues seek help before it takes control, im not sure where my future is all i know is the complete lack of understaanding and support is so utterly isolating all i can think about is a way out 
Hello I'm a British student studying in austria, and I have annorexia � I've recently managed to increase  my weight from 6St8 to 7 St3 (I'm 5.6 btw) bug I'm just struggling so much!!! I really want to be 8 stone by the 19th of December cos I want to please my mum and my family but I can't get bast 7.5 withour relapsing. Iv tried to stop weighing myself but i can't get the bad thoughts to stop ..... I hardly eat anything in the day and mainly eat cabbage and veg for dinner.  I feel lost stuck in a cycle with no one to help. No one in my family understands my mind ....and say things like why do nt you just eat.... but they don't understand the mental your Cher of eating is so much worse then their complaints. I'm studying medical and pharmaceutical bio technology and spend half my day studying the bodies functions yet cant seem to get over my mental food block to give my body the nutrition to function as it should. I love food and love cooking and the anticipation of eating.... but hate the after feeling. I just want to be normal and not worry about going to lunch or constably thinking about food. I no longer have periods I have chilblains on my fingers....I'm just not happy or healthy still despite gaining some weight. I gained my weight by stopping exercising and embarrassing lying chewing and spitting out chocolate. I'm not bulimic (due to tonsillectomy I'm too scared to be lol ) but by chewing and spitting u eat some chocolate without knowing the calories ....Therefore it doesn't trigger restriction regression....I sound crazy I know! But I really really hate carbs ....The idea bread or pasts litterally makes want to hide.....I just have happy memories of being a normal weight and enjoying jacket potatoes spontaneously without worrying or fixating on it as the highlight or only meal of her day. Sorry for the rant I just really want some help and support. Especially cos I'm abroad and feel so alone. I really feel I need a meal plan or something but I've eaten so little for so long, way under 1000 calories a day --when I gained weight initially I had the worst night sweats and propearly fainted twice in my bed,  I also got really sore skin on my belly like water retension. My night sweats are slightly better now but I'm still only eating like 500 calories a day. I the my self for it but I can't stop... I feel so crappy If I properly eat before a certain time in the day... I'm just so stuck in my ridiculous ways. Sorry for the rant,  do you think you may be abe yo help at all? Thank you - especially if you didn't give up reading âº 
Every time I see food on the stove or in the lunch line I don't feel like I can eat it because it just doesn't look appealing. A family member insisted that I eat some Chinese food they bought last night and I made a bowl and I couldn't eat all of it and I didn't even get a lot of it. I tried to eat more of it but it made me really uncomfortable and I got really upset over it so I stopped and put it in the fridge. Before last night I hadn't eaten anything 3 days prior. I'm not sure why I don't seem to be able to enjoy food even when I know I need it. 
Hi all! So i have been going through a really tough time since about july. I had been diagnosed with an eating disorder after an appointment with the doctor where i am down to 44.5kgs. I am trying to get back to about 48kg. It doesnt sound like i lost a lot, but i am a very small frame already and quiet short, so yes, this was a dramatic loss on me. Anyway, i have definitely realized over the past few months that i was not being healthy and i got down to too low of a weight, so im trying to recover. I am now at about 45.5-46kgs. this is good news! although, i have been going through terrible constipation (which over the past week has actually become a lot better thankfully due to prunes, upping my fibre and overall intake and dandellion tea at night- i reccommend!) although, i am always sooo bloated. this has really emotionally gotten to me because i used to never bloat so now im really uncomfortable. its going to be summer soon and im going to feel so insecure in a bikini if im bloated, im worried it will get in the way of my recovery. When i bloat its obvious because the rest of me is so thin so i look funny. Does anyone know when the chronic bloating will stop after meals? Or how i can reduce it, tips, tricks or just foods to stay away from? it would mean so much to me! I also am just wondering, foods i should be eating to gain weight but in a healthy manner. thanks to whoever answers this. I just need some reassuarance i guess, but also some legitimate advice and honesty.  
Hello All,  Using this site just to get out how I feel. Feel like i'm tied up and have nowhere to turn at the minute. I'm a 25 year old lad. Loved my food throughout growing up. But never worried about it. Family would be amazed by how much I could eat but i'm active and I never really strayed over 13 and a half stone. I would have nights of binging but it was fun.  Now it all changed 9 months ago really. I bought a house with my now fiancée. She was in education towards a degree at the time so it was left to me to pay the way until she completed. Which I knew and I was 100% fine with. Now around the same time I started having difficulty with eating and have self diagnosed an intolerance to gluten and lactose. So I have removed them from my diet. But it resulted in me checking the labels of everything I eat and becoming much more aware of what I was putting inside me. This coupled with my money worries meant I was stressed and felt I had no control. I think this is where it began. By it I mean binging and then purging. It started on nights out with my mates. I'd drink, then eat, then the guilt, then purge when nobody was looking. This became all too easy and it began to happen when sober. After a big sunday roast. At one point just after a couple of small chocolates in work. I'd go to the toilets. I felt out of control. Stopped drinking entirely. And I now cycle 150 miles a week. I beat myself up if I dont do it. Feel like a failure. I usually succeed in it thought which makes me feel like i'm in control.  I binge and purge probably once a week. Usually sat or sunday. I'm very strict with my eating in the week so come saturday night the shackles come off. I did a food diary for a while. It seemed to help which made me feel like a worrier and that nothing was wrong so i'd stop. Then the purging would start again. The thing that amazes me is that i'm a clever lad, no my rights from wrongs, and yet sometimes i'm eating knowing full well i'll bring it all back up straight after. I cant understand it. I am obviously weak and out of control. Its embarrassing. I always thought I was strong and smart.  I have told my fiancée and she is supportive, but she doesn't know what to do. I dont tell her that i'm doing it so she thinks i'm over it and doing fine. I've told my Dad but he just found it difficult so has forgotten I ever mentioned it. It worries the life out of  me but I dont know what to do. It feels like thats just who I am. Nothing can change.  For your information my fiancée is now fully employed and we are both earning. I still worry about money, its in my blood, but we are doing great. I am very conscious about my weight and look. I see the very worst in myself. My gluten problems have been put on a 10 month weighting list. I just feel with Christmas coming up i'm going to really lose control.  I've gone on forever. But this is 9 months of thoughts on a page. Thanks for reading if you've got this far. 
Hi all,  I am a 36 year old male, and have suffered with an eating disorder since i was 16.  When it first hit i was terrified of food, being thin was all that mattered, so simply not eating seemed the obvious thing to do.  As the years passed, with long term visits to therapy i thought i was more or less dealing with things well.  I still at times had bizarre rituals around what food seemed safe, places, utensils etc - but i thought i had come to terms with it.  Yet here i am again, a nervous breakdown at the start of this year.  At therapy my therapist concentrates a lot on the mentality and disordered thinking of my eating disorder.  I do eat, and probably eat ok - the rules are still there, but presently they dont distress me too much.  I wanted to ask others about how they moved on, and is it possible?  I feel my long term depression and anxiety just is never ending - food always plays a big part - but at the same time i never have blamed food for the continuation of my problems, to me it seems more of a symptom.  My therapist tells me i have low self esteem, black and white thinking etc - she says all the traits of someone with an ED.  How then can food at times seem to not be so troublesome, but the traits persist and make things so hard to deal with?! 
I have never spoke to anyone about this so I am not officially diagnosed and may not even be posting this is in the right place. I have had issues around food for the last five years, I would describe them as bad habits, skipping meals and only eating a very small selection of safe foods, weighing foods and counting calories. These habits seem to change in severity from time to time. I also binge after days of being hungry. I don't eat in front of anyone except for my partner not even my step children and never go out for meals. My weight is the lowest it's ever been but my bmi only just puts me into the underweight category. I don't know if these things mean I have an eating disorder or not, either way I need some help and advice. I hate missing out on attending friends birthday meals and date nights and spending hours cooking for my family each day and never eating with them. My partner is being destroyed with worry and upset and when I've binged and feel guilty he is at the receiving end of my emotions which racks me with guilt and self loathing further. please could someone help me? 
I have suffered from bulimia since 1998. I havn't recieved any medical attention and nobody close to me knows I'm bulimic. I basically stopped purging in 2009 but I did not stop the binging, resulting in a massive weight gain (I now weight 17st!). I don't know what to do; I don't know how to eat normally and I have started to purge again. I am reluctant to go to my doctor as I am embarrased and ashamed. Either way my health is suffering and I feel disgusted in myself. I have no self control! 
I'm 20 (weigh around 105 pounds) and living in the UK for a term as an exchange student from Canada. Since being here, I've eaten one small meal a day, and I don't know why, except that I can't convince myself to eat more. I feel so low and anxious about food that it's consuming my life. I don't really have any healthcare options here so I wonder if anyone has any other suggestions? Thank you x 
I have recently discovered that for almost 20 years I have been what is called binging and purging.  I'm in shock to discover that something I have accepted in myself to be "my normal" is actually a eating disorder.  I haven't binged and purged for the whole time non stop of course there have been moments of non purging causing significant weight gain and leaving me confused as to why I have gained weight, of course without the purge was bound to happen. I'm still very confused as this has all been brought alight to me after recently binging and purging for three whole weeks non stop after not purging for approximately 7-8 months with half the binge. I have been feeling pretty low lately and I guess I've swayed all my worried just directly over to my weight causing the purging to start again.  I've come to terms with the emotional connection and the food connection and even the purging as to why I do it. What I'm here to ask really is how do I convince myself to stop, the cravings for the binge are strong and the self discuss after and guilt and self loathe are to depressing to now stop the purge. I'm ever so confused   
I'm getting really concerned over my friend, her eating habit is awful, all she eats is cereal and chocolate, maybe the odd time she will have a chicken or egg sandwhich. Lately she's been feeling sick all the time and shaking with back pains, I've told her she needs to eat more vitamins and try new healthy foods but she just won't do it.  I just need some answers on why she's feeling like this? I've been her friend all her life and I can see her going downhill and it's getting me worried.   Many thanks.  
After a long battle with my eating disorder this year I was diagnosed with anorexia. After a number of months of restricting and quiet a rapid weight loss things reached crisis point and I have recently started on a more recovery focused eating plan. The only thing is, now I have started to eat a more varied diet I have begun to feel really quiet ill. I am constantly cold (a lot more so than I was when restricting), I feel exhausted and seem to be sleeping tonnes and perhaps the worst symptom I ache ALL over. Has anyone else expereinced this? Is it normal and how long will it last? Any advice or info would be greatly recieved

I have been suffering with unusual eating habits for three years now. I starve, binge and purge! I don't think I need help because I don't do it very often, I am able to switch my eating habits so my family don't get suspicious. But lately it's getting harder, I have started self harming again and I'm frightened that I might actually have something wrong with me, this is my last hope, I don't know what to do...do I need help because a part of me feels  like I can keep this a secret for longer.  
 I have recently been falling into the cycle of binging and purging, and although i do go through phases where I stop doing it, i still keep on coming back to it.  About 18 months ago was the first time I did it with great consistansy (although i had gone through phases of doing it once or twice, or a few times a week, or once a week for a month for a while, but never enough to really raise it as a problem in my mind). But then after starting a post christmas diet, I became overly obsessed with weighing myself, and loosing weight, but was unable to stick to such a strict diet and very soon after starting it i started to binge on all the foods that i was restricting myself, and then purging them. I started doing this daily, and sometime more than once a day, and this lasted for about 3 month, before I got so fed up and gradually reduced it, and then stopped.  For a couple of months I didnât do it, and then since then I have been doing it in phases on and offâ¦for a while it was a week or two (at times every week for a month) and then not at all for one, two or maybe three weeks. Then in february I started doing it a lot more, at times it was every day, and at the least it was once a week. Since then, bar a week or two i have been doing it most weeksâ¦.and the times I have gone maybe a week without doing it, Iâve felt so relieved, and then its all started over again. I am aware Iâm not the sort of person who is good at strictly restricting my diet, as I just end up binging, I have started doing more exercise, and have been focusing on trying to eat healthy and still treat myself so Im not so tempted, but I still end up binging. I have been better in the past month or two at trying not to do it too many days in a row, as when i get into doing it like that I find it so hard to even cut back, and I get so bloated and feel horrible, but I just canât seem to stop, and Iâm getting fed up.  I feel like the cycle Iâm in is not that bad, and that it hasnât been going on for long at all, but I just want to be able to loose some weight in a healthy way, and stop reverting back to this habit! How can I do this?  Sorry the post is so long, thanks in advance for any replies  
I should start off by saying that i used to binge eat for a while then started to binge and purge. After that i started to stop eating and binge when the cravings got too bad every few days. Ive been to therapy for 2 years and it really hasnt helped. I also cut myself very frequently.  Now ive just started college and i find myself binge eating all the time. Im upset bc ive gained weight but also because im afraid to tell anyone. I feel like all i think about is food now. my daily thoughts are plagued with this need to eat everything. I share an apartment with 3 girls and i eat their food to the point where theyve gotten upset. i am fat but people say i am average. Please help, i dont know what to do. im sorry.. 
I need help as a carer, first of all i will tell you where iv been for help then whats going on. iv been to my GP, my local mental health hospital, private councillors, the norfolk mental health board, the nhs, even my MP, and nobody can help. My partener of 21 years has got anorexia, she has had this for about 30 years, on and off, we have 3 children together ages 19, 17 and 14. after 5 years of complaining to all of the above we fianally got an appointment to see a phycriatrist, who after 30 mins desided to say she has a simple eating disorder!!!!!!!   Now to me a simple eating disorder dont do the things she does, like threaten to stab me with a knife, teaches our 17 year old daughter the ways of an anorexic ( now she is just about 5 stone and very ill ), mentally attacks our youngest daughter most of the time and constantly without failier mentally attacks me every time she opens her mouth. this has got to much so she moved out leaving the children with me, but still mentally attacks us all, all of the time.  She has no feelings at all, unless she talks to a PROFFESSIONAL  then she laughs and jokes like nothing is wrong.  As we live in the waveney area there is not alot of help. Do anyone know what or where i can go next for help not just for me for my family and now ex partener.  PLEASE HELP SOMEONE IM DESPERATE.

Hello all,  To give you all some background information I am 24 and have had "bulimia" for the past 8 years. It started by stopping to eat, got really skinny and depressed. I felt like sh*t both mentally and physically. I am a social busy bee but back then I lost it all. My mom found out in the most horrible ways and tried to help me recover. I did my best an at 1 point I was totally clean and healthy for 3 months. Then my boyfriend dumped me and I stopped giving a sh*t and went back to me old habbits. It soon turned into binge eating and throwing up. The thing is, I don't remember a lot from back then... except for having a really bad relationship with my mom. She tried to help it, I know it, but she was spying on me and ripping me off every single privacy. I could feel the pressure to recover and it didn't help me at all.  Fast forward into the future. I love travelling and it has done a lot of good things for me. Somehow I found a way to be very socially active even with my eating disorder. I can actually throw up in just a few seconds (managed to get my throat open somehow...). and the fact that I eat so much and love food so much is very liked by people... I grew into a very succesful woman. I have good looks, good social life, good jobs and things are going great in my life. Even my health (except for the teeth) is very okay despite my binge habbits!!! I don't even consider myself "sick" anymore. I've accepted it as a part of myself and don't try to change it. I'm not obsessed by it and it makes my life so much easier. I'm truely very happy. I know that if I would try to recover now... my life would such and I would be very unhappy. So I don't want and don't plan on recovering. I know it's a bad message for you guys out there that want to recover... so don't give up hope!   The thing is that our house... well sometimes the toilets clog because the recolt bin (something in the street that takes all the sh*t etc...) fills up with all my throwing up. So every 2 years my mom discovers I never recovered. I guess she must lie to herself cause I always come up with stupid excuses like "my contraception made me really sick" blablablabla. It happened again. And my mom kind of searched through my whole room and found my weed (that I used to calm down a very very very bad tooth ache... it made me sleep) and must think I'm addicted or something. She's been searching through my room a few times like when she did when I was younger... it pisses me off 'cause I've got nothing to hide but I feel that my privacy is stripped down...  So here I'm not really sure on how to deal with my mom? I'm the 3rd of 4 kids and there's always been a lot of pressure on me to do things "perfectly". I stopped caring though. I know I can just move away and get my own place... but I guess that would not be the good way to act, no?   
I've been suffering with an eating disorder for nearly 15 years now. I've had intensive inpatient treatment, day care and outpatient therapy...etc.  I'm currently paying privately for outpatient, because I'm too stable for NHS services but had a major relapse last year, and couldn't have coped without treatment (otherwise I would have ended up in an NHS inpatient unit). I should note I have since ended up in A and E three times this year with eating disorder related symptoms.  I've made so much progress this time round, but my therapist announced that she's going to me moving on in January, and I'm so scared, because I'm not ready. I need more time and although she's given me plenty of warning (and time to prepare with my dietician) there is no way I'll be ready by Jan to be discharged from outpatient services.  Can anyone relate to this, and does anyone have any suggestions of alternatives. The NHS services are not an option. I've been through the assessment pathway, and unless I make myself seriously unwell I won't even get offered outpatient treatment.  Most community services require an NHS referral so you have to be in the system to get this.  It's just bad timing! 
Hi everyone,  This is my first post and indeed my first time ever reaching out online for support. But having unsuccessfully and repeatedly (I'm talking over 100 times at least!) tried to overcome binge eating disorder on my own, I thought it might be time to seek support.  I'm now 25 years old and have been struggling with varying degrees of binge eating disorder since I was 15. I feel completely trapped on a seemingly never-ending cycle consisting of a period of very restricted eating and lots of exercise which typically lasts 1-2 weeks and then an episode of severe binge eating which can last anything from 1 day to a week. During a binge I eat until I feel horrific and there have been times when I've genuinely feared that my stomach will rupture! My heartrate goes through the roof and I feel extremely dehydated but struggle to physically fit any water in my stomach as it's so full. I eat classic binge foods such as cake, chocolate, biscuits, desserts - anything that is 'forbidden' and feel so out of control. The next day it's almost feels like I was a different person, or possessed during the binge. It's horrible and I always feel so disgusting and ashamed afterwards. But once the episode has passed I vow to myself 'that was definitely the last time', go back to extremely restricted eating and the cycle happens all over again. It's exhausting and is affecting my work, my social life, my finances and my self esteem.   I'd love to hear from anyone who can relate to this, perhaps who has managed to take steps to overcome their own destructive eating patterns. I have tried counselling in the past, but I didn't find it very effective. I think the problem is that I am SO aware of what I'm doing, it's hard to address it as I know I have a huge problem, I just seem completely unable to stop. It's like a form of self-harm when I binge as I am so conscious that I am sabotaging all the hard work I've put into losing weight every time.   Anyway, I'd love to hear from you if you have any advice which you think might be able to help.  Thanks,  Heather 
Gawd this is difficult.  Ok I'm mid 40's  think I'm happy have a ok job, married and enjoy a beer wiv me buddies twice a week BUT for as long as I can remember when ever I'm on my own ie at home I EAT FOR England. I eat 8 plus sandwiches 4 choc bars a micro dinner (throw up) then pasties pies ltrs of coke until I feel like I gonna pass out then throw up an do it again until someone comes home :-( its now come to the stage where no matter how hard I try when I make myself sick only acid water comes up and no food (sorry) I'm obviously piling on the pounds have chronic acid reflux and every few days feel like I'm gonna die. First time I put anything out like this but think its time for advise.  
I am at my wits end, I am huge and have no self esteem whatsoever. I'm getting married next year and how can I expect my fiance to love me the way I am, if I don't love myself. I battled with a combination of anorexia and bulemia when I was younger for years and never got myself properly sorted out. Since then I have gone from one extreme to the other I now binge eat but still have the bulemic tendancies. I have tried everything. All my meals I cook are made from scratch, low fat and healthy, but my portion control and secret snacking are undoing all my hard work and I can't seem to stop it. Don't know what to do or where to turn to anymore. 
 am 23 and for the past year I have been battling with anorexia. In the last 2 months or so it's gotten really bad and I have become totally obsessed. I only eat a couple of apples/raw carrots during the day and then a salad or something for dinner. If I can't make it to the gym I freak out to the point where I feel sick with anxiety. I have become sneaky with my food and lie to my family and friends about how much I've eaten. I have always been slim but people around me are getting increasingly concerned about my drastic weight loss, and are encouraging me to put on more.   Tonight I have just binge eaten to the point where I physically want to hurt myself. I am completely distraught at what I've eaten and my stomach is in bits; ice cream, chocolate, cake - you name it, i've eaten it. I can't move from my bed - both frozen in disgust and because i am physically in so much pain from my bloated stomach.   I am crying and absolutely freaking out. I know this isn't normal behaviour and has made me realise how completely unhealthy my relationship with food has become. I don't want to be this person anymore....but neither do I want to gain any weight.   I have no idea why I am posting here but I just need some help/advice....(and for someone to tell me that this binge won't have ruined everything I've worked so hard for)   Please help. 
So recentlty i've been entertaining the thought of accepting that i may have an eating disorder. Since i was about 14 I've been experiencing body image problems, but they never manifested into anything serious (or so i thought). I was probably about 16 (im 17 and a half now) when i began acting upon this potential eating disorder. I'm constantly tracking what i eat to the point where it's obsessive and i get annoyed at myself for my lack of ability to think about anything else. I count calories, frequently weigh myself, but the worst part is that it feels normal. I dont feel sick. Some days i eat more than i should, some days i eat nothing at all. But i never starve myself. If im not hungry, i wont eat. I've gone days eating absolutely nothing but with out feeling hungry.  Can someone please help me get to the bottom of whatever this is?  Side note: I'm 5'5'', 121 lbs 
I have been struggling with anorexia nervosa for about 8 months and my advise to all young girls who have it already or think they are developing the symptoms would be to not let it get hold of you, you will regret it so much. I have never felt so lonely, tired, anxious and depressed than i do now.  I have not been myself for ages and miss the old times when i could eat what i want without feeling guilty or feeling the need to exercise accessively or make myself sick. it really does affect everyone around you and makes you feel worse knowing that your causing people to worry or have some cause for concern.  My mum and family suffer the most, always watching what i eat and having the constant thought of calories.  Even though my family and friends(who i am becoming distant from)are suffering, no one is suffering like i am.I cry all the time as it annoys me to feel and think the things i do.  To be honest i have felt sometimes like suicide to get away for how i'm feeling but then iv'e let it beat me. I used to weigh 10stone 8 pounds which to me was fat and i was always uncomfortable with this weight considering i had two thin older sisters. I wanted to do something about it,so i went on my own diet cutting out certain foods but i was still eating and i was healthy. Eventually i started to lose weight and it felt good having people tell me that i have lost weight.  I kept giving myself targets to reach like 9stone. i told myself if i could get to this weight then i will stop and can be proud of what i accomplished.  But it didn't end there, i kept taking it further and further and lost control.  I became obsessed with exercise and cutting out fattening foods, like crisps, sweets, chocolate, coke and my personal favourite cakes.Everyday i planned and still do plan what i eat trying to eat as less calories as i could, but sometimes the temptations were unbearable, to have one biscuit or sweets the things i began to crave haunted me. I kept saying one wont hurt you, but i felt so guilty for eating these things that the only way toget it out of my head was to make myself sick, so it was like i never ate it in the first place.  My fingers were dry and saw, my mouth started developing sores and my mouth sometimes bled. I hated making myself sick and it made me feel worse aswell as better.  I new i had a problem and an eating disorder and so did my best friend who didn't know what to do to help me.  I realised that i needed help when we took a family holiday and was still inducing vomiting aswell as swimming constantly and taking advantage of the free gym.  I just wanted to tell my mum or my sister but could't find the courage.  So i waited until i got home and had a long conversation with my best friend who helped me decide what to do.  I rang the doctors myself and booked an appointement.  They asked me if i wanted to be refered to talk to someone so i said yes. The doctor weighed me there and i was just over 8 stone, proving i had an eating disorded.  I still felt terrible and didn't feel like i had help so i booked another appointement to see another doctor who then put me on anti-depressent tablets which i thought would help me eventually.  But it got worse.  In the meantime the first doctor refered me to talk to a therapist which i thought would help me and i felt good talking to someone else.  My therepist weighed me and i was about 7stone 8 pounds, the lowest i have ever been. I then weighed less than my sisters.  After about 7 sessions i felt low still and wanted my tablets to be raised to 3 a day instead of the usual 1 so he booked me in to see a physciatrist.  When i went the physciatrist told me that my pulse was slow, my skin was dry, my weight was 7 stone roughly and i was underweight for my height, which i knew already (5ft6inc).  She diagnosed my case as having anorexia nervosa and said that it is a life threatening illness which i must do something about now. She told me that i lost even more weight from when my therapist first weighed me and that i should go in the hospital to be refed, because of my age(16years) she gave me a month to try and do it myself, and to try and make a significant difference in my weight and if i dont then she will put me in the hospital.  I have untill the 6 of march and am finding it very hard.  I have frequently thought about putting myself in because it's too hard but i have to try for my mum, as do you! I have been stopped doing exercises which is killing me as it effects the thoughts on what i am eating.  I have to pull through because i just want to be me and not be ill anymore.Wish me luck! If anyone wants to talk and thinks i can help them then please e-mail me, you'd be surprised what talking to someone can do!

I'm studying singing at a very competitive school - focussing mainly on opera and song.  I'm trying so desperately to give up my eating habits and chose a healthier lifestyle. Sometimes I fall back into old habits, and this usually lasts a week. Other times I can keep my lifestyle balance and don't fall into the Bulimia Nervosa trap.   How much effect will my sickness have on my voice long term?  Will I be making irreversible damage?  
Hello everyone!  Before I start telling you 1 part of my story, I will apologize for my lackness of re-checking my spelling mistakes!  I just feel that I need to write it straight from the hart without paying attention on my spellings at the moment (I admit I am not a talent in spelling)  So I am a young 23 year old always worked hard ( since 12) and grew up with a fallen apart family. With this I mean that my parents got divorced when I was 9 and then my mother had to take care of 5 kids on her own.  Everyone was twat at that early age, I still respect my mom on how she managed to do it.  I deffinetly remember her breaking down points and those moments crushed my hart!  Seeing her cry cause her son is in jail again or her oldest daughter is missing for 3 days with bad friends.  I was yound still and walking around on streets on a early age searching for my sis!  I remember we had always fights in house, I just to lock myself in a room and pray so hard till it was quit again or it became worses.  I didn't like trying to fall asleep when my mom was yelling at my sister or older brother. But I had to cause I had to go to school the next morning and the to work.   Coming from school and then seeing a police car in front of the house would  make my hart go to my knees and I would turn white and runn to home thinking that something went wrong now.   So I kinda grew up in a lot of stress and anxiety environment.   At a age of 18 Things would get worse the fighting in the family become more and more. My dad was not involved with this because my parents were divorced but we still had contact with him.  I was graduating from High School with my best friend, who has experienced everything with me and lived near my family our whole youth. We would stick up for each other get each other in trouble or fix a job for each other at a restaurant or shop.   When I graduated I thought I need to live on my own and leave this environment so I went to search for possibilities and found a assosiaction that works with young people and help them build their lives offering them a house or room and help them through their financial stuff.  I was goiing to college at that time and had a little house/studio and was working 2 jobs. I loved it and felttt soooo happy untill.  I was foccusing on my self, it looked like puberty came at a later age around 19 and I was looking at my own image and felt like Hey I can controle that!  So I was allready a very sportive girl, but this time I through myself in it and ater living a year in my house It seemed like I turned Into partying, drinking, trying out drugs, getting into trouble with financial stuff and I was abussing myself by eating eating eating all my feelings away. And then I will never forget the first day I did it!  I came home after a bbq  and felt so sick and told myself whyyy whyyy amd I making myself so sickk!! So i Purged and I felt such a relieff!!   It didn't stick at that time I was turning 20 and it became worses first it was once a week , then it becames 3 times a week and soon it became every day somethimes, 3 times in 1 day.   I thought no I can control it whenever I want but soon I began to loose too many kilo's and my environment noticed but I kept my head high and said yeahh buddy I am working out!  My friend smeld something wrong and I thought S**ttt I can't controll thiss anymore and did tests online etc.   The moment when I told a teacher was when I started purging in school as well! I couldn't anymore! I was sick of hidding! I felt so lonely I couldn't share it with anyone I figured out that this had a reason from where it came from And that's my feelings not knowing how to process the past and continue on.  I never had a structered eating pattern when I was young never! We were happy when there was a meal at the end of the day.  But loosen from that After telling my teacher, she said look for help! I did and then I was trying to recover on my own only my friend knew.  21 i came back from summer break and was about to graduate I was also goiing to therapy and having 2 jobs.   the work load was much but for me it was like running away from beiing alone. My mindset was like ok stil 6 months and I have a degree come on push through you can do itt!!   At those last 6 months of college my father dies and I have to go and barry him! I go and do so with the whole family and even my friend comes along!  I began to think, Is life ever gonna be easier?? Is this a way of bringing the whole family together. Is this a way? Does someone has to die so we can all be with each other?  I finished those last 6 months at school and passed! but the proccesing of my fathers dead during those 6 months I had to do on my own!  I was isolating myself and arguiing with my best friend and she always takes it to the next level .. ussually I just walk away cause I know I can't winn a discuission with her she uses the right words and comes out to strong .  This time I was not taking anything of that so I punched her in the face and went off!  I know that I couldn't do that. I admit I was wrong by that action.  And I appoligized a few months later, but she held her pride high and I was not taking that either, so I just walked off this time and thought.  We have fought so many times spended a youth together you helped me barry my dad. And yet you still find a boyfriend which you meet  and date a  for 1 year  more important than having a soulmate/ friend for since we were 1 years old.   Now I am at uni, and still recovering allready did 2 months.  But this time a dark periode is coming along! I am feeling that black hole again. I am isolating myself starting to binge again not goiing to exams cause I haven't studied enough so I put more pressure on me to do it during a resit week with 1 change only!  I don't know were life is taking me and I always say to myself I will never give up, and I know I will not.   But I just can't work my ass off everytime and thinking it is gonna be allright one day?  I am tired and I am goiing to the wrong direction again!!  I started praying, and I know you need to be patient, but I come from a family without patience so I am trying to do diffrent!   What can I do I don't know were summer if taking me I have no new room/home and I need to find a way to pick myself up and pay off my debts and have a structure.   Please if there is anyone out there who can let me know that there are more people who are struggling and letting me know that there is hope!!   Please answer my first written topic! Any tips about it are welcome! 
Hi  I'm starting to have some physical problems from restricting calories and I was after some advice really. A couple of weeks ago I had a blood test and my pottasium was low so I had to have a drip.   I can't stop restricting myself so I was was wondering of anyone knows of any pottasium rich foods that are low calorie, bear in mind I see bananas as a top high calorie.  Thanks  
This is my first post. I have commented on other people's discussions but this is my first own post. It's harder than I thought!   I feel like i need to stop telling myself . . .I hate saying this. Here goes. Sometimes I think "I hate myself." and then I even think "No you don't. You're just pretending. You don't really think that. You're just trying to feel sorry for yourself. You're pathetic. Get over it" Like that's pretty much the train of thought. Sometimes it sounds so silly when you say it out loud but those moments where you think it, they're real.   Does anyone have any tips for moving on after therapy? (I did cognitive behavioural therapy.) Did anyone keep up the exercises? I think I might need to do that because I have found myself slipping back into my negative thinking unfortunately. And the worst thing is, I'm starting to believe it too.    I am trying to keep active though. I've done something with friends every day for the past few days. Even though I've been very bad with keeping my sleeping regularly. And I've stopped exercising for the last few days. Well actually I did go for a walk a couple of days, so I guess I have done some. But I was trying to do some everyday and I certainly haven't been doing that.   I want to start doing exercises to tone up my upper legs as well as I don't like my hips, thighs and stomach. I am trying not to slip into obsessive/dysfunctional exercising though as I have had some problems with my eating/exercise/body image up until very recently. As in, I'm still working on it. Yesterday I didn't eat from 1:30 until 10:30 except for two scoops of ice-cream. The day before I went to bed hungry. I keep feel like I'm eating all the time. I don't like to eat every time I'm hungry because I'm afraid I'll eat too much. There was another day I didn't eat most of the day between breakfast until a late dinner. I know I'm slipping right back. Even writing this is making me aware of it. I've been looking up BMI and all sorts. The truth is, I want to have a healthy idea of body image and a healthy attitude to food/weight/body image but there's this other side of me that wants to be on the bare minimum of the healthy BMI. I was losing weight to change my body but since I decided maybe all I need to do is target the areas I don't like with specific exercises because I used to do that (as well as cardio and a lot of other exercise) . . . and I used to like my body. Actually, that's a lie. Well, I used to like my body but I used to do all my exercise on the one day. 3 and a half hours in the evening. And instead of eating dinner that day, I used to eat 2 slices of brown bread and maybe an apple instead before all that exercise. I used to do 100 sit ups and some crunches every morning and 100 leg raises and 100 leg crunches (or whatever it's called) for each leg . . . That wasn't healthy either. Maybe I'm posting in the wrong place but it's all linked. The doctor says that's just a symptom of depression! Even though I never told him about all that because I've only just remembered/realised how wrong it was to behave like that.   I just want to be balanced but I find it very hard. I've always found it hard. The same with study. I either do nothing or go into complete overdrive/panic mode.   Sometimes I feel more anxious when I'm honest to myself about what's going on in my head. But I know that's better than keeping it all in  . . . does anyone have any tips for me please? I was about to say "apart from eat, sleep and exercise as I know that myself or therapy as it's not really an option" . .. why do I always have to deny myself of help? I know I need to eat, sleep and exercise to make me feel better. Why don't I just do it? I'm starting to feel anxious now. My tummy is starting to hurt. (Don't worry I did eat breakfast, a bowl of cereal. Even though I've identified recently that that's not enough to keep me going but I still continue to only eat a bowl of cereal for breakfast. I'm so frustrated at myself!!)  
Ok for the last few months I've been unable to keep up a healthy diet. I often eat one meal a day which sometimes I often do not finish. After that is a snack or 2 and then I'm done for the day. This caused problems with my periods, making them go all over the place, last too long or be more painful, or in most cases, stop for a few days and then start again. I have suffered a problem before when I had stomachaches after I ate but I didn't see a doctor about that and it went away after a month or so. I also had a problem with acidic things causing my stomach to hurt. Recently though, I refuse to eat a lot due to stomach aches, or constipation. I'll get constipation for a few days before finally being able to go, but due to the aches it causes, I tend to eat less. I've been to the doctor about it, and she says she thinks it's mental related. I have no care about my weight whatsoever and I blame it on the aches I get. My iron is low and so is my Folic acid. I wondered if anyone might know what's going on with these stomach pains, constipation and my lack of eating? I also feel weak a lot due to I don't tend to spend a lot of time outside. 
I have been battling with anorexia and bulimia for a year and a half now, and I just really wanted to share my thoughts and feelings about my recovery hoping some of you can relate.   I was diagnosed about a year ago when my family finally convinced me to get help. I've been in therapy since, but still battling with my eating disorder every day. I often feel extremely guilty about it, like this is all my fault, or that I'm doing this to myself. I know deep down that having anorexia isn't something that I would ever CHOOSE, in fact some nights I pray that I will wake up and be well again. But it will never happen like that, not without hard work. I want everyone to know that YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE THE EATING DISORDER - IT CHOSE YOU.  My ED voice has been winning most of the battles recently, and I've hardly eaten anything for the last week or so. I don't want to be unwell, and I'm trying so hard to fight this but I feel so out of control. Which is strange because some may say that I'm completely in control - in terms of controlling not eating. But I feel the opposite. I feel completely hopeless.  I want to be happy but I feel awful after everything I eat. One day I will feel free to eat what I like whenever I like without regretting every bite. And I'm going to fight hard to get there.  If anyone has anything to share, please post. And if you are reading this and able to relate, then know that you are not alone!  Keep fighting   Lucy x 
After researching this ethical subject I have many mixed opinion on whether anorexics should be forced fed. I understand that many consequences can arise from feeding against the patients will.  It would be interesting to gain opinions from anorexia patients and from friends and family, also health care professionals.  Thank you for your comments. 
i have been anerexic for the past 2 years and im worrying if i will become severly ill. 
My boyfriend is 23 years old, he has terrible eating habits and it worries me greatly what affect it is having on his current health and future health. I told him to speak to a doctor, to possible get referred to a dietician or nutritionist and the doctor point blank refused and said it was only for people who had health problems. Diabetes, is present in his family on his dad's side, his dad has type 2 and his grandmother has type 1 diabetes. He eats only the following things:  - Chips / Potatoes - Sausages - Bread - Bacon - Jam - Yorkshire Puddings - Burgers - Chicken - Sweets, Cakes and Chocolate  And that is all he eats, what he does eat is nearly always covered in ketchup as well. He doesn't not like or eat any vegetables. He does like a small selection of fruit but he doesnt eat it enough either way (but that's just laziness on his part). He does not like milk, cheese or butter (but does like yoghurts) however this means he nearly always doesn't eat breakfast as he wont eat cereal or toast. As he doesn't like butter the only sandwich that he eats is a jam sandwich. He eats a lot of chocolate and sweet things, which I feel is almost certain to lead to diabetes when he is older.   He often complains of stomach pains, which Im guessing is due to his digestive track struggling with the type of food he eats?  What I struggle to understand is he physically doesn't like the taste of the food, he is not being lazy and just not eating healthy food although more fruit and less chocolate would help I know. He is not afraid to try new food and he does want to be more healthy but he doesn't know how as he doesn't like the taste of so many things.  Is there anything that can be medically done or investigated, that could lead to helping him? Is it possible to have something wrong with your taste buds? If he increased his exercise would that counteract the lack of healthy diet, or at least reduce the affects of a lack of healthy diet?  Any advice on what to do, is gratefully appreciated. Feel free to ask any questions.   
I'm a 14 female, 5'1, and 100 pounds (healthy weight for my height). Over the past three months I have lost about 19 pounds. At first when it started I was eating around 400-500 calories a day and I dropped the majority of the 19 lbs by doing that. I then realized how unhealthy that was so I made an effort to eat more. I allow myself around 1400 calories a day and I ALWAYS count my calories. I won't eat something if I don't know how many calories are in it. I exercise every day and never have a meal above 400 calories. Luckily, I don't purge, but I do chew and spit sometimes. I'm really upset I've become so obsessive. I just want to be normal before this gets worse. What should I do? 
 So I had one today regarding my CTO,and the outcome is I'm staying on it.Im not very happy as one of the condition is for me to be at 50kg weight,but I lost already quite a bit and I'm worry they will recall me to hospital.I decided not to attend for any app and not to answer any phone call so I can do my own things.Im not happy with my weight and they can't force me to gain if I feel huge already.My question is can they came to my house and check on me or they will just leave me alone.I don't want to attend for any more appointment.Life has no sense for me...I'm hardly getting out of bed as my mood is so low so they should understand is hard for me to attend app.   I don't know what to to,I suppose to start work,but everything seems to much... 
For a couple of years now my girlfriend has made herself sick when she feels ugly or if she's eaten more than she thinks she should. At first I thought it was a one off thing but it became apparent that it happens often, I don't know exactly how often but somewhere between once a week and once a month. She has a history of anorexia and, I think to a lesser degree, self harm.  My initial reaction was to tell her off about it, that if she loved me she wouldn't do that to herself, I now know that this was completely wrong and since I've tried to be supportive.   She hides it from me, being sick after she's asked me to go to the shops etc, but if I catch her she becomes overwhelmed with self loathing and becomes very defensive. Last night she blamed me for ruining our evening when I came home and smelt sick. I know I can't challenge her over this but I can't ignore the problem either.  She is a slim (BMI of 19 or so) 35 year old. At the moment I do not think her problem is dangerous to her health. She snacks on pretzels and cheese or prepared foods from the local convenience store rather than eating regular cooked meals and would quite happily continue eating after she has been sick.  She says the feeling she gets from eating too much makes her want to hurt herself and the only way to alleviate that feeling is to be sick.   She also gets very upset if she perceives that she has eaten more than me.   My biggest worry is that she makes no attempt to get better. We have talked about controlling her eating habits but if I don't enforce these measures she carries on as before and I don't want to have to be in charge of what and when she eats. When I try to talk to her she tells me there's nothing I can do and that I should accept her being sick every now again. She says that if I stop her being sick the result is she would hurt herself. I struggle not to see this as emotional black mail. I also worry about the extent of her problem, she actively tries to hide it from me, what if she is sick multiple times a week?  I am looking for advice on the following:  1. How do I talk about this without it becoming a confrontation? 2. Should I take active measures to fight her problem (i.e. denying her snacks and forcing better eating habits)? 3. What help is there I/we/she can get to try and move forward and get passed this? 4. I do not think her health is in immediate danger, should I be less worried than I am? 
for a while now, I've been feeling like i might have an eating disorder. i've always been a fussy eater, and for a while have noticed that i'm constantly thinking about food during the day. when i get home from school, no-one is home, which gives me the perfect opportunity to eat loads of food, but i feel really guilty about it afterwards, although I've never made myself sick after I've eaten. recently, I've noticed just how thin i am, and it's making me paranoid. i think that everyone is constantly thinking about how thin i am when they look at me. it's really getting me down, as i want to get help and get better, but i don't really know who to talk to as i don't have a good home/family situation at the moment.  what should i do???? please help!!! 
Every time I see food on the stove or in the lunch line I don't feel like I can eat it because it just doesn't look appealing. A family member insisted that I eat some Chinese food they bought last night and I made a bowl and I couldn't eat all of it and I didn't even get a lot of it. I tried to eat more of it but it made me really uncomfortable and I got really upset over it so I stopped and put it in the fridge. Before last night I hadn't eaten anything 3 days prior. I'm not sure why I don't seem to be able to enjoy food even when I know I need it. 
I'll start off by saying I'm not overweight. I'm 137 lbs (9st,11lb) and 5ft 3in, with a BMI of 24.3. All of which is normal for my age. However, I have noticed that I've gained a little wait recently, (although this isn't noticible to other people) I can tell as some clothes are starting to feel a little tighter than they did a few months ago. It is now getting closer to summer, and I would like to have some of my favourite clothes fit me as they shoud. Also I'm planning to go to on holiday in August, and so would like to tone up a bit before then.  My diet isn't that bad.. I make most of my meals from scratch, and none are particularly rich meals full of fat. I only occasionally have meals that may contain a lot of calories, but this doesn't often go above 600 at any mealtime. I rarely eat sweets or crips, and have managed to cut down on chocolate and cake (which I eat less of than I used to anyway). Plus nearer to summer, I'll eat less of these due to the warm weather making me opt for cooler and fresher things.    I rarely eat sausages and other meats high in fat. I mostly eat chicken for every evening meal nowadays. I've  also not had a microwaveable readymeal/instant noodles/packet pastas etc. in months, because I've been making more meals myself.  So my downfall? I eat a lot of food. My portion sizes are probably almost twice a normal portion size, and I can eat it all, then be craving something sweet 15 minutes later and not even feeling remotely full or like I've just eaten a meal up to half an hour later. I don't snack much, but I do generally eat 4 meals a day, with the first and last being light meals. And despite liking salads and vegetables, I don't like to have them consist as the largest part of my plate because I'll still feel hungry afterwards. I know it's something to do with my stomach having been trained to hold that much, but it's the way I've been brought up. We are a family of propper portion sizes, and I'm known by my friends and family as someone who can eat like a machine.  Now I know people's immediate thoughts would be to eat more carbs.. well, I did that, and nothing. I don't think I eat as much carbs as I used to, mainly because I'm trying to cut down on gluten. At one point, I was trying to up my fibre intake, so I bought a lot of wholegrain foods; pasta, bread, cereal. And because these foods were wholegrain/wholemeal, it's healthier than eating white alternatives, therefore I ate a lot of it.   In one day I would eat on average, 4 slices of wholemeal bread (as a sandwich and maybe toast before bed if I was hungry), a bowl of wholegrain cereal (such as plain/ honey shreddies etc.) and maybe wholegrain pasta for my evening meal, sometimes something else. So I consumed A LOT of wholegrains. Sure I  upped my fibre intake, and sure it was a healthier option than white bread or pasta, but it was still carbs. And I was eating it too often. The presence of carbs in my diet got that bad, that I actually didn't know what I could possibly eat if I cut out carbs altogether. Of course I wouldn't do that, but it was a scary thought.  Anyway, the reason I feel I eat less carbs now and mostly why I'm trying to cut down on gluten, is because I noticed that I had started suffering from heartburn a lot more. It was becoming a daily occurence at least once a day, and something that was beginning to worry me. I've always had bouts of heartburn every now and again, I guess it's just something I've inherited from my parents (they get it sometimes). But it came to the point where I could NEVER be without Rennie to hand. I also noticed that I seemed to get heartburn whenever I ate something that was wholegrain/wholemeal. I then came to the conclusion that these being a purer form of wheat than white (?), that perhaps the now high-wheat content in my diet had something to do with it.   Since cutting down on the gluten, I've eaten less bread and pasta, and I don't eat that many potatoes either. I've also started buying things such as quinoa, and other things that are either gluten free, or obviously don't contain that much. Since I went almost a week with little to no gluten in my diet, I had no outbreaks of heartburn for 5 days straight (until I ate a pre-made sandwich).  I still have sweet cravings, which I can sometimes curb with homemade gluten-free, chocolate orange fruit and nut bars (like the Nak'd ones). I'm not sure if I do have an intolarance to wheat as I've never gotten ill from it, just bad heartburn whenever I eat too much. The same goes for tomato based dishes and orange juice    I've also started going swimming a couple of times a week where I'll do on average 14 lengths of the pool in about an hour, and go to 1 or 2 exercise classes a week. Also when I'm at home in the holidays (I'm a student) I'll work on average 4-5, 8 hour shifts a week where I'm on my feet for almost the whole shift.  I know most of this post is probably slightly irrelevant, but I don't feel like there is anything I can do to actually make me stay full.  I can get full sure.. as long as I eat a plate full of food. But the problem is it doesn't stay that way for any longer than about 20 minutes. I don't eat much junk food so It can't be that I'm not eating the right foods. I think I just love food too much.    
I'm Anorexic and I have been detained under MHAct since 28.08.13.Im out of hospital but under CTO.My ED is getting worst but I have to lie to my CPN that I'm coping.Mentaly maybe I was but 2 weeks ago I stopped taking my meds and my depression is getting out of control. I'm seeing my CPN next week but I'm so scared to admit I'm not taking my meds.My question is can they send me back ip if I'm not taking meds?I don't want to tell them that I'm struggling with food and waterloading before weigh in.I just want to avoid ip but I know I can carry on like this.Dont know what to do.... 
i can never eat without feeling guilty. All though im a size 8 i look in the mirror and see this massive fat blob. every time i eat i want to rewind time and starve a little longer. I hate feeling this way! I want to not care about gaining weight, i want to enjoy food! I can hear anorexia calling me! I have in the past gone through a month of bulimia, i stopped as i still felt guilty after throwing up! I want to be a normal teenager! Ever since the age of 10 ive been calculating calories and checking i havent gained weight. i cry every time a size 8 feels tight. My mum doesnt understand, Nobody understands. I have no one to turn to. I need help and especially now as i feel myself getting worst! I want to be normal, to think like a normal teenage girl! 
Hi there i have been suffering from anorexia for about 4 months now, admitted to hospital back in november 2013 with a heart rate as low as 18 at night and 22 through out the day. I was in the heart ward for a week in intensive care, then transferred to adolescent for 4 weeks. I was let out a day before christmas, then had to attend an outpaitent app a week later to then be re admitted for 3 weeks. I was finally discharged with a stable normal heart rate and 10kg heavier. Things have been tough but okay since being out, i have good and bad days. However the past week i have started binging on everything, hungry all the time finding myself eating sooo much  is this normal? I have also thrown up a few times, not sure if its my body has over eaten or what. I had the urge to force myself last night from feeling so sick. Am i bulimia now? is this a bad thing? please help!   
Hi i have some weride eating disorder. i have a fear of around 90% of food and i fell sick when i put fmost food in my month   I have been having nightmares about dieing young or having a heart attack  i have invested in a juicer. to juice fruit and vegables as the skin of most fruits make me ill  but i have not managed to juice vegitables but i'm thinking of this to help me in my life  To do serval fruits in one drink with 1 or 2 pices of vegetables to help get me other stuff  and as the pulp contains the firbre and i cant eat that without felling sick i'm thinking of baking it into cakes with low sugar so that its more heathy and i get that diety firbre  is there any advise you can give me   
I have always been overweight even as a young teenager (but I was not as big as I am now)   Also I have a history of depression, anxiety and PTSD  Recently in the last two weeks I have begun throwing up every meal, especially if I have binged or  gorged on meals, I want to be a mental health nurse so I know this isn't right but I feel so much better when I purge or vomit my food out.  Am I becoming bulimic or is this just me being over-reactive  Any advice or help would be appreciated  
but don't know what to do   I have hypothyroidism too which doesn't help, but when I'm low, bored or alone, I tend to binge eat junk food and my weight is getting to be a serious concern.  The problem is I'm a 31yr old male and I don't think anyone will take me seriously.  I'm not sure weight watchers classes, self-help groups and that kind of thing are really going to benefit me, but I'm just not sure what help I can get or who will listen.  I'm so worried which doesn't help, but I just don;t know what to do or where to turn 
One of my friends kid is having a problem like, he will eat continuously. Post medical examinations doctors confirmed that there is no cure for that.  The kids age is 2 years. Could any doctor educate us on this or share the treatment details if you are already treating / treated such kind of kids will be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance. 
My bulimia started just a few months ago.  I'm not sure if I'm really bulimic because I don't have the time to consult pro's and I'm still a student that's why I can't afford to pay for a checkup. I think I'm disciplined and I don't eat fatty foods.. I only eat oats,milk , breads or sweet potatoes& something like super yummy boiled veggies. BUT sometimes I over eat ( breads) and whenever I over eat I feel like throwing up(and I do throw up)  I don't want to get fat that's why i'm doing that...  I'm aware that if I binge eat, I might get some disease but I can't avoid it. today, my friend asked me to go to her birthday. because she's my friend I can't say no to her. I end up eating her favorite fatty unhealthy foods. I was so scared when I got home. I vomit again. I don't want to do that again . but how can I stop it? to be honest I'm only 17yrs old. I still don't know what to do if I get sick because of this. my family is not aware and I'm to ashamed to tell them.. 
I am 14 years of age and one of my legs, my left leg, appears to be completely malnourished. My right leg however is in a perfectly normal condition, and i am able to feel the muscles inside my right thigh. On my left leg, there is literally no muscle in it and it is practically bone. As you can tell i am very scared at this moment and i am desperate for some help and advice. My question is that how am i able to gain weight on my left leg? Or is it a problem with my metabolism or something inside of my body that is preventing my left leg from gaining any weight at all? What i can say is that, this may sound strange, but i eat very fatty foods regularly and have regular things to eat at dinner and tea times. Also i do not eat any meat other than sausages and the chicken from the likes of McDonalds and KFC, which i feel may have an affect on this. I am not exaggerating when i say that my left leg itself is most definitely anorexic, and my right leg is perfectly normal. Please help me as i have been living with this problem for over a year and finally decided to express it with you on here. 
I'm 20 years old and I'm in my first year at university, my first year away from family and friends I've had around me for years. I am petrified. I'm almost about to go home and I am still just so scared of everything.  I was scared about making new friends, and even though I actually made some, my addiction to lying has hurt them. It's hurt me. I've been progressively picking and stealing small amounts of food from them over the year, then denying any involvement in it whatsoever. And I can't even understand why I do it? And not only do I take something that's not mine, I throw it back up anyway.  I am so disgusted. They are disgusted with me. I can't believe my lies and my bulimia have cost me this much. Because I am not that person. I don't mean to hurt people, steal from them or lie to them. And I can't expect them to understand my disorder either. Their first reaction being 'you can't have bulimia, my friend had an eating disorder and she was stick thin and never ate'. I'm sorry I'm not skeletal enough for you, but I am infact baring my soul to you. I wish you could see how difficult this is.  Them reacting so aggressively has made me realise quite the state I've got myself in to. I have spent today confessing to my closest friends, my Mum, my Dad, and my younger sister. I have cried for hours. I have been honest to them about my deepest fears and my deepest wish to recover. I've called out for help today, and although I'm still crying, I feel so relieved that I am finally on the road to recovery. I do not want to be the secretive, confused person I was yesterday. I do not want to lie. I want to get better.  I desperately want to get better. I'm approaching this out of desperation and love for my family, but I'm still so scared of the changes to my lifestyle and my body once I begin eating properly. Coping with the anxiety is going to be near unbearable. I guess I just have to keep the memory of my little sister sounding so grown up on the phone, crying but telling me that 'we'll get through it together', 'we're a team and I love you'  My binges and purges were sometimes as bad as 5-6 times a day, luckily I've had no massive side effects but I think I've been massively lucky. I didn't purge once today, and I feel fantastic for doing so.   I don't know whether anyone else connects with this? It's not so much a story or a question so much as a massive confession and apology. Wish me luck with my recovery!  
hi, i spent a few months in a psych hospital (and a general hospital) for my anorexia, depression, anxiety, self harm, emetophobia and frequent suicide attempts. i feel like im slipping back to my old ways and im actually starting to MISS hospital?!? i hated so much when i was in there, but my social situations in the ''normal'' world are even worse.  i still see a number of doctors etc weekly, as im 16 and under the mental health act. its just i dont know.. i feel so fat now, i would rather have all the other problems back again- including being in a wheelchair, tube fed, daily; blood pressure/heart rate/ texture checks. is it normal to miss this? im so lonley and all the suicide thoughts are getting strong again, i just wanted people opinions on my situation? like normal people, not doctors.. 
I have been bulimic on and off over the last 30 years...started when I was 20 and am 51 now. I know its me mainly trying to control my weight gain.... but whenever I have emotional stresses and things not going as planned.... I just lose it... I have a spell of just bingeing and throwing up and laxatives for a few weeks and things calm down and I feel ok and happy... I have had long spells of psychotherapy...was effective in the sense that I thought I was cured for nearly 3 years and it started again as the scales tipped more and more... Like everyone else on here... I do realise its so damaging for my health.... (last 11 years have lived on my own.)..so bingeing and purgeing hasnt been a problem...no one knows.... now I am in a relationship and it may not be that easy throwing up and getting away with it .. and I feel a little better for it ..thinking I might stop because there is someone else around who I care for... and dont want to worry and cause him concern.... I feel positive at the moment... AND I wish it really STOPS! 
I'm 25 and ive been suffering with bulimia for about 4 years. Over the past year its become a daily occurance that i binge and purge. Every day i tell myself that i will work on kicking it but never happens. What are the first steps to recovery?   Thanks in advance

Hi! My name is Nan. I am not English speaker, but please I need your help.  Iâm 23 years old now. I have had Bulimia since I was 14 years old & I stopped vomiting at 20. 6 years of my life I stuck my fingers down my throat 15-20 times per day. The question is I think my face is bigger than I should be. I mean I did it when I was so young.  Would my fingers expand my face shape? Would it make my face bigger? I did it very young & My body didnât fully develop as an adult. I see the dental braces can shape the teeth so why my finger couldnât expand my face shape? Please I need an answer. Someone please help. I worry about it very much. Thank you in advance!  THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I was put on medication before, but couldn't keep on taking them because they caused me severe insomnia, I take mirtazapine now to help me sleep,, someone give me some advice please.. is there anything I can do to help myself? 
I have checked my BMI and it says im at 16.12, im 22 yrs old, 5ft7 and weighing just under 7 an a half stone. I have been told im under weight during a check up a couple if months ago due to another health problem. Nothing els was said about my weight. I have metnioned it to doctors in the past when seeing about other medical issues but the subject seems to change. I get hair loss and have noticed i have been eating less due to feeling sick after eating or to the point i cant eat alot due to feeling sick. I get cold very easy. I can stand outside for an hour and my whole body shakes and its come to the point once where i have gotten chest pain from feeling so cold. If its summer i still get cold skin even if i feel hot. I have been tol my hands become freezing even if its summer. Anyone think i have anorexia? I would just like peoples opinions before taking it further. thank you 
i am anorexic and bullimic, i starve myself all day and if i do eat it will be a cup of soup which i will still force myself to be sick, i take diet pills and am obsessed with exercising, i think about food all day, my skin is starting to turn really bad-even though i always take multivitamins, my stomach hurts all the time an even now all i can do is just think about eating.  I know i have brought all these problem on myself so im not looking for any sympathy or anything like that- im just giving you abit of insight to what it might be like or even still just reaching out to anyone who feels just like me.  The worst thing is after all these big or small problems i may have-i still do not wish to stop-i am not overly skinny-but i do wish to be-  I have friends that are quite chubby and fat but they are happy with what they have and that is the difference- I AM NOT- I DO NOT LIKE WHAT I SEE!  and yes i have problems and issues but at least i can admit it,  im not looking for people to feel sorry for me so please do not start slagging me off-it would be probably just make people like me feel worst-and some we to just need to let it all out,its hard when you have to keep all this S*** to yourself.  so thanks..

Hi I'm very scared I don't really know what to do I had bulemia for 6 years then stopped ended up putting weight on but wasn't happy met a man whom I'm marrying next month he knows about my past but its started again I was 11stone 8 eight months ago now I'm 8stone 3 I make myself sick every single time anything passes my lips I can't stop now I'm so scared he will find out because he's worried now and tells me every day I need to put weight on but I'm scared to get fat I don't see my self as slim I still see myself as being big please can anyone advise what I can do  
Hi everyone, I'm completely new to this forum - I've never used a health forum or psychiatric support forum before. I think I've been too scared because when so many of the people close to you judge you, attack you or abandon you because of your mental illnesses, it's hard to believe that total strangers won't do the same thing.  Anyway, I just wanted to introduce myself as I hope to have the confidence to use this forum as an outlet for all the awful stuff I keep bottled up inside, which causes me to hurt myself so badly. I'm in my early 20s, and I've suffered from bulimia for just over 6 years now. I have a few other serious psychiatric conditions (I became ill when I was 12 & went through a trauma) including OCD, Borderline Personality Disorder, & a history of psychotic episodes. Self-harming in various ways kind of runs my life, as do certain compulsive behaviours & I feel like I'm trapped in this life sometimes.  As regards my eating, which is what I'm really here to talk about, the bulimia kind of goes in cycles - from mild, right round to severe & then back. I don't know if that makes any sense? At the moment I can feel it spiralling out of control again into the really severe stage. I am terrified to eat- actually have anxiety attacks any time I have to eat (i.e. at family meals, or out with friends so they don't pick up on the fact I'm trying to limit my food intake) I'm so mixed up - I feel guilty if I do eat, and then I feel guilty about starving myself & making myself throw up after I eat, or taking lots of laxatives. I just wanted to know I have a place to come to vent about some of this stuff because I'm suffering so much & I can't do this on my own.  
I was referred to the eating disorder clininc and attended my first appointment today which was 1.5 hrs of questions. I have binged and made myself sick on and off for 15 years now but just lately is the worst its ever been. I have in the past done the cambridge diet (which is no food at all) and lost lots of weight and then put back on since Christmas I have put on 4 stone and am really suffering which is why I went for help! Well at the appointment she said I think you will benefit from a 6 week course of binge eating group therapy, now I dont actually agree with this firstly my job wont allow me 3 hrs off each week for 6 weeks secondly its not local and I just think I need more, what are your thoughts? 
Hey, Im 19 and have recently spoken to my doctor and anxiety disorder. I think i ve had spells of this since i was 15 and main symptom is having a poor appitite, as i girl ive always worried about my weight, but this symtom has come back and it feels worse than it has done before. I do eat, i dont starve myself bt i eat less and less, but cant make myself eat things...if this makes sense. Would like some peopel who feel maybe on the same level to have a chat to, as its worrying me. i cant keep going through phases like this, can i? 
i constantly eat in secret as much as i can before being with  my friends. all my friends think i eat really healthy as they seee me eating salad and fruit at lunch but whilst in the community i will stop at shops buying two and three chocolate bars and eat them all at once. i constantly crave food from bread to fruit to crisps/ chocolate basically whatever i can get my hands on when i am by myself. i know its wrong and feel rubbish whilst doing it and even worse afters, i have bougght chocolate as a gift for someone else and then eaten it myself 
I was a bulimic for over 5 years and have now not binged or purged for over 15 years. There is hope :D During my worst period I was also purging at least once a day and felt so helpless to stop I was suicidal. I did go and see a psychologist and therapist and lucky for me the therapist was the right fit - If you have not found yours yet, keep looking!! I was diagnosed with manic depression and was put onto a course of anti-depressants. It took months to work through the issues and I obtained some tools to stop myself from starting the spiral into negative thinking that then leads to the bulimic behaviour. I do still 'snack' frequently, but like one of the other postings mentioned, exercising helps keep my weight and bad food feelings under control. I believe that everyone has addictions, some are more harmful than others and we all need to figure out what the triggers are for us individually in order to control our (sometimes distorted) thoughts. Please do not feel alone and do not feel guilty (of course this doesn't help stop the habit, but makes it worse) - like I said everyone has their issues, it just comes out differently in different people. Keep looking for the solution that will help you...it is out there! 
somehow reading these posts made me feel less alone  if that makes sense? 
I am 16 years old and have been diagnoised with bulimia. I find its really hard to tell people you have this condition as they immediatley think you are some kind of freak and are completly different from everyone else.  I began making myself sick when i found out my granddad had a terminal illness and found it to be helpful in relieving my stress.  When i look back now i think how stupid i was but when you start you find it so hard to stop yourself.  As a student studying for my GCSE's i think it would be soo much easier for people like myself to tell others if conditions like these were taught more in school and made more aware of.  Problems like these are more common that you would think.  I have not made my self sick for over a year now but find it really hard when i become stressed or ill.  Now i have turned to exercise as a way of getting rid of stress which isnt the best idea but is better than the vominting.  I would say to anyone my age if you believe you have some kind of illness like Bulimia or Anorexia dont keep it to yourself as thats the worst thing you can do.  Just tell someone you are worried about this and get help as soon as possible as it only becomes worse and tries to take over your life.  But dont let it! 
I was referred to  a Counsellor.  I didn't know what to expect and I was very scared, although I wouldn't admit it!  I had to learn how to talk about my feelings, and how to cry, and it took me a long time before I could trust her, but everything was done at my pace, there was no pushing, if I didn't feel like talking I didn't have to.  i don't believe I would be here now if it hadn't been for her. 
hello i am bulimic have been for about 8 years i get to the size am comfortable then stop because im happy, then put all the weight back on then start again usually for about 6 to 9 months at a time. I feel fat in a slimish body. I went to my doctor for help which was really embarrasing and he told me that there was no help available and sent me to see a nutritionist to tell me what foods i should eat. Well i dont know about you but i know what foods are good for me and i know what portions are good for me.The doctor told me there is nothing to do because of the way i do it for periods at a time. Is my case not impotant? what makes it important? because i know what iam doing to my body its not healthy!

hi everyone I'm a girl af almost nineteen years old. I have been bulimic for more then three years. I still am. I'm in my first year of college, I study interior architecture, it has always been my dream! But I never thought that I would still be bulimic, I thought everything would be fine if I went to college. I don't know what to do anymore, I need help, I think it's horrible what I do to my body. In the past I already went to doctors and I went to the psychiatrist but I stopped going because I found it useless and it was really expensive. It means my parents knew about my problem (I told them after I was really really down ) . My mother was devastated, she didn't understand. Later I told her everything is fine with me , and that I don't purge anymore. She still thinks I am but I'm absolutely not, I don't want to ask for help because I don't want to tell her, it'll break her heart and I want to study and finish college and not go to doctors or hospitals. I'm looking for people to talk to, who deal with the same problems lots of kisses x 
Hi, I ate loads of food yesterday, and everytime i did, I had to lock myself in the toilet and cry.  I would get an urge to eat, but not out of control grabbing for mamoth amounts.  Just little bits here and there.  Everytime, id sit on the toilet grabbing my arms and just sobbing.  I dont wnt to be doing anything silly with my food.  Food is a need , we need food to live, Its not like alcohol, we can drink or not drink, - but we do not need it to survive, or walk or do the every day things in  life or to just think clearly.  By nightime, i had 2 small slices of pizza which was full of fat.  I dont like to eat after 5 pm and when I do I grab for the laxatives.  yet m iknow these things dont help as you r body just absorbs the fat, but I think I look better if I can get rid of what I can...( Its not even that I think I am fat, i am just simply uncomfy with , in my body)..  I cant talk to peopl properly about it.  My mum is very thin,my sister very thin,, even my dad is very thin. They show no sign of having problems.  theres me, curvy and tired all the time.  When I feel guilty or das i tend not to eat and find it extremly difficult, evem end up throwing my cocolate biscuits out.  It sways from one end to the other.  before my period is due, i have a need to eat . So Ido.  But once I have it , I dont have this need, and find it even more difficult to eat during this time.  I am worried.  I am worried as |I am lloosing my ability to focus on the things I should be focused on. I am worried as I am soon going to on my own with my 2 children and all I amteaching them is how to self destruct.  I am more worried that I have made a huge catchh 22 catastrophe, as laxatives are surely bound to make you fat rather than thin as your body looses its natural metabolic base and desperately grabs the bad fats instead of absorbing the good stuff to get the bad stuff out.    I am so confused about my ill understanding of what I am doing to myself, i dont want to be doing this.  i am scared I am going to get the urge to throw up , but I have a thing about being sick.  Ill do anything not to puke.  I never thought myself a vain person.  I never thought i would ever be doing what I do or even be worried about it.  I just cant get a grip and to be honest I dont understand, am I just being anxiou, and this is nothing to worry about,.  I am confused, 
Well where do i start, i have always been un happy about my weight, and i was always teased as a child and called fat. I still get told now that i am a little chubby! i am only a size 10 but i must admit i do see myself a lot bigger, i used to make myself sick after certain foods, but recently i have been making myself sick after everything i eat.  I am a mother of 2 and think since having my children i have become worse. I am only 21 and things are starting to become worse as i now have to read everything on the back of packets and i am constantly thinking about food.  I don't want any sympathy as i know what i am doing is very wrong and selfish but after i am sick i feel alot better and i still get the satisfaction of tasting good food.  I always think that i will be able to stop myself but things are definately getting worse. I talk to close friends about this as they are very understanding which does help a lot. I am not ashamed of what i do and do not hide it, as i think it helps me that my friends close to me understand how i feel, obviously they don't approve.  Thank you for letting me talk about my own experiences. 
OK well i'm not one to admit having any problems... why? because i'm a perfectionist. Maybe thats why (at 5'2\&quot i only weighed 94 lbs when i was 14  However i WILL admit to having Bulimic tendencies. When i was 14 i purged for the first time. In the beginning i'd only purge after consuming ice cream, and i never REALLY threw up any large quantity of food.   Over the course of a year i probaby only purged about two to three dozen times, and for a while i stopped entirely.   But then once i turned 16 i started purging again. NEVER binging though. or taking laxatives. Nothing too serious. But after puring only a few times a month, infrequently, my condition got worse. I'd make myself throw-up every night. However, this lasted for only about a month or two. Because although i'd feel guilty about eating, i'd feel guilty while standing bent over in the shower while shoving my fingers down my throat.  Then, this past spring, i met someone really special. We made a deal together; i would stop purging and he would stop popping pills. Then, whenever one of us slipped up, we had to tell the other person.  Since i made the deal, i've only purged about a dozen times. The last time i did was early june. I wouldn't like to classify my disorder, but if i had to, i'd say i was a recovering bulimic. Because addictions are usually impossible to get over 100% 
im 16, i got diognosed with anorexia/bulima when i just turned 15, at first i restricted my food intake ever so slightly until it got the point of full blown starvation, my hair was falling out, numerous fainting spells, blurred vision, periods stopping for months, very high mood swings, and feeling dperessed 24/7 was pretty much of what life consisted of.  I lost all contacts with freinds having fun which is what most 16 years olds do isnt it? But i didnt care the disease telling me i was fat was more important all i cared about was becomming thinner.  3 months down the line a vicious circle of throwing up everyday from 7 - 10 times a day began, using upto 20 laxative a day also became hell. I used to be a happy clever girl, confident and enjoyed life socalising but all of that seemed to have dispearred.  i was nearly 9 stone beofore my eating disorder bombarded my mind with negative thoughts about myself, i dropped to 5 stone 11 with a feeding tube down my nose, one day it clicked i need to get out of hospital and i did i thought it would go away unfortunatly i still struggle however maintaining a low healthy weight. However because of this i cant enjoy food the ay i used to if you think about it food is one of the most important essentials in a persons life its pretty much controls what you do, without food your unable to do the things you enjoy most, most of all the disease takes over and controls everything to do with the food, sometimes i never realised what i did until afterwards i had thrown up its strange how something which sounds easy (but i promise really isnt) can ruin your life and education. 
I'm bulimic.   I've been builimic for 24 years (over half of my life!).   I went on to develop bulimia after suffering from anorexia, which I still very occassionally relapse into.  I think the longest time I have managed to be bulimic free is probably 6-8 months.  When I was pregnant my bulimia became manic, espescially in my 2nd &amp; 3rd trimester.  Thankfully my child was born healthy, but the ammount of guilt that I still carry is unbelievable (even 15 years on).  Thankfully my child is a very rounded, happy &amp; together individual.  I find relationships extremely difficult to form (whether platonic or physical), I can't allow anyone to get close, I live under the pretence that I'm just too busy to fit it in.  I'm not daft, I'm repulsed by myself &amp; fear rejection (abusused past &amp; not the perfect 'dolly' my mother expected!).  I'm having an immense self-hatered day today, I feel chunky, ugly &amp; worthless (so bad was unable to go out the door), but I'm trying to break the binge &amp; puke cycle AGAIN! So I have it to go through until I'm back on the straight &amp; narrow.  The only probem now is trying to avoid relapsing back into anorexia, as I'm trying to control my eating so not to binge!  I desperatley want to get off this visious rounderbout &amp; one day I WILL be free of my eating dissorders.  The daftest thing is 24 years on &amp; nobody still has a clue.    Children are precious, protect them, listen to them, support them but most importantly allow them to develop into the people that they are - not who you expect them to be x
