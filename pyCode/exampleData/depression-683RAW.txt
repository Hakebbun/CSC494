I have been on this site. I do not hear from people who over came depression and how? 
Hi all,  I have been using Nytol one a night for about 2 years with small breaks during this time due to losing my best friend and had always had so much trouble at a young age around 15-16 when I lost both my parents within a year of each other.  I went to the doctors at the start about my sleep but I didn't want anything my body would or could get addicted to and have to withdrawl. He gave me a weeks worth of sleeping tablets and of I went. Didn't go back to see him for a year as I found :  Nytol my savour for helping me sleep. They were brillant for me, I am not a drug user nor will I ever be as I just don't have any interest in them but I have tried some drugs but only once or twice usally when I am totally drunk.  Anyway back to the Nytol, brillant took 1 a night for months worked brillant. Eventually as all things, it was coming to an end, 1 tablet wasn't working. Started to take 2. I was tottally oblivious to any danger if I was to take too much eventually it will end badly. I just thought "its sold over the counter, they is obviously nothing dangerious or anything to worry about".  Also when speaking to friends or my doctor he just said continue to take nytol whilst im on anti depressaints to help me sleep. This was 2 months ago he persribed me citalopram 20mg a day. I had to come of it because the side effects were just awful.  Currently now on Propanolol for aniexty more social than anything never really had panic attacks. He said same again, just continue nytol and try and come of them slowly over time. So I had told my doctor a year and a half later that I am still on nytol but I currently take 4-6 a night, I take 4 before bed and If that doesn't work I take 1/2 throughout an hour or 2 until I fall asleep.  So with taking 40mg 1-3 times a day of propanolol I felt calmer and didn't mind going to shops etc were as before I would always avoid and beg my girlfriend to go lol. So it was working brillant but I was still not happy due to depression I felt will be asking doctor for advice when I see him in 2 weeks.  So back to nytol my sleeping pattern was so bloody bad recently like waking up at 5pm and sleeping at 8am. Which made me more depressed so I once against incrased the Nytol dose to get to sleep sooner. I have never ever experienced anything like this in my life alone side the propanolol because I had been taking 6-8 tablets per night a few times and nothing happened. With the propanolol the last few nights I had been getting visual distorations like clear squiggles that looked like it was bending the air and distorting everything behind it (if that makes any sense). Had that for a few nights didn't think anything was wrong I just thought it was because I hadn't slept in so long. I could also see like particlies and very small things bumping and jumping making the floor look like it was vibrating. Feel asleep eventually and repeated this for a week or so.   Until Last night I genuinely thought I was about to die I was seconds away from passing out and I scared the sh*t out of my poor girlfriend. I was getting the usal distorations in my vision and I had ended up taking 11 nytol pills last night without even realising, as I was supposed to wake up early today and go out with friends and go to the xmas market as we do it around this time every year. So I was worrying about the time and I just wanted to get to sleep ASAP so I could be fresh for waking up early and head out!  I was beginning to see things move that just weren't moving and I knew something was up, I could see my blanket they shapes when I went into like a day dream state everything was moving and looked as if flys or something were stuck in the bedsheets/blanket buzzing inside trying to get out. (the best way I can desribe it) I also was seeing splashes of water on my walls that just kept moving and seeing things in the corner of my eyes but when I looked it was gone.  Then suddenly bam, my heart just went bloody nuts I instantly felt as if I was about to pass out I quickly lifted my head and made sure I landed on my girlfriend beside me incase I passed out and I just shouted "there's something wrong with me" and burst into tears.  Luckily I didn't pass out but my heart was still sore and buzzing. I don't have panic attacks often its like once or twice a year and with taking propanolol I was always calm. No panic attack felt like this before and I rang the out of hours doctor and told me it was prob a panic attack speak to ur own doctor when you can.   After my girlfriend just holding me stroaking my head (which wasn't helping it was making me feel so sick) but I didn't want to upset her even more. I finally moved and said I need to stop this I know theres something wrong with me I need to stop taking med's I didn't have any problems before I started the meds. I looked over at the nytol packet I had bought the night before and out of a packet of 20 there was 9 left.I instantly thought to myself, "what the hell?! I don't even remember taking that many" as soon as I saw that I bolted to the toilet and dry heaved for a few minutes so worried I was going to die my heart still wasn't feeling right and I was scared I was overdosing so I thought screw this I am not waiting for something to happen and fired my fingers to the back of my throat to throw everything up as I did no want to go near a hospital incase they thought It was a sucide attempt which they would with recent anti depressiants and propanolol. I will NEVER touch nytol again. I forgot to mention (this is strange and hard to explain) I was getting after all the panic and the store chest and after throwing up 10mins later I was getting cold sensations of blood throw in my arms and legs. The best way I can desribe it, it was like someone was injecting cold blood into my arms and legs and it was like a shooting sensation that would start at the top of my arms and legs and work its way down and start at the top and work its way down again. There was no pain just a strange feeling??  I am so sorry for this massive long story and I've tried to shorten it as much as I can. I am to go to the doctors in 2 weeks thats my next appointment. Am I in any danger for long term use and abuse that I didn't even realise was bad for me. Will I experience any trouble if I just stop them the nytol that is. The doctor I spoke to today was telling me to continue the propanolol as instructed do not stop them.   
Is there any medicine that just makes you feel emotions again? I am so numb I feel like I could just stare at a wall for the rest of my life I don't even feel like talking half the time. I've been on Zoloft for over three months and it's not helping, I just want to feel again I feel nothing  
Hello  I have been happily married for a long time. We've had our ups and downs, like any normal marriage, but there's always been a lot of love.  We've just come through a horrifically stressful 18 months, mainly due to financial worries. I have felt permanently stressed, worried, very vulnerable and often humiliated (unable to pay for school trips, turning down social invitations etc). My self esteem has taken a battering and some days have been so hard. But, I've soldiered on, kept my chin up and still took a lot of comfort in the fact that, despite everything, we still had each other and we still had a lot of love.  But, these last 6 weeks something has changed. I'm experiencing feelings of anxiety and panic. I can only feel negative about life. All my optimism has gone, and I feel like I have nothing left to fight with anymore.  But, the very worst thing is that I feel like I don't have any love left for my husband anymore. It's all gone. When I look at him, I just feel tense and anxious. Just him being around makes me feel worse, and I have to force myself to be affectionate, and I have to pretend to be my normal myself. I genuinely feel that if I won the Lottery tomorrow I would walk away from him, and never look back. There's been a few rare flashes of the old loving feelings these last few weeks, but that's all.  I feel calmer, more centered when I'm alone, or with our children. The moment my husband walks in from work I tense up, I feel more anxious and I try to avoid him in the house. When only 2-3 months ago, cuddling up on the sofa with him was the best part of my day.   I don't understand what is happening to me? Have I stopped loving him, because I'm depressed/suffering with anxiety? Or, am I suffering with depression/anxiety because I have stopped loving him?  There's no denying that deep down I probably hold him responsibile for our current financial difficulties. He's a very clever man, but he's made a few reckless decisions, and he admits that often he doesn't 'work smart' but busies himself with stuff that interests him, rather than work that would be more financially productive. Added to this, he's admitted he feels very down and withdrawn, and certainly he's not the optimistic, dynamic man I knew and loved only a few months ago. But, he's still affectionate and caring towards me.  I would really appreciate it if anyone could respond and reassure me that something similar has happened to them, and that's it's down to anxiety/depression. Otherwise I can't believe that 20 years of marriage has come to an end.  Thank you. 
Hi everyone   I have been on Sertraline 50mg since mid November for depression and anxiety. I was feeling good up until a few weeks ago when I started feeling down more regularly and the anxiety crept back up on me.  The only available appointment with any GP is two weeks today. I'm struggling at the moment and was wondering if it was worth me increasing my dose to 75mg or 100mg? Then explain to the GP when I see her and request a new prescription.   Has anyone done this before?  A x 
Hi, I am really struggling with depression and anxiety at the moment. I am feeling so alone, and don't have anyone to talk to. I have suffered with depression and anxiety all my life, and still have bad episodes even though I try and avoid my triggers, take my medication and try and exercise.  At the moment I can't concentrate on anything, can't sleep, can't eat and my head hurts! I just can't deal with feeling like this anymore! It's driving me mad. I just want to sleep forever. 
They say if you don't live for something, you'll die for nothing.   
I know I am depressed because I've taken every diagnoastic test possible. But I have zero excess to medical care or a shrink because I'm from a very conservative family who thinks psychological problems aren't real. I need alternative methods to cope with my severe depression. Any help would be highly appreciated thanks.  
I just wondered if anyone could list a few of the symptoms that they go through with depression because I know I have anxiety and stress and I have it quite bad but some people have been telling me that I might also have depression but I'm not sure because I don't know the signs of it. Could anyone help? 
I'm 19 and have been suffering from depression, anxiety and binge eating disorder for the past 7 months and I am currently taking fluoxitine 20mg. I started taking the pills about a month ago and whilst I am starting to see some benefits, i.e. some positive days, I am still quite up and down in my mood and when I feel bad, I feel really bad. My anxiety plays up, and then I become either extremely sad, numb or angry. What has made me feel worse recently is the fact that no one seems to really care. I mean, my family know that I am taking anti depressants but they don't truly seem to listen to me, instead I get the feeling that they think I am over exaggerating. For example, if I try to open up about my insecurities (which is one of the reasons I have become so depressed) they disregard it as a phase every teenager goes through, when in actually fact it has made me self loathe and hate who I am. My older sister who is also clinical depressed even said that my feelings are 'moderate' and that you can only truly know if you are depressed if you have kids. But the worst thing is, people have seen me on a positive day and so expect me to just 'snap out' of it when im feeling my worst. I don't expect anyone to understand, I would just like to know people care and will be there for me no matter what.  The thing that has got to me the most recently is that I believe that I give more than I receive, meaning I seem to care for people more than they care for me. For example, my closest friend found out her boyfriend cheated on her recently, and despite my own issues, I was there for her, day or night, comforting her and making sure she didn't feel alone- something I wouldnt wish upon anyone. I have experienced nights when I just cry because i feel so lonely and hate my own company, which is why I was more than willing to be on the phone to her all night even if she protested. I would send her little quotes to make herself feel better about herself because I know what its like to have your confidence knocked. But when Ive been down, she doesn't stay up with me or make nowhere near as much effort as I do. It pains me to say that because I am aware of how selfish it sounds- but I am not saying I wouldn't do any of that stuff again for her because I would and will continue to do so. I guess I would just like someone to be there for me in that way. I've given up on trying to open up to my other friends because they don't get how bad I feel or why i feel that bad. I feel like i need to pretend im happy all the time because i dont want to be seen as miserable. I just feel so lost and empty and I have had enough of trying to reach out to people. 
I have a ringing sound in my ears. Is it from depression or the antidepressants? Thanks. 
Hi, am on Cymbalta 60mg and Mirtaz 15 mg and Bralix 7.5mg.  This  is my 15th month of depression, is anyone taking these medicines as i feel i have not progessed much 
Every day when I wake up I make the decision that today is not the day I am going to kill myself,  but today I realised it will come as surely as the sun rises each day.  There is an inevitabiltity about it and while I will not today I recognise I will in the not too distant future.  I have lung disease too (not severe) but am busy smoking more than ever trying to hurry my natural end up and I hope it comes soon.   I am finding life too hard and it is getting more difficult to cope.  For example I have no hot water and haven't for around 9 months because my home is such a mess I can't find the physical or mental strength to deal with it,   I am completely on my own with it - family nor friends care to help and I have asked a couple of them.     I am on ad's and tried to seek NHS counselling,  but they turned me down for it as according to them I only have moderate depression.  I can't afford to pay so that's that.   I am fed up of trying to fight on my own and want my natural end to come as soon as possible.  Please God hurry it up. 
I get this pressure in my head. It feels like something is wrong in my brain and everything is really bad. It's a truelly horrible feeling. This goes on for about 40minutes then it goes down and i return to some 'normality'.   My question is: Is this Depression?  I've been on citalopram for nearly a month now. I've felt some benefits with reducing anxiety but this 40minute feeling is still happening.  I find my head full of thoughts that aren't good during it and seems very difficult to think of anything else until it passes. It's not that i don't have interest in things i just want to feel normal so i can do them.   I also notice there are very painful trigger points on my arms and neck just below the skull.   I'm aware of Fybromyalgia and wonder if this is related as i'm not staying in a depressed state.   I think my concern is the old cliched something on my brain like a tumour or something. The feeling can get really intense and like i have to quit everything (job, flat, gf ect) and move back to my old town. I don't really want to do that.   Any advice? I'm currently on a weekend away with my gf. My routine is obviously different but i would usually enjoy that. 
Lying here in bed thinking what would happen if I took over 200mg of sertraline straight off would it hit me between the eyes and make everything rosy for a while. Just for a little bit, I would go out up in the hills and become one with nature. That sounds good to me. Thanks x  
Excited. Open the gate here I come!!!! I cannot fully express how magnificent I feel at 4.46 am  
I would like to know if anybody is smoking whilst depressed and on antidepressants? Can you come out of depression whilst still smoking.   
Hey everyone, Ive been feeling really tired lately and was hoping for so advice on how to stay more energized. I sleep until 11am or 12 noon and stay awake until about 5pm and if I feel like fighting my fatigue I will sleep at about 8pm and it cycles like that. Also, I find that recently my mind wanders and I lose more focus during any social activity. I usually drone everyone out and dont contribute at all. So any advice there could help too. 
Hi,  I am a 41 year old male who has finally gone to the Dr this week for help with Depression and Anxiety.  GP has presribed 10mg of Citalopram which I have to increase to 20mg next week.  I am on day four of the drug and feeling like I am getting over some of the side effects like nausea and headache but I feel more depressed than I did when I started taking them!  Last night after taking a sleeping pil (3.75mg Zopiclone) at 9.30 I slept for about 3 hours then awake for the rest of the night.  In that time I did think about the horrible subject of suicide and other dark thoughts, but only in the sense of frustration that I am putting my family (wife and two C) through so much pain at the moment.    My question though is this....if I mention the above to my GP and mention that I have had general thoughts of suicide - is he likely to section me?  I've seen a friend who got sectioned to a hospital and it was shocking.  I couldn't handle that.  Thoughts please in desperation!   
I've noticed that about two days ago I have just randomly started to cry for no reason i don't know what to do to stop myself from crying I've tooken deep breaths and I've done everything but I just out of no where shoot out crying what is wrong with me? Do I have anxiety or depression? What should I do? Please help this is urgent..

I am depressed for over 14 months. Am on antidepressants with very little improvement. Sometimes I wonder if AD really work. I read an article which mentioned that ADs don't work and they are just placebos with side effects. I am trying to find some answers from people who have some knowledge on this statement. 
each day wake with nausea which dissipates as day goes by allowing me to eat by teatime. Dont sleep well either. 
Hi all. I've currently got ongoing depression and anxiety which is just getting worse. I am seeing a cbt therapist also. Not sure what will come out of this. My panic attacks are happening more and more. Dr has prescribed propanol of slow release 80mg. My need for alcohol is bad too. I'm fully aware of the dangers. Fed up and tired of it all now.

I have been depressed for the last 15 months and from the time my depression set in I am feeling Chills all the time and have lost 6 kg.  Thanks in advance. 
I just joined this site after finding it in a google search for "I'm such a nice guy, i cant ever find anyone to fully appreciate me for me, I cant keep a job, I have add and i'm overly distractable and love people who cant show it back"  this is going to be long  I'm 45, 9 months ago I ended a 28 year relationship that started when i was 18. He was 10 years older than me, he said he loved me, but i really dont think he did. ya know what Thats irrelevant now i'll just talk about what i'm feeling now.  I just got laid off again, I got laid off last march, got a temp to hire position and after the contract was to go to full time, they terminated it without cause and the agency said it was prob because they didnt want to hire anyone and have to pay more.... they had nothing but good reviews for me.  I'm a nice guy, thats what everyone tells me. I'm one of those people that when i start a new job, i'm easily approachable and likeable. I wont lie, I like people to like me, I'm a people person and i like to please people. I know it sounds odd but making others happy makes me happy and feel good. LIke with my ex. I did so much and changed so much of me, to keep th erelationship stable all those years, that I got to the point one day where it was enough. I couldnt change anymore, I couldnt not be me anymore but even through months of therapy he still blamed me for everything and said I needed to change more, I was too high energy, caused him anxiet, caused him stress, Didnt hold one career for the term of our relationship so didnt make him feel secure. It was always about security & money, I always got told "you're so creative you could have such a good job, make so much money, be in a better position.... all the time.   I didnt get any intamacy - sure on the rare occasion, we had sex, but it was never fufilling for me becuase it wasnt ever emotional for him. I know i'm passionate i know i'm excitable, I know that i can be very airheaded or free spirited, I get bored super easy, I hate being alone, not because I cant find anything to do but because I thrive around people.   I feel worthless, I'm 45 have no job, have to look for a job yet again, have NO saftey net, have had so many different types of jobs and sent out hundreds of resumes and have heard nothing but denials back. I'm not good at organizing mundane tasks like paying bills and putting the toilet seat up, It annoys people that I like to talk alot or that I like to i'll talk about anything that comes into my mind which changes every 10 minutes. I've gone to therapy and they say the same old thing, make list, try reminders, try meditating, I have and no matter what It just seems to not work at all.  I feel trapped, trapped in my mind, I have no way out, I have no idea how to fix it even though I can easily identify all the things that are wrong with me, but despite all that I have not figured out how to conquer it. I have my moments where I feel ok, but they pass quickly and then i go right back to being sad, so sad that I cant even explain it. I dont wan to kill myself, I just dont want to exist anymore, I dont know how to do anything I want, I cant seem to get a grasp on being alone, being an adult or being me, because me is not happy on my own. And I just dont know what to do. I really dont.  I always feel like i have to change myself to make people able to deal with me, because when i'm myself, they call me overemotional or weird or otherwise retarded. Its just very frustrating. I just feel like giving up. 
Right, where do I start?   I'm 26. Male.  Working but on a zero hour contract but usually work the whole week (45 hrs).  That's where the good ends and the real crap begins.   I have no qualifications after getting two C's at A-level. Studying is something I find almost impossible.   I am socially awkward. I'm always afraid of what I said sounded stupid. I actively avoid any form of social activities.   I have zero friends. Yep nobody to hang out with.  Sure I say a few words to work colleagues and I think they genuinely like me but who really knows.  I've never had anything remotely like a romantic relationship and pretty much given up hope of ever finding anyone. I mean who would want to be with me anyway?  I'm boring, stupid, and unsuccessful.  I've tried taking to some girls online but after a a few sentences I can tell I'm being nothing but a boring drag.   I'm a nice guy but that gets me nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. I think I've gotten to the point where if I had a button that would kill every human being on the planet I'd push it.  When it comes to physical work and actually producing visible results at work I'm unstoppable. That's the main reason I'm called in to work as much as I am.  Work is the only good thing going on in my life right now. Without that I don't know what I'd do.   Not a day goes by where I don't think of committing suicide. But I know I won't do it. Not at this moment in time anyway. My mind often ponders about what would be the best way to kill yourself.  Jump off a building, car wreck, dive off a cliff, hanging, slit wrists, overdose, gunshot to the head (overseas). That's as far as I've gotten.   The topic of death occupies a big part of my daydreaming. I find it fascinating. What happens when you die? Do you just switch off? Do you wake up elsewhere (life doesn't seem real to me, more like a dream). I hardly recognise myself in the mirror. It's more like looking at a stranger.    As if the other day I've started cutting at my arm. Self harm. I never thought I'd end up here.  I'm on anti depressants at the moment. I missed one dose and went very far down hill. Back up today but not fully there. Doubt I ever will be.   I don't even know why I've written all this. It's unlikely posting this here will have any effect for the better.   The best words to describe my current feelings:   Low/down, disconnected/detached, zero self worth, useless, worthless, failure, unwanted.  Of well. Nothing ventured nothing gained.   Regards,   X99 
I'm not really sure what else to do anymore, I've been very depressed lately and all anyone says is to get over it expecially my husband he says he supports me but days when I can barley get out of bed and I don't get the house cleaned I get yelled at, am I just being stupid? Alot has gone on in my life when I was young my mother was very abusive and I've just never seemed to be able to get over that. I've tried going to therapy but they just shoved so many pills down my throat I felt like a zombie and it's made me gain 50 lbs and that makes me feel worse about myself. I've thought alot about suicide lately but I don't ever think I would actually try it. I'm just trying to find someone that has been through this I'm not sure what else to do anymore. 
I have anxiety which has gotten worse over the past few months, getting facial tics from it which is driving me mad  but also Iv developed depression I think. The things I love doing and make me happy seem like a chore at the moment like I can't be bothered to do them but I force myself because I know deep down I love doing them and no matter how much sleep I get I feel exhausted. And all I think about is bed and sleep and have a feeling of kind of numbness, and don't feel excited about anything. I feel like a walking zombie! Has anyone ever had this and have overcome it?  
After years of having depression (probably my whole life) i decided to start my tablets for the second time. Within an hour or so of taking it, i began to feel very nauseous and my anxiety and paranoia got worse. Any info i recieve would be great. Thanks 
I have been very depressed and have been feeling so much pain anymore. So tired of the feeling of pain. Broken heart pain that I have been dealing with for very long time. Just can't stand it anymore. Don't even want to get out of bed or go to work anymore. Really don't want to be here anymore.  
Hi everyone, I'm looking to see if anyone has stopped Venlafaxine cold turkey from 150mg. I was on 450mg for 2 years and Pit on 30kgs. As much as the medication helped me mentally it crushed me physically.  I decided I wanted off. I cut back 1 table, so was down to 300mg for three weeks. I had bad flu like symptoms and wanted to sleep all week. It was bearable so I then cut back another tablet and was down to 150mg. Same thing, I could handle it so two weeks later I stopped cold turkey. I'm now on day 3 cold turkey and feel like I'm on my death bead. I have had the worst headache ever and feel like I'm on my death bed. I am tempted to take a tablet but couldn't bare to go through this again.  Any idea when I will start to feel better? I'm taking Advil, fish oil tablets 1500mg and am drinking lots of water.  
So it's gone 6:00am and ive had No sleep all night! Now I just wait half an hour till my babies get up!  Anyone know of strong/good over the counter sleeping tablets/medicine/anything?  Have tried a few but don't remember all the names?  Have tried kalms, night nurse and couple others. Doctor said he won't give me sleeping tablets, At least for the time being  xx 
I had a pretty bad childhood. My father was a drinker and a drug addict and he caused me many traumas. But experiencing the bad side of life as a kid made me wiser. When i was 12 i started to notice what was actually going on and i was depressed in a way. That so called depressen lasted for 3 years. Then i met a girl who saved me, heald my scars and i was the happiest person in the world. But a couple of months passed and she left and that broke me very much, i started changing. A couple of months passed and i went to Montengro for a vacation. My two friends and I were at a little island called "Hawaii" (trust me i dont know why its called that). We climbed up the highest point of the mountain where you could see the whole city of Budva. It started raining and i was just standing there looking at the city, looking at the blue sky, the grey clouds, the rainbow. In that moment i felt at peace, i felt that i had met my soul, in that moment everything in my life made sense and i got rid of all the bad things in my head. We went back home to Serbia and that peace in my heart continued. Two months passed and in august last year my father died. That broke me and took away that peace inside off me. I tought that i had accepted his death,that i made peace with it, but it turns out i just buried it inside of myself and i had put on a mask of so called "happiness". And last month I realized that i had changed completely. I have become so agressive and rebelious. Many close people have told me the same thing. I feel that i am full of anger and i just want to get rid of it, I want to me my old self again,that little boy who had i kind heart and a clear mind, i just want to find peace again. If anybody is going trough the same thing and could help me, i would appreciate it very much. :D 
My overall experience with reboxetine has been very positive.  I have been taking reboxetine 4mg twice a day for over 2 years for anxiety/depression. When I started, I almost immediately noticed the anti-anxiety effects. Unfortunately, I also had pain in what seemed to be my prostate. I had difficulty urinating and a stinging discharge. My mouth was very dry and I felt very warm.  I dropped down to about 1mg twice a day and the painful side-effects (probably due to my prostate swelling) very quickly subsided. I ramped back up to 4mg twice a day over about a month.  I now do not get the pain, but get a stinging sensation every so often. However, I have ways to control this. The dry mouth is easy to counter - I take water with me and drink lots of it. This also helps the stinging as it makes me urinate more frequently. I also have piles and bleed frequently. My heart rate is also higher than normal. The extra warmth is no problem for me as I always used to feel far colder than other people.  I have tried citalopram (about 40-60mg/day) for about a year and Venlafaxine (about 37.5-70mg/day) for far less. I seem to be very sensitive to SSRIs and my experience with Venlafaxine was pretty bad. I have also tried propanolol, but that had little effect. I have also taken diazepam for short periods of time.  Despite the side-effects that I experience, taking the SNRI reboxetine has been worth it. The anxiety-reducing effects are, for me, strong. It has allowed me to go out and lead a near-normal life.  I have recently become more concerned about the increased heart rate (110-115 at rest) and have started on a low dose of a beta blocker, 2.5mg bisoprolol/day. I guess this reduces the effects of the increased noradrenaline levels on muscles. I will see how this goes.

Reboxetine had a terrible effect on me.  I tried it for depression, after reading good comments about it (mainly from the drug company's own research) on the web.  I had high hopes, but was not only disappointed - it made me very ill!  I felt exhausted, sick, and breathless.  My heartrate seemed to be fast.  I gave it a few days trial in case the bad effects wore off, but they didn't.  I saw my GP, who checked my resting heartrate.  It was 137 beats per minute.  No wonder I felt dreadful!  Although the GP didn't think it was the drug at fault, I stopped taking it.  The effects (fast heartbeat) lasted for a fortnight and I spent a week at home too disabled to do much at all.  My unwell, 70-year old mother, was able to walk faster than I could.  I think people should be warned about this drug.  I have been told the effects I experienced are 'rare', but they are certainly very frightening and unpleasant, and, I suspect, dangerous. I insisted my GP send off a yellow report card.  I got the impression she wouldn't have bothered otherwise.  [i:cd5d4fd257]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:cd5d4fd257] 
My partner has just gone to bed feeling very depressed and I have just found a packet of Zopiclones he took: he took 3 x 7.5 = 22.5 mg.  I don't think it is a lot as he used to take a hell of a lot more, but I wonder if I should worry? How many zopiclones does one need to take in order to start worrying about having taken an overdose? Thanks for any advice.

Hi. I am 16 years old. Looking back I think I have been depressed most of my teenage and maybe before life. I have days where I just can't get up apart from to get food or water. I would describe it as laziness I just "can't be bothered" to move. I see no point. I am beginning to think i am just a lazy person. At school I am VERY quiet and find it differcult to talk to anyone. I have 2 close friends but I just can't talk about my feelings with anyone. In the last few weeks I've been diagnosed with dyslexia, gone to the doctor and been referred to a mental health service in my area and not told anyone. I know it sounds like I'm doing things to help but when you go to the doctor saying your sad all they do is give you a leaflet. I'm anxious. I am constantly anxious. We have a person who helps with the wellbeing of people in the school but I feel so embarres and guilty that I'm wasting her time and think that she must think I'm such an idiot. The biggest thing that worries me is that she thinks I'm faking my symptoms. I hate to think that. But things always work out that it looks like that. I had a meeting with her where she tells me to come to her room when it happens and the next day I'm in there. I'm dreading going back to school. I've just reached breaking point and no one knows.  Thank you  
I am sitting at my desk at work trying to stop the tears. Awful weekend, had to call Samaritans, my fear is that I don't want to exist anymore, what is the point in me or just anything. I am on 50mg sertraline and have been for a couple of years, seeing gp again tomorrow. I am so tired, everything is slow motion and it feels like I want to vomit my own body to get rid of it. So frightened 
First step Talk... 
I hate this illness with a passion and yes I curcome to its brutality, just wish for all my knowledge and understanding of it I could somehow master it, yet to no avail � Sorry for my moan just feeling frustrated  
Hello, I'm jade. I'm 22 years old. When I was 17 I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and PSTD. I was put on 300mg of fluoxetine which I took till I fell pregnant with my daughter in 2012... after I gave birth to my daughter in 2013 I went back on my tablets but they made me worse than ever. So my doctor then put me on sertraline. I am now on 300mg of sertraline. If I forget to get my tablets It's the worst feeling in the world. I get dizzy constantly, it feels like I'm gliding when I walk and I cry at everything. But when I take my tablets I don't feel full stop. It's almost as if I am numb. I have been on my tablets for over 6 years now and almost feel like I can't do without them. Will I be like this forever? I don't feel normal. Sometimes I feel like I should just be locked away in a padded room. Will I ever not rely on pills?  
I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.  I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will become a burden.  I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know.  I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.  So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.  I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.  I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.  A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss, finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?  I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.  Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired... 
Hi there, I've gained weight over the past 6 weeks after coming off of venlafaxine - I was on it on and off for 5 years.  I thought it was due to the supplements I started taking (5htp, l-tyrosine, vit b complex) but I've read a few reports of rapid weight gain after coming off meds.  Has anyone else heard of this?? Can the weight be lost? I'm exercising and eating super healthy and gaining weight by the day......, help!!  
started all of a sudden..... everything i did that interests me before doesnt seem to interest me anymore. iam not sleeping anymore, i dont feel beautiful anymore infact i spend all day worrying about how iam not sleeping and i end up awake all night anad then i wake looking and feeling terrible. i was genuinely hapy before, nothing seemed to bother me, i was beautiful as per the compliments and i was happy, had my masters so feeling quite accomplished. all of a sudden i finished my program had a lot of free time, my boyfriend moved to another state, i started having negative thoughts untill that is all i basically think about now. my work is not fulfilling and even at work i hear comments like u look tired etc etc that dont just boast my self esteem at all. my married boss is trying to have an affair with me and it feels like i should just give in since nobody wants me either way. this feelings are all new strange and depressing because this time around last year i was the complete opposite, joyful, full of life, enjoyed hanging out, seeing good movies, shopping, making beautiful hairdo and just looking beautiful. HELP ANYBODY PLEASE HELP. 
Hi, I am feeling chills all the time for the last 14 months since my depression. I am now on mirtaz and venlaflaxine. Lost 6 kgs in weight. Is there anyone who feels the same? I also dont have any feeling - feel flat.    
I've got tardive dysikinesia from taking antipsychotic medication (for just a week..!) and there isn't much anyone can do really. All treatment for it involves taking other strong mind altering drugs with equally evil side effects.  It sucks. I am living my life to the fullest I can regardless of my involuntary oral buccal lingual tongue and mouth movements and other odd tics but having no-one to talk to that truly understands makes me so frustrated and sad. I have online friends both in the UK and America with the same condition which are an immense source of support but none of my immediate friends or family come close to even beginning to understand what it is like. How could they? How could anyone? Psychiatric treatment does save lives but it also destroys it too.   Sorry for the mini rant - just having a bad day. Living with this for more than a year so far gets tiring. � 
Hi I dont want to die but i just want to admit in hospital for few dys but not in a critical situation in normal situation i want to become ill or sick for some day soo how many pills i should take  
I've had anxiety and panic issues for about 7 months now. I was getting better without meds but then i would get these spells in my head where this pressure will build up slowly my thoughts get weird and down. They then go REALLY down/hopeless/what's the point etc and detached. I wonder where it's going to go as its like an impending doom feeling aswell. I get a pressure feeling especially on the top of the bridge on my nose.   Then (usually after having some food) it's like someone releases the pressure gauge of it all and it starts to go down. I still feel odd after as it's quite traumatic. But i'm able to carry on and feel more like myself again.   i've been on citalopram 10mg for a week now. But this felt like it was coming on before i started taking them.  Is this depression? It only goes on for about an hour or so in total and it's scarily intense.   On a sidenote the sockets around my eyes seem darker with even a little bit of brighter red in the very corner. I've always had dark eyes but haven't noticed this before. 
I've been taking 150mg off sertraline my doctor recently increased my dose to 200mg I'm experiencing many side effects.. feeling lost in my own world want to be alone can't stick any noise and feeling numb like no feeling at all in my head has anyone experiencedo this plz  
I've been on Wellbutrin XL for about 5 months now and finally my mood is happier and I want to do more things that interest me. I don't mind getting out to see friends as much, which was a huge issue before. But over the past two weeks, I've wanted aboslutely nothing to do with my boyfriend of about 3 years. We live together, and he hasn't done anything wrong for me to feel like this.   But I can't stop thinking about wanting to be away from him or break up with him. We don't have much in common, but we've always worked well together. I've always been attracted to him, too. But now I look at him and can't even see that. I don't want to be intimate at all, not even sit with our arms touching on the couch. I want to be with my friends or talk to my friends online more than I want to be home with him.   I don't understand why I feel like this. It is something with my medicine or have I just simply fallen out of love? How do I even handle that?   As a side note, I've noticed recently that even though he tries, it's very apparent that he can't handle my anxiety or depression as much. He's always been as supportive as he can be, but when I try to get him to reaffirm our relationship and his confidence in it, he just says that he knows my depression and anxiety won't last forever (my doctor said it was likely caused by a car accident and may go away after time). I can't help but feel guilty that he has to deal with this and angry that he can't deal with this at the same time.  I don't want to have this conversation if it's just my depression talking - I can't afford to live alone and not have his support at the moment.  I'm completely lost.   
Has anybody come out of depression whilst smoking and taking antidepressant at the same time. I smoke 5 cigs a day and am on antidepressants for the last 14 months. 
Can someone inform me how long goes it take for venlaflaxine 225mg and mirtaz 15mg take to kick in and start working - californian rocket fuel. 
My mom doesnt seem to care that im sad... Ive been depressed and sad and i dont know how to get her attention i dont want to end my life i just want to get her attention and show her that im hurt and need help how do i do that? 
I would like to hear from from people who are taking effexor(venlaflaxine) and mirtaz. My doctor just started me on them. 
Hi everyone.  I'm posting this because I have been going crazy the past couple of days.  I am 20 and have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 4 years.  I can't tell you how wonderful he is.  He is kind, smart, funny, and comes from an amazing family that I love so much.  Our love has always been stable and strong; he is my rock and my very best friend in life.  We have the same goals and values, and I know that I want to have a family and future with him.  We don't have giant arguments - we are really good at communicating and working out any problems we might have had.  I've never once questioned us.  Until about a few days ago, when I literally woke up and felt nothing.  This is the scariest feeling in the world.  I went from absolutely ADORING him, to feeling nothing.  It has given me such bad anxiety the past few days to where I can't eat or sleep really.  I pace around my house obsessively, thinking about every little thing about us.  I feel pangs of guilt anytime that he does anything sweet because he loves me SO much and I feel like suddenly, I can't reciprocate that.  I've struggled with the question, "Am I still in love with him?" and it has broken my heart to even ask myself that.  I feel so guilty, like I am keeping a secret from him and he's living in this blissful ignorance.  I don't want to leave him, and I don't ever think about what it would be like to be with anyone else.  It makes me anxious to be around him because I'm constantly overanalyzing everything to see if I feel the same way, and to not be around him because I just keep overthinking.  Some background: Starting just after Christmas this year, I have really struggled with health anxiety stemming from problems that did not really exist.  I thought I had a brain tumor and spent every moment trying to convince myself I didn't.  I took two trips to the ER during that period, where they told me that I had a pinched nerve and on the other trip, an anxiety induced migraine.  Things have calmed down since I have been to a doctor and she told me I don't have a tumor.  Then recently, I had a sensitive tooth and I couldn't help but think it was infected and I HAD to go to the dentist that day - or else the infection would reach my blood and I would die.  I know this sounds nuts, but I'm just trying to give you a picture of my life.    I'm a college student, and lately I don't have the motivation to do my work.  I used to be outgoing and ambitious, but now I feel like doing the bare minimum to graduate.  I am so anxious that I won't actually get into law school and will embarrass myself because of that.  I kind of feel like I'm always waiting for the next thing to come along and that I'm just sort of... existing.  Do you think this could be me projecting my feelings on to my boyfriend?  How could it be that one day I literally just don't feel the same way?  I'm constanly battling between "you're projecting your anxiety on to him" and "you think you have anxiety/depression, but you actually just don't love him" and it is driving me CRAZY.  I don't want to feel this way anymore.  Help please! 
I just don't even know where to begin with this really.  I just feel ultra lost in life and confused but most of all just terrified and I have long ago lost all motivation and any sense of hope or enjoyment in life.  I feel I have lost all direction and my life feels completely out of my control.  I am just existing and going along with whatever happens to me like a rag doll.  I feel helpless in life like a child who is scared and has lost its mother - just so terrified.  I am deeply embarrassed by this.  I feel no sense of self worth, my confidence and self esteem is at its lowest ever .... life has passed me by and almost all of this time has been as a pathetic and hopeless cas.  I have always been exceptionally sensitive and I always feel that I was not meant to be on this earth because somebody as weak as me just cannot survive here without self destructing or being destroyed by life's reality.  I feel deeply ashamed of myself and my anxiety and depression.  Completely pathetic and useless as a human being even though deep inside I also feel such a sense of sadness for myself like part of me still wants to reach deep and give me a big hug and save myself but I keep failing at this.  I imagine I would excel in another type of land or in another world where I am just able to be in peace and the way I am and be left alone.  I have already been through the days of finding small bursts of habits to keep me going - like playing computer games, or chatting online etc .... I have also been through under eating, over eating, binge eating, losing weight, gaining weight, not dressing, not washing, lying in bed - crying at the tiniest issues - worrying about worst case scenarios in life, and also feeling so completely  lost as to what to do with myself. I get scared in life to the point of paranoia.  I imagine the absolute worst will happen - getting into trouble, ending up in prison, ending up in a vulnerable situation, homeless, etc, etc, etc .... I find it really hard to trust myself, let alone other people because I feel I have no skills to cope in life.  I feel tense around others and only peaceful when I am all alone in solitude .... but this is also very lonely and isolating place to be.   I feel a source of guilt in terms of any relationship with my family - because they have not been able to help me - they have not been able to aid in my dysfunctional mind and circumstances.  I have felt trapped, hysterical and like a I am verging on psychotic at times - shouting, throwing things, anger, tears.  All this has already been and gone.  I have visited psychologists in the past as well as psychiatrists - but they have never diagnosed me with anything else besides general depression and anxiety.  And as I am particularly well able to articulate my feelings and problems lucidly and with intelligence then they do not realise the extent of my problem and the absolute unbearable sense of fears, paranoias, misery I feel inside I think.  It's as though I have never fallen into any 'categor'y. I think this is because I have quite a variety of psychological difficulties that all merge into each other sometimes and of course feed off one another. Because I have managed to hang on (to all outward appearances) to some kind of sanity, they do not see the real picture of the chaos in my mind and body.  I have suffered 3 strange 'episodes' in the last 15 years where I have lost sensation in my body and face and it has never returned.  This remained something of a mystery to doctors and I was eventually diagnosed with some kind of neuropathy or anxiety related bodily symptoms.  Physical manifestation of anxiety even though some of them argued my symptoms were not typical or fitting.  These reduced sensations have never resolved or returned and I now live with reduced and diminished sensation including not being able to sense pleasure sensations like massages or orgasms, pain.  I feel adverse to sex and always have - somehow I (sometimes) find it a bit dirty and repulsive and feel violated and I cannot live with how I feel because I feel like a freak to feel that way without any reason that I can recall.  I have no history of abuse that I can recall - just an anxious mother with some depression and negativity in her own thinking.  Apart from this I have just been scared since always and have never had the strength or courage to pull myself out and I am now at my worst point ever and have given up on life and am just existing.  I have tried within my very limitied mental means to pull myself out by attempting life changes in the past but have been crippled by my own anxieties and fears and these attempts have ultimately ended in the same patterns of failure.  I lack any sense of ability or life resources, no sense of strength and I am aimless in life - feeling as helpless as if I were a newborn.  I do not see the meaning or point in anything and feel it so diffiult to think of anything that would make me want to see a glimmer of light and really try again.  Been there, done that before.  Already too tired.   I feel like I want a parent figure to come guide me step by step and pull me out from this hole.  But that is just ridiculous and the more I think of how I should be able to manage my life, the more ashamed I feel of my bleak and fearful reality.  I now find myself in a very stressful situation in life currently.  And I arrived here through my own desperation and hysteria to escape my last situation and lack of seeing any other way out - an out of the frying pan into the fire situation.  I have tried in the past medication, cbt, citalopram medication ..... I am so sad that I have come to this point but I do not know how to get better or where to begin ..... so much seems to have happened inside my mind that I am genuinely afraid that I have gone quite mad (but am still managing to pretend to be sane) ... I cannot cope with the vast amount of emotions and their intense strength that I feel in terms of everything seeming so dark, desperate, scary, chaotic and my mind just can't process it all.  Particularly it just all feels a lot of thoughts for a tiny tiny mind to have.  I just thought I would write about it.  I have been through a lot of weird phases, living on baby food for a while, labelling the calories on everything, Obsessive tendencies to tidy everything to the extreme just to have an element of control in my life .... I have a problem with OCD where everything in my home has to be perfect and tidy and straight otherwise I feel very anxious and restless and as though things are dirty or that I have lost all control completely.  If I lose the ability to control even my home or food then I feel I will have absolutely nothing since the rest of my life is so far gone.  But the pressure this extreme thinking gives me is unbearable to live with and makes me tired and cry when I don't match up to my own pressure and standards.  I take ages to get ready every day on the days when I feel able to try and go out because I feel I have to put on a pretence of appearing respectable and 'ok' .... the reality is sometimes I cry, shout, like a toddler who can't handle adult life and who can't dress herself or manage her well-being and life.  Afraid.  Lost.  Unmotivated.  My mind wants it all to go blank.  I want peace.  Feel a complete loser in life.  Just want to float away quietly on a cloud or sleep and not wake up sometimes and just drift off into a haze where the last thing I think about is something uplifting and peaceful and far from the reality of this overwhelming life.  I feel guilty to myself and to the world for being this way.  The only way my stupid dreamy mind sometimes justifies it is to pretend I am a fairy from another world who was made perfectly but has come to an imperfect world and cannot hack it because it's too far from my own world.  And I imagine this particular thought in a sane way, not an insane way ... I realise I am not really this person but this is the best way I am able to get any comfort in how I feel in this life. 
not sure if this is the correct place to post this but I am going out of my mind with worry and unhappiness... I started a new job in December, I thought it was what I wanted to do but it has made me incredibly unhappy and I dread going into work. It is having a negative impact on my personal life, I am constantly down, I can't sleep at night, I'm miserable and I believe possibly depressed. I want to leave and I am in contact with my previous employer to try and go back there. Would a doctor sign me of for being so unhappy with the impact it is having on my everyday life, it is impacting relationships etc I don't even want to socialise with anyone,  Also if I was to get singed of sick could I then hand in my notice? I called in sick today as I was awake all night with worry about going in. The thought of going back is making me very anxious. The job role is in a school, it is not particularly stressful but it is having such a negative impact on me. Feeling very low. 
Hiya everyone  Just wanted to know if people who are depressed go through low periods of mood then after 4 weeks feel ok. Then can be weeks later i feel low again.  Also I have a really akward problem.I am hoping to find out if I can see a psychiatrist by end of the week however i feel really good in myself now and can't talk or express my feelings when in a low mood.   I keep telling myself it won't come back then sometimes it will come back.I think I am fighting it now from coming back.  Does anyone have any advice and/or do others experience this?  Thank   Jon  
Hi,  I've had depression since I was 8 years old. I had a very traumatic experience that I only got over when I was in my twenties. I've been bullied since I can remember, even now to an extent. My depression became really bad when my art work from my A-Levels was thrown away and I gave up on my plan to go to art college (I realise now I should have just made a new portfolio and got over it but hinsight is a wonderful thing).  I went from crap temp job to crap temp job, with months off in between, barely able to get out of bed (I felt like acid was filling my brain the longer I stayed in bed so eventually i would get up).  Ive made two attempts on my life and abused alcohol and drugs, though Im happy to say Im coming up to my years anniversary of quittting both (AA is brilliant).  I read a self help book (Robin Sieger) which really helps but ony when I can bring myself to read it. My problem is that I see things that will help improve my life as possibilities to fail. I did a course in a trade but because of this anxiety it took me 3 years to complete (it was a one year course) and now i cant bring myself to practice it and feel ive forgotten most of what I learnt.   My job isnt that bad, but because I was heavily abusing drink and drugs at the weekend i messed up at work far too much and the relationship with my two colleagues suffered to the point that they bullied me.  Now i only work with one of them but we cant stand each other (probably more me of her than her of me). I want to get out so badly but can't bring myself to commit to the same job elsewhere because i have no confidence in my abilities and cant commit to any other career. I think this is all related to depression and anxiety, which Im working on by reading my book and making affirmations every day (when I remember to).  I had therapy but it was rubbish. It was left to me to just talk, if I didn't she wouldnt ask me anything wed just sit in silence. She came to the conclusion that I was projecting old feelings onto new situations but thats about it. She came to a conclusion but there was absolutely no solution. A year of stirring up awful feelings for very little pay off, though Im glad i did it. Id have hated to have gone the rest of my life not knowing.  When I think about possible careers, bettering myself or changing job etc I get an acid feeling in my spine and brain which makes me feel like I want to die. Ive been feeling suicidal.  I try to tell myself 'things could be a lot worse' which they could, I'm not completely ungrateful, theres people that have lost their limbs etc and I'm here whining that I feel bad when I think about moving my life forward but I can't help the way I feel.   I think combining a medication with reading my self help book will get me through, only problem being no SSRI's have worked so far. Prozac, Venlafaxine, Citalopram (the worst by a country mile) have all failed and made me feel awful. The only drug I believe will work is a DRI (Wellbutrin as it's known in the US). Ive heard they wont prescribe it over here for depression but it works so well for people in the US I dont understand why they wouldnt use it here.  Does anyone have a similar experience with meds to me? Have you found one that works?  I also have social anxiety which has made social events like clubbing or pubbing near impossible (every cell in my body tells me to go home the second I arrive - thats why I loved alcohol, it was perfect for this problem).  Look forward to hearing your replies,  Mike. 
Im new here. Hello. Is anyone on sertraline for depression and negative thoughts. If so has it worked for you?? Thanks 
Hi there  I am returning to work tomorrow after some time off due to my depression - does anyone have any hints or tips to help me get through? Thank you.  JJJ 
Hi, does anybody have any personal experience of ECT? 
won't go into detail but was involved with CID last night,after some nice kind lady phoned them due to her concern as I was in a compromising positiion spoke to a really nice policeman who I had met before following my suiciide attempt back in Jan 2015 he said if I needed to talk to contact him.to ring the police. i am really struggling as I am ready to talk about stuff not that they can do anything as I don't kniow names etc and it happened a long time ago so is there any point? and it is not as bad as what other people have been throuhg and I trhink it is all my fault or is it wasting their time? Sitting here drinking, have supificial cuts and getting in a state as I feel so stupid, useless waste of time and space or am i just being dramatic??????????????????????????? This has been bothering me since last year following a BPD assessment where I was not totally honest and open as I  didn;t or don;t know who to trust. I just wish I had opened up to this guy last night as he did genually seem to care or is that just his job????? I just don;t know what to do.   
I have been depressed for the last 15 months without any success. This is my 3rd episode. I am 68 years male. I am on antidepressants - cymbalta, mirtaz and librex. No improvement. Major Depression. Has anyone come out of their episodes of depression and help me to overcome it. Thanks. 
I've been on sertraline since about August. Was working great. Felt lot better. But I started accidently missing a few doses. Then gradually kinda just took it once a week then yeah. Haven't for 3 weeks. Ive now had some major withdrawals symptoms. Depression slowly coming back. But I'm scared to take it. Had depression for 7 years. Is it going to take weeks again to start working. Do I have to start a with 25mg then go up. I'm on 150mg so it's been a big difference. I just hate the feel of what it does to me. Now I'm not on it I hate it because it's not me. Do I need to go back to my doctor or is it ok to stay off.  
Been doing so well. Dealing with other ppl's stuff starting mass of anxiety! Wish i lived in a trailer in the middle of nowhere! :0( 
Hi there - I have been using anti depressants since I was around 17 years old, I am now 34. I have been on Sertraline 200mg daily for approx 10 years, having tried to come off them several times over the years to no avail.  My question is - as there is conflicting info online - can these drugs stop working after a certain period? Also does anyone know anything (definite) about long term health problems of using them?  I have been advised several different things by doctors at my surgery - stay on them for good/taper off them over a year/taper off them over a few months (which has been hell in the past) - currently, I am experiencing more and more depressive episodes but I am taking tablets daily...just confused about what to do - should I change tablets for example?  Any insight much appreciated - I am currently off work for the first time ever due to depression, so things are...severe.  Jules 
I've been depressed for over one year one and I'm on 150mg venlafexine for one year now. But recently I have being having trouble waking up in the morning. No matter how much I sleep, I will not be able to get out of bed and stay awake. I literally fall asleep. I have so much work to do as I have my university entrance exams in few months. Even last year I couldn't get through as I was depressed and I am repeating this is year.  It's not that I don't have motivation to get up, it's just that I feel really tired and I feel like I don't have energy to even get out of bed  
I have suffered from depression and anxiety for many of years, but since the recent death of a friend I have been feeling something so more severe! It's like I'm My even sure it's depression/anxiety!   I am constantly down and suicidal, constant thoughts of death, I even get times of the day where I am panicking (like a panic attack) but I'm looking round and nothing seems real like I look at the people In the street and think crazy things like there not real etc! I generally feel suicidal all the time, I can't go outside, it's severe at work, I can't sit indoors because it's severe indoors!! I and have a lot of thoughts of death, my thoughts are so random and intense that it is over powering, I can't do anything? I usually could do a few things I enjoy over m over then gradgelly the depression would go. This is like nothing I've experienced before, would you say this is anxiety depression together? Do you think smoking can trigger waves of depression? I would just like to know I'm not the only one going through this, and how long it may last because I can't cope with life like this much longer.  Is there such things as depression panic attacks? Because the worse times are really bad I just feel like grabbing my head and screaming because nothing makes sense and I'm in panic over just basic life as we know it, life and people and buildings and stuff (anything) nothing makes sense   How can I just feel better, someone help me please. I'm going to stop smoking as I feel this triggers some of what's happening in my head, I've never posted on a page like this, I'm a strong person, but this is to much for me and killing myself seems like the only way to escape this's because it generally is to much!!! I'm Just in seek of some closure and advice how to get better.....  I'm a scaffolder, so I'm active in the day, exercising, I need to eat abit better if I'm honest to. There's just so much to write and I don't know how to explain what's going on in my head!! My thoughts are so powerful I can feel them in my head!! Ahhhhhhh! Just some advice or help please.   I'm going to start the magnesium treatment also? As a friend said it actually cured his anxiety and anxiety is something that has held me back for years! Can it also cure this depression? (If it is depression) I have so much more to say I just can't word it! I'm sorry if this is all over the place, I'm all over the place. James   
Is it true that the 3rd episode of depression takes longer to heal. That is what my doctor told me. My 1st lasted 9mts - the second 12mts. This one is going on now 14mts.  I would like to hear from people who have come out the 3rd time. Thanks.

After 22 years of living with my granddaughter on Sunday she is moving away and going 22 miles away. I am devastated cannot eat only drink tea cannot sit down for more than a few minutes. I feel there is a knife turning in my chest. I will see her again hopefully several times a year but in the meantime I feel so desperate. I am 72 years old married but my husband is a cold uncaring man with no emotions.  
Hello everyone, My name is Austin and my 20th birthday was last month. For those of you that most likely havent read my previous posts, I will give you a quick summary of who I am and my situation. I have felt depressed for the last 2 and a half years or so. I have never seen a doctor about this and the last thing I want to do is self diagnose myself. I cannot confirm if have the mental illness of depression. For most of those 2 and half years I have blamed myself for these feelings and shrugging them off as being lazy or just excuses. I'm an inntrovert amd I hate socializing with people in general (give or take 2 friends) which is normal. But the past years I have felt sad and down to the point where parties or family gatherings are just too draining. This blaming turned into self hatred and I found myself wanting to gain validation from other people in order to somehow cancel out this toxic self image. Of course, this never took me anywhere good on the account of me being very flawed (like us all) and I have had good bit of relationships where people walk all over me because I'm stupid enough to believe that being nice and trusting gets me somehwere. The latest example of this was a friendship with a girl that I had feeling for. She new and we talked and I felt as if she was the only one that actually cared and ignored my flaws. She started to treat me differently though and it hurt to a very high degree. I reevaluated myslef and asked what I was doing that made her act this way. She finally expressed her contempt and what I did to upset her. This had apparently been happening for awhile and she bottled it up to tell me now (mind you, she gave me the advice to never bottle up feelings which led me to open up about my feelings to her) and so I had alot to think about in such a short time. I took to blaming myself and overapologizing for very little things that I was afraid were annoying her and then my apologizing got annoying. I frustrated her constantly and I got to a point where I stopped doing anythng because I was tired of angering her. This eventually led to me and her "fighting" for a few months and her ending the friendship. Now, this was also a work relationship (because of course it is) and this situation cost me a promotion that devestated me (she was a manager at this place and an influence on my promotion) and I felt so crappy about her and I's relationship that I lost all motivation for the promotion altogether. This led to alot of work messups and, again, her being mad at me. It didnt help with my self hatred to have someone I admired constantly getting angry at screwing things up. Anyways, after a few months I had reached the end of my rope and quit my job because of how she ended up treating me at work. She felt hurt and made me the bad guy of course. I spent alot of time after that blaming myself and for the way I am. Drama isnt something I enjoy but this all spiraled out of control and I felt powerless to stop it. I hate myself for the mistakes I made and I fully take responsability for what I did wrong. But the wa she handled it and the way I was mistreated made me realize how much she actually thought of me. I'll never understand why she treated me this way, I fear. I have been told by a mutual friend that the way she treated me was wrong and that I needed to get away but I wanted to believe that we could still be the happy friends we were. I was wrong. After awhile my parents have found that I needed some therapy since I refuse to discuss anything with them and so I have called a few in my area and so far i have gotten voice messages and not a single call back. I'll keep trying but it is very hard to speak to someone on the phone and I find that I need to be very motivated to do so. I am very worried about this and I dont like the idea of talking to a stranger, as helpful as they might be. I'm mostly worried that my predisposed blaming of being lazy is true. I'm not sayong I want depression but atleast I would have a cause to my problem and I just want a resolution. I dont know if it makes me a horrible person to think like that, it probably does, but I'm worried Im not going to get out of this funk. I've "toughed" through it before and it hasnt worked so I hope some answers can be found,  Anyways, so thats how I am right now and lately I have been feeling unusually tired. I want to crash in bed at around 5pm and if im lucky enough i go to bed at around 8pm. I sometimes wake up at 3 pm and fall asleep again to wake up at my usual time of 11am. This cycle has been like this for the last week. I dont do taxing things either. I do laudry and dishes, etc. and hang out with a friend on rare occasion where I really feel like im going to fall asleep at the wheel. Today I have lost all interest in playing video games and I jsut sat in the dark for 4 hours until I started watching YouTube videos (which got boring fast). I sat with my dog and did laundry but today has gone so slow and I wasnt sleepy enough to go to bed yet.  I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to fix this sleepy feeling. I would love to hear any advice. 
Depression for 14 months. I do my exercise everyday but it is not helping my depression. Does exercise really help depression?    
I meant to say 240 miles away 
I broke up with my ex in August of last year. Now I have a new boyfriend and ever since my ex found out he is texting me saying he wants to suicide. He said quite a few different methods and it's really scarting me. I had been wanting to break up with him for over a year and couldn't bc of this behaviour. When I finally broke up with him he was ok for a few months until I met someone else. Now he is "forcing" me to say stuff like "I love you" by saying if I don't give him some type of hope  that I will take him back he will kill himself. I already called 911 on him once for this suicidal threats but they didn't do anything about it. Pls help  what should I do? 
Hi I've been on fluoxetine for six weeks. I switched over from celexa. However two weeks ago I was reduced to 40mg from 60 of fluoxetine as 60 had me wired way up.  I was doing better but this morning woke to anxiety and just out of it. My pharmacist said it would take time for the 20 mg to move out of my system. However was wondering will I adjust to the 40. And I know it's different for everyone but does it gradually get better in the adjustment process? 
Recently my boyfriend close family member got into hospital and they are dying because they have cancer. My boyfriend went to help them and in the beginning of his stay there we were speaking everyday he was saying he loves me and all of the romantic stuff. Few weeks ago he stopped writing to me. I didn't stop writing to him, saying him i love him, that im with him, and i only hope good. Than he started answering me with one word only. Than i lost my temper and i started taking my heart out in messages. Than he started being even more cold. And i feel like he wants to end the relationship with me. The problem is that only the tought of me not being with him is making me want to die. I miss him every day. I feel like im alone and i will never be happy again . This man is my one and only. In our relationship we went through a lot and we used to love each other a lot.  I really want  to help him.  And i want him to return his love to me.  
I'm in my mid-twenties and am female. I have suffered with anxiety and depression since I was a teenager, tried CBT and Fluoextine and Citalopram. Came off Citalopram at the beginning of the year, and have been anti-d free since.  Everything has been going great, I started a new job, have been exercising lots and eating healthily, and my mental attitude has been much better and I have been feeling positive about myself and life.  At my last job, where I'd been for many years, there was often a weird musty smell around a space about 12 foot square, and my colleagues always joked it was an elderly coworker. People sitting immediately around me were forever sneezing, sniffing and complaining of a bad smell. No one ever told me it was me or hinted or anything, and I am a clean person so thought it couldn't be me. An outspoken girl said it smelt "unpleasant" and like "sweaty salmon" on a few occasions. One time she sprayed deodorant into the air. She sat about 8 foot from me.  I started my new job and over the past few weeks I have noticed a weird smell near where I sit but only when I walk away and come back a few minutes later. To me it smells like an onion-y smell. People walking past my desk constantly sniff literally as they walk past my desk.  Yesterday a colleague said it smelt like gone off food, and today she looked at me, called another colleague over and whispered but I heard the words "smells"and "pi55" and she asked the other girl if she could smell it too and she agreed.  About a week ago, the other girl was talking about someone using the communal toilets and leaving urine all over the seat and she said how "that person must be getting lots of it on themselves too". Again, I didn't twig as I never leave urine on the seat and always make sure I clean myself thoroughly.  I use public transport to commute in to work and people on the train around me constantly sniff. Last week an elderly man sat behind me and sniffed literally every five seconds for the whole journey. I thought it must be because I smell and I was getting so paranoid and hurt, I wanted to turn around and punch him (I would never do anything like that).  Last week my manager asked me how I found the "hygiene" in the office which I thought was strange and then elaborated that he meant my commute. That made no sense but at the time it didn't click.  I shower every morning, wash my hair daily and use antipersperant and deodorant. I apply Perspirex nightly and use body spray and perfume. I clean sweaty areas regularly and carry change of underwear and wipes etc with me, I am so paranoid about my personal hygiene. I also started taking Chlorophyll supplements and reducing caffeine.  I do have greasy sebhorreic dermatitis but I'm treating it.  I think I do tend to be quite a sweaty person and my crotch does get sweaty but only usually when I work out, in which case everywhere else gets sweaty too.  Am I being paranoid?! No one has outright said that I smell, ever. This is making me so depressed, I feel humiliated, but I am a clean person. I feel suicidal. Please help me, I am really at the end of my tether, I am so unhappy. I don't feel like my family want to help, and I don't really have any close friends to talk to. This post is 100% serious. 
I can't take it anymore, it's time for me to ask my question and find out what's really causing me to be a really really worthless human being.  About me: I am 17 years old, was originally born in the Philippines. I moved to Canada in the late 2008, I was 12 years old by then. I went to my very first school, where kids talked English, and I didn't even know how to speak English. Thank god, there were two kids there that spoke my language! However, as the time passed by, I felt bullied by these 3 kids who were trying to put me in trouble. Such as, turning on the radio, and then leaves it open while I'm in the room alone (Yeah, I didn't really get to hang out with anyone, especially the kids that spoke my language). My classmates began to avoid me because my teachers spent most of their time teaching me english words. I felt really stupid by then, it felt as if I needed to kill myself and let them have everything. However, I wasn't weak, I avoided them just by doing my hobby, which was drawing.  I only stayed in that school for 1 year, because I was in grade 7 by then. I went to high-school feeling depressed, thinking about how many more students I had to counter with.  There were more people that spoke my language, but I didn't want to hang out with them, because first... I'm shy and bi, and my brother were friends with most of them, and I didn't really want to interact with them. I was a loner since then. My daily life were the same, day after day. Goes to school, try to learn but can't learn anything because of thinking way too much things such as "Where am I gonna go at lunch?". This habit kept going for about 4 years. However, between those years, my english improved a lot. When I was finally in grade 11, I finally got into a regular english class! but that didn't really changed anything in my life. I still went out at lunch pretending I went home for lunch. Depression and Anxiety began to increase. Grades were too low and didn't even make friends since grade 8. Until now that I'm in my seniors, I still don't consider anyone as my friends. I do hang out with a couple of people, but it feels like they don't consider me as their friend. On the other hand, I've been having learning disability lately. Since my grammar improved a lot in the passed few years, I began to overlook at them. The more I overlooked at my mistake, the more mistakes I've been making. The more mistakes I've been making, the more I asked myself questions repeatedly. As for my speaking, I used to be really good at talking in class (being the class' clown), but... I don't know, my pronounciation suddenly gotten worst. I am really bad at explaining things now, unlike before.   Life has been so hard for me, that I couldn't even find out what I want to be when I grow up. I really want to be a graphic designer and a veterinarian, but how am I suppose to achieve this goal when I'm really bad at socializing?  Problems I think I have: Social Anxiety Mental illness (When I think someone likes me, I throw rolled papers at the trash, until 1 paper goes in, proving he/she likes me) (Reading things over again, making sure I read and understood what it said) Lisp (I couldn't pronounce R, and I think my accent is getting in the way) Alzheimer disease (I've been forgetful lately, it's hard to remember a thing I saw/read) Always think the negative things that people think of me Mixing things up (Things I say is no longer making sense, unless I try my best to fix it before saying it) Skipping words (I always skip words when typing/writing) Overlooking at things such as grammar/comments/pictures/questions/answers Ashamed of my voice (I was born with an asthma, basically been coughing for 12 years, and I believe my vocal chords got affected. Now I sound like a frog/oompaloompa) Believing myself or not Become hyper (when I feel really positive, and think like I'm better (which I'm not)  Things I'm really good at: Being creative Publishing my works (painting, ideas, short stories and poems) Self taught Thinking about other people (Thinking ahead about how they'd feel when I ask them/ tell them things)  Sorry if this is so long, but this is how my life has been without seeking out for help. There are things I missed, but this is it for now. Hopefully someone got a solution.  
So finally got to see my gp, staying on the meds for longer.  i am taking citalopram 20mg daily. i am also on cocodamol for a chronic back pain which has been diagnosed as l4/l5 atrophy and disc dehydration possible cause is unkown but is wear and tear normal for my age! ha yea 31 and i have that! gp disagrees.  i also have a tilted pelvis with a shortened left leg, not much they can do for this either.  all of which is impacting my already low mood, so fed up now i just want to be normal! i have to go back if my pain gets worse! that is a joke i was in agony monday as my back spasmed again while at work!  I am unable to do much housework for the pain, unable to bend over or carry anything heavy.  Any one got any advise to help?  I see my osteopath again on monday so i am hoping that she has an idea or two. meanwhile i am using hot water bottles, painkillers and resting. 
In 2005 I was given 22 lots of electroconvulsive therapy. It left me with brain damage that means I will never work again. I was lucky because I got support from a neuropsychologist who allowed me to understand and come to terms with my problems. ECT can be used to great effect. However some people like myself end up severely and permanently affected. I want to use this place to link up with those like myself. So that we can support each other.  I don't say ect shouldn't be used. But people thinking of it should understand what can happen. The Information given about ECT side effects doesn't go into details, they talk about memory problems. Actually it affects far more than that. It causes cognitive impairment. 10 years on I need 12 hours of home help a week to help me care for my 3 kids. I tire very easily and some days I am able and feel intelligent. Other days if I have pushed myself and not been able to have a midday nap I struggle to do the most basic of tasks. Some days I'm not well enough to drive at all. Other days I will drive short distances. I was a doctor and well never work again.  Please let me know if you have had similar problems. Or if your thinking about ECT please make sure that you understand what could happen to you. It could mean permanent I'll health on top of your existing problems.I am no longer depressed. It wasn't stopped by the ECT but by psychological input to support me out of my coercively abusive marriage.  
since the beginning of my depressive episode i have been having stomach problems, nause! Loss of appetite till later in day and feeling generally unwell.  GP puts it down to the whole central nervous system upset but i feel somill some days i can hardly get up.  Every anti dep seems ro make it worse somi cannot manage to stay on them. Psychiatrist is attsmpting to try lithium for the depression but does it also make you feel sick?  Is there an anti dep out there without that side effect? 
So this my 3rd week on my own. Feeling nausea first thing in the morning. I'm not crying anymore and actually went out for the fist time just to the shop but it felt so good and energising.  I'm not missing my partner anymore. Maybe I was just use to him. Maybe I stopped loving  him ages ago all I know now I must get on with. I can't wait until  I buy a car and adventure out more. I'm actually looking forward to going back to work.now I know I can out. I don't even mind that it's Valentine's day. I know i will have bad days but today I want to give you all a little hope that there's light at the end of the tunnel. And having positive thoughts help. 
Hi all,   I've been having loads of physical problems the past month that are constant, 24/7 and have stopped me being able to do nearly everything. And for some reason (I won't argue as blood tests came back fine) my doctor has prescribed me the above anti depressants thinking they will 'break the viscous cycle' and make me better after a short cycle of them and then I should be good and fine again.  This is all great and hopefully it will work but part of my problems I'm having is no sex drive and issues down below and now reading about the anti depressant I've been given and it is saying you will suffer sexual desire and erectile dysfunction issues, this sucks but I only need a short course hopefully so I would usually be happy to sacrifice to cure my other symptoms finally.  But I've seen many comments saying these sexual issues can be permenant and or indefinite???  Surely that can't be right and if so I shouldn't have been prescribed this medicine, not sure whether to take it now as I don't want to take this risk, any help would be appreciated!!  Thanks    
Hi.. iv sufferd with depression for around 15 yrs on and off, I was put on to tramerdol 300 mg which seemed to help very well, and as I tuk them at nite helped with my sleep as well, but the middle of last year (2016) they seemed to stop working and when I tuk them at nite it made me really agitated to the stage I could not fall asleep till early hours of the morning, and only managing one hours sleep anite, this really started to get me down, and my depression slowly came back, there is no reason to why I felt this way, nothing really changed in my life, I live a lone which I love, and have done for 12 yrs, I'm not looking to get in a relationship at all, love my life as it is, except this feeling of very low mood, I went to the docs in tears not being able to stand any more, he put me on to mirtazapine 15 mg, then to go up to 30 mg , which I did, my depression seem to be ok, in a way, but 30 mg seem to affect my sleep again so I came bk down to 15mg and my sleep is fine, but my mood is once low again, i don't want to go bk to my doc as scared he will take me of mirt and my sleep will be out the window again so I keep putting this off, I do take kalms as well which help a little bit, please, please don't tell me to get a grip of life, and get out more, as iv seen on this forum some people seem to think this and all will be well, when your depressed, all you want to do is go to bed and sleep as that is the only time my mind is free of the depression, I would love to go to bed for a year and wake up, and life would be great, but that's not the reality of life, I go out every day walking my dog, so I'm not stuck in, and meet with friends, so yes I do go out, and yes iv talked to special people about being depressed, but that don't work I just feel worse then, I know that one tablet may work for one person, but not for another, but any ideas would help if I went bk to the docs and asked for me to stay on mirt for the sleep, but is there any thing eles I could take to help lift my mood, any ideas???  
Yesterday I went to see my doctor. He told me I have Melancholic depression. I was subscribed Cymbalta 60mg and mirtaz 30 about 15 months ago with very little progress. Can someone please help. Thanks. 
Hi  I started on 10mg citalopram 10 days ago and have felt really rotten since.   I suffer with migraines  And have had a migraine every day for the last 6 weeks.   Following discussion with my neurologist we both felt that I was getting a little low, eg not looking forward to things, tiredness, not sleeping and getting very anxious at times.    However since starting the citalopram I feel really down, no energy to do anything, no motivation, nausea and dizziness.... And also waking at 2-3am & unable to get back to sleep, constant headache  Is this Normal and will it settle, if so how much longer do I have to stick it out for?   Thanks in advance for any help   Fern

Hello i was on mirtazapine for a year but had to come off after terrible effects it caused i have been off 4 weeks now. I have been left with chronic functional abdominal pain which started in july and has caused me to be off work since oct. My gastro doc and psych dr suggested a low dose of lofepramine as trycilc ad would help depression and chronic pain. I am only starting at 70mg a night due to super sensitivity ti most meds even pain killers. I had first dose in sat and first 2 nights were fine but last night i felt so anxious thriugh the night severe dry mouth and sweating buckets i just feel plain weird. As of yet it is doing nothing for pain. Was wondering if anyone has any input on whether if i stick with it these effects will wear off? I am due back to work in 10 days and worried sick i wont manage if im like this. Many thanks any input welcome  
I have no idea where to start. I guess the beginning is as good a place as any. I apologise now for the length of this, it's a long story.   I'm a 27 year old female Veterinary Nurse that would really like to press the proverbial reset button.   Posting this feels like throwing a coin into a wishing well.   In December 2012 my 75 year old father was found in a coma in his flat by my mother after I had tried to call him on numerous occasions and he hadn't answered. He was in hospital for 3 months. He died on March 21st 2013. I was 25. My heart broke so hard and so loud I literally heard it crack inside my chest. It was my fault. It was my fault he had ended up in the coma. I hadn't seen him in almost a year. He would always cancel our plans to meet. What I didn't realise is that he had become a total recluse, an agoraphobic and a hoarder. I was the only person in the world that he spoke to and I didn't know what was happenning. The doctors said he had given up the will to live. After a course of Mirtazipine and much medical intervention it was looking like he was going to make a miraculous recovery...until he passed. I will live with that guilt for the rest of my life. At 25 I had lost the only man that would ever love me unconditionally.   Six months later, in October of the same year, I met a then 18 year old 'man' that changed my life. He was a colleague at work. He was handsome, sweet, intriguing and very persistent. I left my boyfriend of 8 years for him. He was the first good thing to happen to me after my dad died. And now I wish I had never met him.   I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.   The first 3 months of the relationship felt like I was using up all my 'happy'. I watched an episode of Grey's Anatomy recently where a couple of the characters were talking about being worried about using all of their 'happy' up. I panicked. What if that was me? What if I had used it all up in those first 3 months because I hadn't paced myself. I thought 'this is it.' I had found the one.   He said all the right things. Always complimenting me, telling me he had never felt this way before, the sex was incredible. I had never been so physically attracted to anyone before and for the first time in my life I felt uninhibited about my body.   The 7 year age gap was meaningless in the beginning. He was a colleague. My equal. But I had never been with anyone younger than me. And I obviously didn't know what was coming. What I should have expected.    We kept our relationship a secret from our colleagues with the exception of a few of our mutual friends. It was ridiculously exciting. Spending the night at his house, him driving us to work but planning to arrive at seperate times so we didn't get caught, him waiting in the car for me around the corner after work. It was the kind of romance you see in films or read about in novels. But if the cameras kept rolling or the authors kept writing, eventually the ending would look like mine.   A couple of months passed and we got less and less careful. I was so proud to call him mine I think I got slack about hiding it to be honest. I wanted everyone to know we were together. The secret romance was fun but I didn't want the other nurses to think he was available. So word got out that we were together. I was worried that the lack of secrecy of the relationship would take the sexiness out of it for him. But he seemed equally as happy for at least a month after that.   I can't pinpoint the day things changed. There were good days and bad days once 2013 turned into 2014. I wish I had kept I diary. I wish I had written down what had happened and how I was feeling every day. Maybe I would have noticed a pattern. Who knows now.   I read something the other day that said relationships end because people stop putting in the same amount of effort to keep you as they did in the beginning to win you. In his case, that is 100% true. Unfortunately for me, the more he pushes me away the harder I fight to claw my way back.   You fight like hell to hold on then you fight like hell to let go.   Things were really rocky for the six months between January and June last year. He would go days without speaking to me, he wouldn't care if he saw me, he stopped telling me he loved me, he stopped wanting to have sex with me. But I never stopped trying. I would always contact him first, always make an effort to see him even though I knew he didn't care whether I was there or not, I would still try and initiate sex even though I was always knocked back. You'd think after weeks of being rejected I would give up. False hope will be the death of me I swear.   Eventually on Tuesday June 10th 2014 I asked him whether I was what he wanted anymore and he said he didn't know and that he needed time and space to think. It had taken six months of him pushing me away for me to finally call him out on it.   Thankfully he had left the hospital I was working at, otherwise I would have had to face him everyday. I can honestly say I don't think I would still be here today writing this had that been the case. Fate intervened.   The next four months were the hardest of my life. I didn't have my dad and I didn't have the love of my life. I lived in a flat in London on my own. Every night I would come home from work and cry myself to sleep. I stopped eating. I thought the loneliness was going to kill me. I thought my heart was hurting so much it was sure to fail. I wanted it to stop. I just wanted my heart to stop beating. Being a Veterinary Nurse I had access to drugs that could make that happen painlessly and peacefully. And I thought about it. Every day I thought about it. But then I would think about my beautiful mum who had only lost her sister a few years previously and I remembered how hard she had taken that. And I thought about my sister who had lost her dad only the year before. And so I didn't. I didn't because of them. And only because of them. So I kept going to work, I kept saving animals' lives all the time wishing I could just take my own. And I kept coming home every night and crying myself to sleep. My dreams were the only time I got to see him and I never wanted to wake up. Him and my dad.   It did not let up. The sadness. The emptiness. The loneliness. I called it my little black cloud. It would follow me wherever I went. It was the height of summer last year when I went through this, beautiful hot sunshine most days and yet wherever I went was this dark cloud that would just rain and rain and rain on me. I felt like my legs weighed twice as much as they did before. They say when you're in love it's like you're walking on air. You're weightless. With a broken heart it takes all the energy you have just to take one step. I was exhausted. I had a headache everyday from dehydration from crying so much. I cried so hard my forehead felt bruised. I was an absolute mess inside. I was carrying around this burden, this weight of sorrow and it was so heavy. I think anyone that has felt sadness like that knows what I'm talking about. It was so fragile though, my act of being ok. A song, a smell, anything could remind me of him. I remember one day a male vet was wearing his deodorant, it was like being hit by a freight train. I was stuck in a small theatre with him breathing it in solidly for 2 hours. I still don't know how I managed to hold it together. I politely asked him not to wear that fragrance again.  On the outside I was just a girl trying to pass her final year vet nursing exams. Thinking about the future. I would wake up and put on my make up and go to work and pretended to everyone I was ok. Not one person on this earth knows what I was feeling in those months. And nobody ever will.   After four months of being apart, he came over to the hospital with a patient to perform an MRI. My heart stopped. I have an arrhythmia so I think it actually may have literally stopped. It took me 20 minutes to get my shaking under control before I could say hello. It was the first time I had seen him since he had left me. We talked and it was like nothing had changed. After he left I was inconsolable. I sat in the garden and smoked (which I never do) whilst having what can only be described as a nervous breakdown. He texted me later that day to day how good it had been to see me and how he missed me. If I could go back to that moment and stop myself there I would. Oh god would I. But I cant, and I didn't. And so after a couple of weeks we were back together. And it was like the sadness had suddenly been lifted from me. I was happy for the first time in 4 months. I was elated. I was walking on air.   Now, 8 months down the line, things are worse than ever. But it's different. Because I can't go back to that. How I felt in those four months. I can't. I won't. So now I'm holding on for dear life to this boy who I love more than life itself. To someone who will never be able to return the feelings I have for him. And I'm right back in that place. Wishing I could switch off my humanity. Wanting to be numb. We're together but we're so far apart it's almost unbelievable. How did we get here? From that sickeningly happy couple in the beginning to this. I barely recognise myself when I look in the mirror. Have I lost all self respect? I'm with a man that will only have sex with me in a shower in the pitch black so he doesn't have to look at me, so he can pretend I'm someone else. Who would rather watch porn and wank than have me when I'm in the next room. I'm 27 but I look younger, I'm not one to brag but I'm quite attractive, everyone said he was punching above his weight when we first got together. How did I get here? Is this really all I'm worth?? All I've ever wanted in life is to be happy. And for me, happiness is to love and be loved in return. I don't think that's a lot to ask for.   I look at my friends with their husbands and children or their boyfriends that they live with and I see how happy they are and I ache. I physically ache with longing. I want all those things. But I want them with him. I didn't think it was possible to love someone this much. It's an unrequited love that is slowly killing me and I don't honestly know how much longer I can feel this way for.   I don't expect answers from anyone, I know what I should do. But I'm a shadow of my former self and I don't have the strength or the will to walk away from this person that is eventually going to break my heart for a second and final time.   It's just cathartic to write it all down and throw it out there into cyber space.  
Has any one come out of Melancholic depression or going through it. I need some hope and guidance. 
I cut myself. It's not something I'm proud of but I'm not here so u can tell me I need therapy. I KNOW I need help but this is my way of coping with life.   My friend saw the cuts and I think she's suspicious. She asked me if I cut myself but before I couldn't reply she had to go.   I know she's going to ask me about it again and I need a really convincing lie. I have about 3-6 cuts on either side of my wrists and they're one after the other. I'm only saying this so u can get a full picture and tell me a good excuse.   Plz help me.  
My dad has been going through the cycles of hyperactive and very inactive periods for past couple of years. He has been going to different hospitals and different specialists but some of them say that he has low vitamin B12 deficiency and some of them say he might have "bipolar disorder". We are just wondering what is the best way to figure out what is the cause of this behavior ? I talked to dad this afteroon and he explained everything to me. How he feels. He just said that he feels more vulnerable and is not confident enough when having conversation. He is also afraid that he might do something that can ruin his son's life. He also said he cannot do anything anymore. He is a person who has accomplished a lot in his life and was a man with high confidence. I am very worried. We are now in USA. What type of doctor should be visit ? Any suggestions is highly appreciated.  
Hi everyone, I'm new to this and it's the first time I ever went to the internet for something like this but I think speaking to likeminded people might help. Sorry for the long story in advance ....  I'm 25, originally from Germany but have been living in the UK for a bit more than 3 years now. My boyfriend is British, we met at Uni in the UK.  Back then we were 'friends with benefits' because I didn't want a relationship but we basically were like a couple so when Uni was over and it was time for me to go back to Germany, I realized I really wanted to be with him. We started dating and after some long distance stuff I moved to the UK. We've lived apart and moved in together about 8 months ago. I was really looking forward to the move and living with him.  I've always been kind of obsessive about stuff and every time I had a relationship that was serious, I started ruining it with my thoughts. I broke up with my exes because of other reasons too but the anxiety was a driver/played a role. I just always thought, if you're doubting the relationship then u might as well end it. As soon as i ended the relationships I felt 'free' again, like now I can have all these crazy thoughts without having to control myself because it's not affecting anyone. I never had much anxiety problems while being single, just obsessing about small stuff but never to this extent.   I thought my bad thoughts in a relationship would stop once I found the right partner. I've been with my current bf for almost 3 years now and I know I won't find any better, he does everything for me and Is just great. But about 2 months ago the anxiety started again.  If the relationship had any other faults then I'd just break up again like I always did in the past but it doesn't. So for the first time I'm kind of forcing myself to see this through because I know I'd regret ending it. The relationship is worth fighting for. I think about how my life would be without him and what I'd do and it just doesn't seem worth it.  I want to spend and share my life with him but these thoughts are very strong sometimes and make me wanna do nothing.  He knows everything and I've been talking to my mom a lot as well. It was quite bad before Christmas, then I had some panic attacks and started to realize it can't be him but me. I bought some books about it and felt better, felt like I let it all out.  Now it's back again.  This time I'm thinking a lot about my work and where I am in my life. I started this new job in recruitment 2 months after I moved in with him because I wanted career progression but nothing has moved for 6 months. I feel stuck in my job and like I'm not getting anywhere. When I think back I had my life planned out differently at 25, wanted to have money and savings but I don't.  So I'm stressing about this job and how pointless it is but still, I'm also going back to stress about my relationship and if it's right. I feel like I'm in some major midlife crisis. I know it's not my boyfriend, he isn't doing anything wrong, it's me but I don't know how to stop these thoughts. I've established that my bf is the right thing for me and yet I still can't stop myself from making my work stress all about the relationship again.  I wonder why I'm always reverting everything back to rekatinships, like why can't I just accept it's only about work. I want my life back. I know I need to change my job but that's easier said than done. I feel a lot like I just want to quit it all, get on a plane and run away.... I just want to know if anyone can relate to this and if it'll ever get better. I feel like I know what is wrong and what I need to do but it just seems so far away and out of reach. I feel confused and helpless. My bf knows all this but I also think he gets overwhelmed if I talked about it as much as I wanted to.  It'd be great to hear your thoughts on my story and feeling guys. Thanks a lot 
hi there,  Is anyone on the above meds? They are relatively new to the market here in the UK and just wanted to get any reviews on them. I've just weaned myself off off venlafaxine and was doing really well on supplements but i seem to have crashed - feel really tearful and low.   I thnk the next one to try might be Vortioxetine  Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.  Kerrie  
I wonder if anyone can help I have been suffering with anxiety for years but sadly my mum passed away 3 months ago and I have been recently been more down and crying so the doctor increased my tablets but scared to take it because of the side effects I suffered when started. All the family don't want me to take them too so I'm trying to do meditation but finding it hard I'm thinking I will just have to succumb and take the 40mg? Can anyone help and advise if they will help me?  
I'm 18 years old and as my title suggests I feel like I am currently at my wits' end due to what seems to be a depression with unknown causes. I started feeling down somewhere around 10 months ago, towards the end of my high school career, I was shrouded by apathy and the thought of leaving school and turning my life around produced no excitement whatsoever in me. As time passed and summer approaced, the symptoms worsened considerably to the point where I can now hardly make myself get out of bed and function normally. I have been on medication for the past 7 months, switching from Zoloft to Venlafaxine and maintaining a daily baseline of Tavor, but this has all been to no avail. I have tried to tone down drinking and have quit smoking weed cold turkey (which I'd imagined to be bringing a change of some sort, considering I'd been a daily user for about a year) but this hasn't changed anything either. Therapy has never really been an asset for me, but nonetheless I have been on and off of it for 9 months also, switiching from therapist to therapist and from psycotherapy to psychodynamics but none of this has had a tangible effect on me. it seems like my mind is unavailable/unwilling to receive any external help in spite of my volition to really get ahold of my life again. My symptoms are hard to describe and most of the time I feel like I can't make head or tail of them either. All I can say is I used to be an emotional person who loved being around people and had very many interests. I am now completely uninterested in seeing anyone-except for the friends I have fond memories of and my family-and have utterly given up on taking an active role in what is going on around me. Unfortunately I have made the silly (yet seemingly totally reasonable) decision of moving away from home in a different country for university and starting everything afresh, but I am now as unhappy as ever and have noone to turn to. When I moved I was at the height of my depression, reason for which I did not bring myself to get to know anyone or engage in anything, and what's more I have totally no interest in my degree now. I live in one of the most dynamic cities in the world but long for my natal tiny hometown because nothing about my current city excites me. It feels like anything I do is highly insignificant and unsatisfactory. I often also get instances of depresonalization or something of the sort, where I begin to feel like the world around me is weird and my thoughts become extremely scary: I start engaging in an over-analysis of things to the point where everything (even words) becomes insignificant. I feel stuck in my body, and as if my conscience was constantly splitting itself. these weird thoughts are overwhelming and make me feel even more hopeless. I have forgotten what it feels like to be happy or just carefree or to have feelings towards other people. I am in desperate need of a piece of mind.  
I don't know why, but i am struggling within myself. I  have a doting wife and wonderful loving son. If i could look at my life from above, I would envy what I (we as a family) have. But i find myself struggling. ( I had young trauma). I am 40 yr old.   
Good morning! After 2 years of being on 150mg of ven I decided to try to come off them! Doc advised cutting down to 75+ 37.5 but this made me feel awful! So sick and dizzy! I stuck with it for 2 weeks but decided that I would go cold turkey as it couldn't be any worse and yo be honest it really wasnt! Doc gave me anti sickness pills which really helped! I was also given 2mg of diazapam which help with the zaps and feelings of panic (although i take 4mg as 2mg didnt help! ( Well im on day 4 of cold turkey and no where near as dizzy the night sweats aren't as bad but im def more snappy even though mentally I feel ok ! ! Brain zaps aren't as intense, I feel like im making progress! Surely im ocer the worst?   So im wondering if any one can share they cold turkey experiences/advice with me?  Many thanks in advance xxxx 
 don t know what s going on with me at the moment. I m worried that I m actually losing my mind. One minute I m extremely angry and then I ll be extremely happy and hyper and elevated. Then I ll have periods where I feel completely empty and disconnected. Almost as though I don t know whether I am awake or dreaming. My dreams are incredibly vivid but incredibly mundane- I do normal day to day activities in my dreams and so it is difficult to distinguish between reality. I m finding it more and more difficult to socialise as I don t feel as though I fit in anywhere and I also do not trust anybody. I hate letting people in and so I never open up the anybody, I always feel like I m boring people and that they will eventually just stop bothering with me. I have been feeling this way for a long time and I feel distressed about this. It s making it really difficult to live my life normally and some days I just can t see the point. What is this? 
Hello Everyone, Since last year around June/July 2016 I have been suffering from may be an ear infection or depression/anxiety, I do not know for sure. It started with brain fogs and unable to think clearly. I remember I use to have some frequent cold but I never had this kind of brain fog. Its been 7-8 months now have been to all sorts of doctor, physician ENT, neuro physician but no body takes me seriously. There say its all fine. It first began with fatigue and brain fog(unable to process anything) and then may be an ear problem in my left ear. All my blood reports have been normal and ENT says there is nothing wrong with your ear drum except that it is slightly glued in middle ear. All these symptoms started after about 3 months of joining my first job. During this time I use to watch a lot of movies and shows and would practice speaking in my head, I practised so much that I eventually started affecting my speech. I remember all this began after I woke up one morning with slight pain in my left side of brain because I had been making habit to sleep on my left side since a couple months. I became so conscious of my speech being perfect that I actually started making more mistakes. I would have brain fogs and light headedness and felt that I wasnt feeling as lively as before. At first I went to a physician and complained to him about weak legs and brain fog. After much medicatin and reports he felt that there was nothing wrong with me. I felt that all this might be because of cold in my head and may be all this brain fog was due to ear infection. I went to a couple ENT and they said my ear drum(left ear) is fine but I always felt drumming or beating in my left ear and slight tinnitus. My left ear does not pain but neither does it feel normal. I do not have fever but I always feel that I am not as alert and witty as before. My head feels woozy and slight dizziness and not able to speak as fluently/clearly as before. I have been on anti-depressents, anxiety medicines, antibiotics and what not. I feel I have no serious health issue but still something wrong. This is so depressive and feels like it will never get over.  
As a quick intro: this past week had been terrible, with me being consecutively, and continuously depressed because of some insecurity triggers.  So, this morning, after my boyfriend told me he couldn't deal with me today because of how tired he was from having to deal with me yesterday (our date went wrong, full of breakdowns, he spent the entire day trying to reassure me), I decided I must hold back my emotions, throw it away, and become stone cold and indifferent to as to no longer burden him.  In some other attempt to help my depression as well, I deleted all my social media accounts to detox myself from anymore triggers, but having done so, it left me feeling quite bored and empty. Because of my depression weighing down on me, it was difficult to leave the bed or move, so I couldn't even bother with my hobbies.  So around evening I called him, unsure why. Maybe I was bored, or lonely, or both. I guess I know in my heart I wanted to feel better and be reassured, but at the same time I knew I didn't want to bother him - but I called him anyways.  He said he was free to talk, but we barely spoke. We spent nearly two hours on the phone saying nearly nothing. Eventually, I asked him if he needed to be elsewhere or had things to do. I now find out he actually left his grandma waiting on him for dinner for the past two hours.  I felt awful, shocked a little, and asked him why he'd done that. In sympathy and apology, I told him how I regretted calling him in the first place because I only caused trouble. I became a burden without even knowing it.  He got mad at me. He starts raising his voice. He says he made the sacrifice for me and this is what I give him in return. Then he tells me the reason why he did that was because he believed that if he were to tell me he was busy, I wouldn't be able to take it (in his defense, this has happened many times before).  He was so mad. He says I put him in a spot. I apologized, realized my error for disagreeing with his sacrifice, and felt.. even more awful. Then he becomes sarcastic with me - he threatens to use this against me the next time. He says that next time, even if he knows/believes I can't take it, he would ignore it, because "that's what I want."  All I wanted was to not be a burden to him, so I felt bad because he had to make some sacrifice for me that I didn't even ask for or demand. I wanted to not bother him, but instead, he tells me he leaves his grandma hanging like that because otherwise I wouldn't be able to take it. I want to be able to take it.  I broke down. Inside, at least. I shed tears, but wept silently. Then he had to go, his grandma was calling.  I tried to cut myself. I feel so much pain. I burdened him, made him sacrifice for me - though I didn't ask for it - it's all for naught now. It's all my fault. It always is.  He must hate me. I know it and it hurts so much. I can't cut myself because I'm scared. I'm scared of the scars, the blood, the sting.  I hate him. I want him to stop hurting me. Is he hurting me even? I guess not. It's all just my fault of course. It always is.  
Well ive been depressed for almost more than 2 months and now i feel suicidal i always explain to my parents whats going on they just believe its a teenage strategy and ill get over it sooner or later ive even explained im depressed and they just add on saying no all the time. feels like from now i wanna just die and end all this pain ive lost alot of weight ive stopped doing the stuff i used to do like plah video games.

I hate my life and just wanna die suicides on my mind what do I. 
Over the past month an a half, I have reduced and stopped Lexapro, most recently 19/12/16 from 10mg to 0mg and Lyrica on Sunday gone, reduced from 200mg to 100mg due to issues with weight gain and loss of sex drive and not helping my panic and anxiety attacks.  Anyway, I was also put on 25mg Valdoxan in December.  So between all the switches of drugs and you name it, what was severe anxiety and panic attacks has me now suffering severe depression. My head is all over the shop, I want to break up with my boyfriend because I think he could be causing my depression.  I am under a phychiatrist and phychotherapist, just dont know where to go from here??? 
I had a breakdown last night,again.I think i was nervous all day. and I kinda new that im about to have a mental crisis(yelling crying hitting my self etc)thats why I informed my boyfriend to be more careful. i know he tried but it never helps. I ended up yelling and crying in his car,for sutch a silly reason.I took an anxiolitic(alprasolam) and it helped me calm down and sleep(i always do that) Today im calm but im so depressed it makes me so sad that I cant get out of this misery .. 
I have been diagnosed with a mild form of schizophrenia and I don't know how to deal with my illness no more....my cousin died of cancer and I wish I died instead of him....my boyfriend can't stand me or my illness no more...just like everyone else..everyone leaves me because I am mentally ill....they end up leaving me for someone else that doesn't have problems...I'm in a lot of emotional pain....I don't have the strength anymore to keep fighting....I have no friends or family....everyone hates me..all I have is my mum....and i don't want to be a burden for her....I am feeling really low....I wish I were dead....I feel like no one cares...and things always go wrong for me no matter how hard I try... 
About a year and a half ago I took a lot cocaine which led to me self harming myself as I thought I was going to get killed . I was put into a psychratric ward for 2 weeks. But l went out the other night and I actually heard people talking about me and pointing at me when they was outside and I was inside. I've still got thoughts I'm going to get killed and people are plotting it all. I'm conscious of my family and friends and everyone talking about me  
Aged 18, I can't remember a time where I didn't want to die. Been to doctors and therapists numerous times, never even started to work. Yesterday I was prescriped fluoxetine, 20 MG. At this rate, it's going to be my last try. I just need to be able to hang on for another month or so. I would say I hope it works, but I really don't care. I feel detatched from reality, I guess that's the stand out feature alongside the usual feelings (or lack of). Nothing matters to me, and I mean nothing. Good luck everyone, I hope this isn't what they use to determine the cause of my death 
Mirtazapine appeared to 'poop out' on me around 3 years into my therapy with it. I had been diagnosed with severe depression before going on it I scored almost the maximum on the test. My symptoms were fatigue, nervousness, jumpiness, anxiety, severe depression, insomnia, anorexia, weight loss, itching, migraine, heart palpitations and IBS. The GP tried me on several antidepressants, none of which worked until I tried mirtazapine and it was just amazing. I felt better within days. All of my symptoms disappeared. It was a miracle drug which gave me my life back. Then when it suddenly pooped out my symptoms all came back and I was also diagnosed with chronic kidney disease stage 3. I decided to come off it and tapered off really gradually with very few WD symptoms. I had a period of feeling good again and then wham! All my symptoms returned. I thought I had delayed WD but something in me told me it was a physical illness.  âLong story short, we have a new GP and he's sharp as a pin. Did many tests on me and I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. My sympptoms have become gradually worse and I am pretty ill right now, especially with heart related symptoms. I have been put on carbimazole and propranolol.  âThe purpose of this post is to urge all of you with depression to get your thyroid checked. It can be very dangerous if it is left untreated and is very often misdiagnosed as depression because it shares most of the same symptoms. Both under and overactive thyroid cause depression. Drugs such as mirtazapine can mask the symptoms. I reckon mirt masked my hyperthyroidism until it became so severe that it just couldn't mask it anymore. That's why it appeared to poop out after working so well for so long.  â 
Would anyone know why I can't quit crying? I cry daily unprovoked. I've been on this merry-go-round of meds for ten months now; the last ten weeks on Fluoxetine. Before that, I was on Klonopin and Lexapro...all gave me similar reactions...Today, I feel a heaviness in my head and spacey/numb....I'm not sure how anyone deals with this...don't know how it started or where to go from here...It's like death daily... 
I am 23 year old  male , live in India. After having severe hepatatis A about 32 point serum billurubin 6 years ago in class 10 ,i recovered from it in 3-4 months but during this i got severe depression. There was a lot of negativities in my mind and i have passed my another 2 years of school life spending more time at home. But when i have joined college i donot feel well when i saw many students and i lost my confidence. I have not remembered that moment now but something bad happening. I even talk much without knowing what is going on with me and started getting involve  with my friends but one day my classmates got my fun in the class , upon my mixed language word and language problem and for many days. After that day i decided to not talk much in the class and remain sober and sincere and i was also known that i would change my section in which there were no girls. But most of time my friends take fun about this thing. I escape the college all the time and go to home . My home is far away from my college and i donot want to live in hostel and i have my another house near college and i started living there but i dont feel well without my parents and i went home most of the time. After half a year i consulted to psychiatrist and start taking medication . I was start feeling well but one day my college organised a cultural fest and i was good in music and singing but i donot want to participate in this due to my lack of confidence and even think that my classmates who take fun of my language will take fun of myself during my participation and i created many negative pictures in my mind. This thing got stuck in my mind and i feel bad that i have not participated . But my parents give councelling to me on this thing but i had never told them about my fun in the class. My parents told me to concentrate on studies and leave the extra cultural activities and i start getting away from music and even escape that situation. I again start concentrating on studies and start feeling well. Everytime i have something in my mind and each time i link every situation with that thing. Next year my college again organised a cultural fest and i start escaping the students who are participating and not participated even in the fun event games. Everytime i escape the students of my class and think they can do everything but i cannot and go back to my home escaping them all the time. I have passed my college life in this way but i feel in past i will be ok when i would pass from that college but nothing changes yet . I am still on medications and i am not able do tell eveything to my psychiatrist doctor. l have changed  2 psychiatrist doctor  and this third one does not know my past condition because everytime i have new thought in my mind and everytime i connect everthing with that thought. I feel better at home but when i leave my home i saw my batchmates doing many things in their life and so i started escaping them and go my home . I am escaping all my friends because i thought i am not doing anything and think that my friends are doing many things in their life. I donot want to do anything in my life and want to be at home forever. I donot want to meet with my friends. I want to be at home forever but this is not possible . I am getting afraid as years are passing . When i go out i got depressed seeing many people doing many things thinking positively and doing their jobs. I am not happy and now i donot see any happiness in this world. I am waiting for some magic happens to me and i foget my past and start my new life and no magic happens. What should i do. I think one day i will have to leave from home for a job and getting afraid because i want to live with my parents . I only feel happy in my home with my parents. Study is the only thing i can do and i cannot do any extracurricular activity like music and singing. And i am not getting concentration on my studies due to my thinking patterns. I cannot suicide when i thought about my parents and also i donot have any courage to do it . Full day i get frustated but at evening i get some calm. So what do i do. I want to be at home forever with my parents but this is not possible because i will have to do some work to survive. I even donot want to marry . I think i am doing the work in compulsion and find no interest in anything. Is there any magic?? I am spending all my day with no friends , no productive work and only thinking . I find this is the only way i can express my feelings and waiting for some hope. 
I'm 18 , my jaw pain has spread to my neck and head and it's even harder to open my mouth now. My jaw feels bruised and has knots in it. I've had a barking cough since i had pneumonia in august 2015 and I can't get rid of it no matter what I do. I've gone through all the tests and been told I have a neurogenic cough, the medicine isn't making me feel better and my surgeon said it might be dangerous to have such a major jaw surgery with that barking cough I have. I cry everyday multiple times a day hating myself for not being able to make myself feel better. I had kept trying to keep up with my activities for the 15 months since I've been like this but now I don't want to get out of bed or attempt to do anything anymore. I'm up all night unable to try to sleep knowing that I've failed myself and i sleep all day not wanting to wake up. My jaw is causing me so much pain and the coughing isn't helping it. The coughing is really harsh and hard on my jaw and makes me feel breathless sometimes. But everything is normal!! They say. I haven't been happy since 2015 and I keep wanting to die but I'm also afraid of death. I don't think I really want to die but I don't want to live either. I can't deal with this pain and cough and deep sadness anymore.  
I was first diagnosed with anxiety and then also depression. I have been going through this about six months but they have not found anything. I still refuse medicine but I did try CBT. CBT feels like it wasnt working. My question is now Im having shortness of breath off and on and I have been to the emergency room twice and nothing. I have had lung blood work, to CtScans and a million chest xrays. Is there anyone who experiences shortness of breath as a symptom of depression or anxiety? 
Hi ive been feeling really down over the last week well over the last 4 months really after being told i have gallstones and now have to have surgery on my gallbladder. But over the the last week ive been feeling so down and it has been getting worse. Im just so sick and tierd of being ill for this long and waiting for long for surgery. I just want my life back i was crying all day yesterday and the day before and its now starting again today. I already have depression and anxiety so being ill has really made this alot worse. Some days it feels i can handle it even with the pain there but over the last week and 2 days have been the worst ever, ive been so upset all the time i keep thinking the worst is going to happen aswell. My pain meds are not working very well and im on meds for depression and anxiety and there not working very well. I still feel so down all the time and i even have people who help me with this but they are of sick at the moment  Since being ill it has taken over my life and has made everything worse. I was doing a little better before all this happend but being ill for this long and the waiting to get better is just making me so upset now. Sorry for going on about it for so long how does other people deal with this and what kind of things do you do to get through it any advice please would be nice thankyou x 
Hi.  I've suffered from depression on and off since I was 16. I'm 31 now. Even though I had bouts of self harm and suicidal thoughts when I was a teen, I feel from my 20's to present it's been getting worse.  Some background; I live with my father, who I've had a strained relationship since 2010 after he ignored my pleas to call an ambulance when I fell down the stairs. I caught him violently attacking my mother when I was 16, he's selfish, bad tempered. Why live with him, I bet you wonder. He's ill now, Altzeimers (excuse the spelling). I've wanted to move out, despite my attachment to the family house, but feel guilty about abandoning him. I only have a sister, who lives in another country and isn't interested in seeing him again.  Basically I feel trapped in a life I really despise. I hate going to work, but it's a break from home which I hate even more. I don't sleep well. My only respite is a few hours out with my best friend on a Friday (who used to come to the house for longer before my dad started to freak her out), and my mother on a Saturday. I dread going home and yet I feel the need to go back everytime I'm out since I fear the worst will happen.  I've always wanted to be a writer and publish, but I can't concetrate. It's not that I'm always miserable or distant. Last night my dad told me I needed sleep, but then decided to play his TV at max volume till midnight and so I snapped. I've done this before, screamed into a sheet/pillow/, crawled into a ball on the floor... and once done sobbed for an hour. I can't live like this anymore. I feel selfish because I hate him and he's ill, why I hate him is because of what he's done before then. I don't feel like I have anything to live for. That this is my life until he dies, or I kill myself. Something I'm solely tempted to do, luckily I have a fear of death so...   I've finally gotten an appointment with my GP after months of trying, I'm not optomistic. Last time I tried I was waiting 6 months to see a therapist 1 hour a week for a set time. My mother who has also suffered depression tells me I need anti-depressants too. Neither will really cure my feeling of resentment and being trapped. I hate my life. I feel like a failure, still living at home and secretly hoping I'll get to have it to myself (I know, I'm a horrible person), not even bothering to achieve my only dream...etc. I've already bored you so I wont' go on.  Last place I tried nobody really responded, at most got a sad emoticon response. Apart from a very likely dismissive GP next week, I don't feel like I have anywhere else to turn to. 
I have been feeling extremely down and horrible about myself lately. I feel hopeless, useless and not worthy of anything. Even though I have two jobs, I feel lonely in the world. My husbands visa has not come through and its been two years. That worry on my mind is taking over my life and it makes me feel so angry that I can't do anything to even push this. I feel useless. I'm always angry at everyone and tired as I can't sleep at night as I'm always crying and getting mixed emotions about everything.  I don't know what to do. I think I need help before I do or say something that I will regret.  
hi has anyone got experience of citalopram I've been on it 3 years now and lately I've not been feeling no good.I feel detached emotionless I've got no sex drive or no interest in anything.I'm tired all the time and my sleep is restless constantly broken I often wake up soaked in sweat.  thanks

Hello Everyone  After being on different anti-dâs for years and years, I was on venlafaxine for 5 years and it stopped working last year. I managed to wean myself off of them and tried supplementing with a concoction of l-tyrosine, B6&magnesium, Omega3, Folic and 5-HTP.  This combo worked a treat for a few weeks but now its pooped out and I seem to be gaining a bit of weight too!!   My mood has really plummeted over the past week â its like Iâve gone from a high to very lowâ¦..     The next resort for anti-depressants would be Vortioxetine.     I just wanted to know if anyone has any success on this new drug?     Iâd be keen to see what peoples view on it is     Thanks  Kerrie  
Ive been diagnosed w/dysthymia (persistent depression), anxiety (general/social) and recently PTSD (past traumatic events that bring on incressed anxiety).  Was with my BF for 8 months, both of us have depression/anxiety and both "deal" in different ways. The first half of our relationship was amazing, I thought I had a better grip on things when we met, we were both honest about our depression and it was comforting to be with someone who understood.  Since Oct things have been building for me (stressors) and in Nov he had somewhat of a breakdown himself. I began feeling like he was disconnecting from me, didnt talk as much, he never went into details about things, I started to think it was me (my insecurity, not good enough, not "positive" enough.  To sum this up (for now). We started to get into minor disagreements (change in plans) that hurt me more than it probably should because he was the only thing good in my life so when plans would change I took it as he must not care to see me, etc I would try to explain why I felt the way I did in an attempt for him to understand how my brain works but he took it as him not being a good boyfried, making me unhappy, and not good enough himself, which was never my intention. A little over 2wks things had been going pretty good and he changed plans on me and when I told him how it made me feel he immediately said he cant do this anymore, this is unhealthy and broke up with me.  Since Ive been totally lost and have taken steps (new therapist, on a waitlist for an intesive outpatient prog., etc) but I feel Im to blame because I let the depression/anxiety get out of control and should have done this back in Oct when first noticed changes in me. He has talked me a few times on the phone since, not sure if he thinks this is all because of him or if understands it kinda just topped it all off since he was the only good thing I had going/to look forward to (and he would say the same about me).  Not sure if its best to just stay away or if trying to (in email) explain why I am the way I am, how I get at times, how I react when feeling a certain way? Hes pretty told me to not hold onto hope of us getting back together, its stuck in his head that this will just keep happening, we'll keep fighting. He still wants to be friends and says he'll be there since he knows I dont have any other "real" support but Im afraid of pushing him away even more when I do reach out.  Not sure what to do, feeling pretty much paralyzed the last week+ . Obviously Id like to get back together and wish we could look at this as a learning/growing experience but I feel so...hopeless.   
About 2 years ago my son was diagnosed with depression, which seems to be getting worse. He left Uni because he was just breaking down all the time and since then seems to be acting incredibly guilty as if he has failed us. This is not the case as I really dont care what he does as long as hes happy, he now works in a pub but every night he comes home has a joint which when confronted he says is the only thing that calms him down. I know he is going through this hell and I dont want him to be coping by himself. I myself am Ex Military and from a stupid almost victorian Dad point of view thought that hed grow out of it if he occupied himself with distractions ie girlfriend study etc. well hes got all that and still has this stress in his life. I know there is no easy way to flick a switch to make this all go away, but would be extremely grateful for any advice. Particularly in how to advise him to seek medical help and stick with it, at the moment he has taken prescribed pills and had councilling, however after a few weeks he drops it saying it doesnt work. In addition any thing you recomend a parent that seems to be useless at helping can do I would be so grateful. 
My boyfriend has always had bouts of depression, when he does he leaves the house and moves out back to his parents but this usually only lasts for a few days and comes back to normal. This time he moved out and left 5 weeks ago now and told me he needs to get seriously better because he's lost himself, he sees a counsellor once a week and he started taking tablets a couple of weeks ago. I've seen him twice in 5 weeks so I've had to cope being on my own in the house. I text him everyday wanting to help and try to understand it more so he doesn't have to leave to go to his parents each time, most days he will just go mad at me which makes me angry and we have an argument. He asks me to leave him alone and give him space but I just find it so hard and only text to see if he's doing ok. He now doesn't know whether he wants to be with me anymore all because I've cared and text him when he's asked me to give him space. Does anyone know what I can do? Shall I give him the space like he's asked? Do you think it's the depression talking? How can I help him? I have suffered with depression myself but only mild so I can't understand the severe side of it that he's feeling and I'm feeling very confused. All I want to do is help :-(. 
I've been battling depression now for nearly 2 months ( I do have a history spanning 20 years but it's 14 since I've had to take time off work because of it). Initially I tried escitalopram which I've had before with no side effects but this time it made me so sick and gave me insomnia and I couldn't function. I then tried Setraline and that had the same effect. At that point I decided to try and manage it myself and over Christmas did feel better. By beginning of January I was back at the GP asking to try another anti depressant. I was started on 10mg Fluoxetine and managed to tolerate it, felt more positive and generally better but as that was within a few days of starting it I think it was more relief that I could tolerate the drug rather than its therapeutic effect. Two weeks later I increased to 20mg, had some scary panic attacks and heightened anxiety but that settled. However 2 weeks after the dose increase I started to have panic attacks again, one frightened me so much last Thursday as it came with really dark almost suicidal thoughts. I spoke to GP who lowered the dose to 10mg. I was so anxious and scared of having more dark thoughts that GP also prescribed me small amount of diazepam which I've used sparingly and the anxiety had resolved. Monday I was feeling better but yesterday was the worst I've had in terms of depression- I felt so low that I had to take to my bed in the early evening. I've never done that before as I will usually force myself to do things in the hope I'll feel better. I'm trying to work out if I'm feeling so low because of the drop in dose of the Fluoxetine or in the aftermath of experiencing the dark thoughts which has really upset me. I feel like it's one step forward, two steps back. I just want to feel better and get back to normal. I am also having counselling and am on waiting list for CBT via local IAPT. I'm doing more exercise than I normally would I still I feel awful. I've just spoken to my GP and am going in later to discuss if I try yet another antidepressant. I can't bear the thought of being faced with side effects that I can't tolerate yet again.  
I have found I rely on music a lot during my depression to lift my mood, especially when I am feeling exceptionally hopeless or sad.  What music or artists have helped uplift you in dark times? 
Got my MRI results a few days ago and been struggling to cope since.  following my prev posts i have had lower back pain for the last year. i see an osteopath every month at the moment to try and get on top of it. i was referred by my gp to the pain clinic. in short he advised painkillers and keeping mobile. i requested a MRI which he agreed to do, i had that on the 22nd December 2016.  Only received the results last thursday. so in short i have mild  hypertrophy of the lower lumbar facet joints and an element of disc dehydration at the  L4/L5 level. all of which is wear and tear and would be inkeeping of my age.   i have no issue with this part of the report. kind of knew it would show something.  Then it says i have a pelvic tilt, this could be associated with hip disease or a shortening of your left leg. None of the above part was expected and i would not have known about it unless i requested the MRI.  Any one had this and what was your outcome? struggling to see my GP as i want to stay with the same one for continuity. i rang this morning and she is fully booked, i could have cried!  Really struggling with this as i have no idea what it means and i am scared of the outcome.  Hip replacements and Shortened Legs run in the family too.  Ugh just fed up! 
Hello,   I have suffered from depression and generalized anxiety disorder now for around 7 years and have gone untreated without counselling or medication the whole time. I have chosen to write a post here because as a sufferer of health anxiety as well, I know how frightening it can be to start taking medication. I literally looked at every post i could on the internet about Mirtazapine, I guess I was putting off taking them but every story I read was negative and reinforced the terror I felt about taking them.   Until one night, I took my first tablet and lay awake waiting for the horrendous side effects. I admit, I did feel overly anxious and had multiple panic attacks but this wasn't due to the medication.   Day after day I waited for side effects to happen but I can happily say I have had none. I have experienced the weight gain but Im currently bulking and exercising due to new found motivation. I've taken them for  6 weeks now and I'm no longer suicidal, my depression has lifted and I no longer feel hopeless. I'm not 100% yet but Im in a MUCH better place than I was 6 weeks ago. I was literally suicidal.   I hope that someone reads this and finds some sort peace of mind. I was miserable before, I now get more moments of happiness than sadness and I'm glad I took the leap. I know how terrifying it can be to start medication but you never know, it just might work for you!   Thanks for reading,  Liam  
I was diagnosed with depression about 2 years ago, while living overseas. Treatment was hard but after a year of medication and therapy I felt much better than I had in years. I went off my meds about 4 months ago (with no negative side effects) and stopped therapy (which, although I missed it, I saw very few negative consequences as a result).  Then, 6 weeks ago, I had to move back home. I'm not where I want to be, my career options here are greatly limited, i'm far away from my friends (especially hard, because i'm not sure I ever had real friends before treatment), and I'm back living with my parents as an adult. And, as a result,  i'm pretty much miserable most of the time... with irrational angry outbursts thrown in. Nothing interests me any more, and I simply cannot imagine ever being as happy here.  I'm pretty sure my depression is back. I have an appointment with a new psychiatrist next week and i'm sure i'll be back on my meds soon enough. But part of me feels like this is just a normal response to such a big change in my circumstances. For a while there, and for the first time in my life, I had (or was working toward having) everything I wanted, but now that is all gone. I guess I feel like, the meds are going to artificially lift my mood but, in reality, I'll still never feel truly happy or hopeful like that again because I no longer have those things that helped me to see my life as worthwhile when I was going through treatment the first time.  So, I guess my question is whether it is even worth going on the medication again, or whether I should I instead just try to accept that this is how my life is now, and just learn to live with the (soul-crushing) disappointment? Aren't the meds just going to mask the reality of my situation, when what I really need to do is accept it?  Does this make any sense? 
Hi all i have come to the conclusion I am a waste of space and the air that I breath.  am getting closer and closer to the end.  Been sellling stuff or literaly  giving it away, seen my grand daughters 6th birthday arranged lunch out with a friend later this week, haven't seen for a while. Don't  say talk to some one, ended up at the Dr's the other night as i was drviing down a tunnel to my death nextt hing I knew I was at the surgery asking to see someone even  though it was after 5.30 it was somewhere safe to go.Spent at least an hour there being calmed down and talking out stuff even the Dr opened up to me about how he coped with things. Spoke to the Samaritians last night after out driving like a loon sitting there with a load of drugs to take didn;t but it was there. These thoughts won't go away, evne when working going through the motions just to keep people happy. Do I really want to die that is the million dollar question? I don't know? I hate who I am, who I was, things I;ve done or had done to me I have been trying to change but these thoughts palns etc etc just don;t seem to go away. Difficult to describe explain put on paper put into words, how do I try and get out or off this roundabout until I understand it myself or expalin it to someone. Seeing Dr and psychiatrist this week too, do I print this off write stuff out and just hand it to them easier than trying to say it or hiding it. don't want to go into hospital again but maybe that might be the safest place to be? These thoughts jsut suddenly appear and  I react without thinking. I know some day I will not ring someone and just do it, the it being kill myself. There I;ve said it. It won't be tonight or tomorrow but the date is getting nearer and nearer. Don't all panic it isn't going to be now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you all take care out there and thank you all for your support. Love you all and best wishes  Tina xx 
Hey there.  I'm a 22 year old (23 in December) male and being a virgin depresses me to such an extent that it's hindering me from getting on with life; I spend so much of my time masturbating on a consistent basis and easily get distracted due to sexual-frustration. It's ineffable me to describe how badly it's affecting my life. I'll provide a bit of backstory about me to give you guys/girls a better understanding of myself. Most people would never guess I'm a virgin by the way. I've been told I'm confident, charming, and flamboyant.  I was bullied as a child and as a result hung around the wrong kind of people in my teenage years just to fit in. I was living a lie until I was 19 or so; hung around the wrong people, do things to fit in with others. and lived in foster care for a few year. I have never met my real dad but who know he lives abroad. I have 5 siblings who live in foster-care at the moment. I currently live with my mom and recently left my job due to stress but have enrolled on a personal-training course to build on my qualifications and hopefully make a career out of, albeit I'd need a part time job on the side. One reason I didn't do my personal training sooner is because  I had a really bad injury on my shoulder and still suffer from muscle imbalance on that site-but if people on wheelchairs can be decent personal, trainers, I can too, right? I'm fit and healthy for the most part and have no problems performing everday tasks, just heavy lifting is a problem, but I'm learning to live with it. I'd like to think I am "my own person now". In the last few years I've made a few real friends. I'm popular. Despite this I wouldn't feel comfortable telling anyone in the world about this.  Society frowns upon virgins, particularly if they're male. I've had a girlfriend when I was a lot younger but we wern't ready for ready for sex at the time. I've been single for the last 5 years or so due to a variety of  factors. A few people have confessed to me in the last six months, however,  I did not find them attractive; now I did consider seeing them because it'd give me a chance to solve my problem-but decided that it would be unfair on both of us, and I really wouldn't want to commit to a relationship that I didn't think would last. So yes, I declinded their offer.   And it's most definitely not my looks the reason I'm still a virgin, I've been told that I am attractive a multitude of times; as flattering as this is, it makes the fact that I'm a virgin even worse. I'm kind of small for a guy but a lot of people find me attractive; albeit most of them are either in a relationship, or I'm not attracted to them, or if I am attracted to them to want to have sex with them, they'd expect to have a relationship after the sexual encounter, and I wouldn't want that unless they were attractive AND right personality wise. I know I'm being picky. I'm also really nervous because  I'm inexperienced.  I once went to a massage parlour and tthis attractive thai woman provided me with oral-sex; she said she'd be willing to have sex with me if I paid her £60 next time. While I did consider it, I think it'd mentally-destroy me in the long run; yes, it would help temporarily, but the fact that I'm an attractive person and had to pay for something I could get for free would just make my life even worse. At one point I was considering suicide, albeit this was a few years ago when my social life was dead. I'm not overly fond of clubbing but it is a decent way to get to meet new people and I do go out sometimes with a few friends. There was this one girl that actually offerred me sex too at a club, but she was VERY unnatractive and the kind that was showing EVERY guy attention. However, if she was attractive, I would have obliged despite her unrefined manner. I'm a cynical person but I'm open minded at the same time. Basically I would have been sick if I went through with it, but I DID consider it. Random girls have kissed me full on too on night outs. They imposed themselves on me too. If I did something like that I'd be labelled a pervert.      I just want to experience, sex, you know? I guess that's normal for someone my age. So many people in worse circumstances than mine have enjoyed sex, and I haven't. I know it's a pathetic reason to be depressed about.   Back when I was a carer for an infirm relative and consequently a hermit my social life was beyond-atrocious; after I stopped being a carer and got a shop my life did significantly get better.  At the moment the only thing that keeps me going is that I know that  people have it worse than me. There are millions of virgins out there who probably that get no where near the same amount of attention as me, but I'm me, I'm a flawed individual that is mentally-unstable despite my positive-demeanour. Not one of my friends would ever be able to tell I have this problem.   I don't know what I'm expecting from this site? I've read copious amounts of books on how to deal with depression etc etc But I don't think anything other than having sex with someone will solve this. And I want to do it while I'm still young and decent looking. Before someone mentions dating sites I'd not feel comfortable uploading my picture on there partially due to the fact that people I know may use them.  At the moment this is how I view things:  I considering hiring an escort everyday to get it done with. No moral obligation to go out with her after that, Get it done with. Fun. But I know it'd destroy me mentally. I'm already depressed enough about this matter.  Have sex with a friend and risk screwing up our friendship.  Have sex with someone I'm not attracted to.  Or wait to meet a girl I like, and be a couple and have sex whenever! If only the world worked like that.   It'd be pretty cool if there was a girl I found attractive in the same position and we went from there. But if I wouldn't admit to anyone I know, why would anyone else? 
On the 18th December, 2016, I took my last Lexapro and within days, I started feeling excessively tired and in January I got very sick with infections and have been really low.  A week ago my Lyrica was reduced from 200mg to 100mg due to weight gain.  My head is all over the shop at present, OMG.. so low.  Having death visions of like me drowing in a lake or hanging in a shed, all really dark, low thoughts.  How the hell do I get out of this??  Want to give it a go without the Lexapro (SSRI's) as I have been on them 10 years on and off for GAD and hear very bad reports about Lyrica for weight gain and brain fog... 
I talk to myself. It's not like I'm reminding my myself to do something out loud but rather that I have full on conversations with myself. Like I'll say something to a friend or someone and then in my head I'll reply to what I myself said.    For expample:  Me (out loud): Hey Christine (one of my school friends) did we have any math homework  Me (in my head): Seriously? Did we have any homework? You (as in ME) made it sound like the only reason you're friends with her is so she can tell you what homework you have.   And then I feel horrible because I feel like maybe Christine'll think I'm only friends with her so she can help me out with school    I refer to the "Me in my head" as the Other Me. Is that crazy?   Any advice? 
I'm 23 and wish I was dead. I'm tired of forcing myself to appear happy and present around people. I have extremely low confidence and low self esteem. People tell me how pretty I am but I still feel ugly and dumb. I wish I could love myself enough to see what they see but I can't. I have bulimia and starve myself almost always I've lost like 40 pounds. And at this point it's  not even to look good it's just the pain inside of me gives me a some sort of relief. I know I need help but I don't know where to begin.  
had an emergency come up that cost me almost 10,000 and i didn't have the money. but i had a prepaid college fund that i had access too that had just enough to cover the emergency. i spent days thinking if i should take it out, or sell my car or anything else. but right now, the right thing was to use the prepaid college fund, because i need my car to get to work. So i used it. and now im just sitting, feeling hopeless. like i now really have nothing. no future. my whole future and plan was to go to school. but now i cant. i'm not just some 18 year old who has a lot of time to save, im 24, i have a house i rent, a full time job that i hate. theres no way i could afford school. and i wouldn't be able to get a loan because i was not that great of a student in hgih school because i just didn't care.  i just feel like my whole life is now ruined. i will be stuck doing this crappy job that i hate forever. i will never get to fufill my dream and go back to school. just a hopeless feeling. 
Hi i have been feeling really down as to being so ill for over 3 months now. I have had anxiety for years which at the moment has got alot worse to i also get help for all this but at the moment its still really hard to deal with and i still feel really bad. I also just found out i have gallstones and now waiting for gallbladder surgery which has also effected my liver to. I have not been able to do much as to being so ill recently which has really got me feeling down and low. Im in pain all the time from feeling so ill. but it is also caused me to have alot more panic attacks. I just hate feeling like this i mean its one thing being ill with gallstones but feeling so down and having anxiety with it aswell is so hard  and i feel that sometimes people dont understand the way you feel, and i feel the longer i have been waiting for the surgery the more anxiety and feeling down has got worse. I just want to feel abit more normal again. I used to feel some days were better then others but since getting ill it has brought everything back but worse   I just hope that after the surgery i might feel abit better in myself aswell. Does anyone else feel like this. would be nice to speak with others so any feed back and advice would be great thanks. 
I've never posted anything like this before. I'm 29 and I work in a high-pressure, insular industry. For about 6 months now my self confidence has deteriorated to the point where I ruminate every single moment of the day about how I am perceived by others. Every time I make a mistake I want to cry, I feel embarrassed and ashamed of myself all day long, like I can't get anything right and like I'm a total waste of space. I've lost almost all my friends, (not through lack of trying - I'm always the last one to reach out) which I'm pretty sure is because I'm so nervous, awkward and always say the wrong thing. I can't get through one day without doing something stupid and kicking myself over it later, everyone around me seems so smart and together and they must think I'm such a mess. The people I have left I'm worried will see how I'm changing, and won't be around much longer. I try and push myself to go out but I'd really rather just be alone so nobody can judge me. I can't see an end to this feeling, I used to always be myself and screw the consequences, I had friends and I was sure that I was a good person with a bright future but now I care so much what's being thought of me I don't know who I am anymore. I feel like I can't be inside my own was anymore, especially as I hate my stupid self so much. I want to be successful but I can't get past this weirdness that puts everyone off. And it's not just myself I feel this way about, I can't help but think negatively about everyone. I'm pretty sure my mind is playing tricks on me, but part of me thinks maybe I'm finally seeing myself and everything the way it really is. I'm confused and my mind doesn't stop. I've been to the doctor and I'm having counselling but it's not helping at all. What should I do? Am I going crazy? I really worry that I'm going to lose myself completely! I don want to waste anyone's time but I had to get some of this out of my head. 
I have had mild depression and anxiety since  i recall memory.  It was due to poverty at home and colitis and IBS.  once we that perfect rays of health and wisdom are radiating from our Source of being (soul) and that is what sustains us ,   These rays flow throuh mind and then brain where negativity blocks/hampers normal expression of vitality in terms of health , beauty and wisdom. So medication can be a relief.  But if one attunes/keeps centrered on inherent perfection which is at source of all of us, we can avail our Spiritual Resource which is available to all of us.  To avail this Resource takes persistent (yes, it has to be done with absolute unbreaking perseverance) despite difficult situations. And one has to do it by oneself. (Just as to stregthen one's body, one has to exercise oneself, no one else can do for oneself).  one should never give up on Divine Faith. Never give up. AND brain cells do improve. Of course, the change is exteremely slow. it can so slow as to be impreceptible but it definitely changes.  Maintaining Calmness in brain is important.  Conserving vital essence (sexual fluids ) and transfeering same energy into brain is of great help. ( i can testify it from male perspective)     
I really don't want to live anymore.  I'm alone but do have some friends.  Have a grown daughter that has a busy life and no time for me.  I think people would be sad and miss me, but not terribly.  They'll get over it.  I recently had major surgery and it went well.  Not life threatening.  Yet I am so very sad and just don't want to continue.  I have no reason to be be depressed but I am and I just don't want to face another day.  I was seeing a therapist until 2 weeks ago when he released me.  I'm very good at hiding my true feelings from everyone.  If you so me at work or with friends you'd think I was a happy go-lucky person.  It's all a front.  I'm not looking forward to anything.  I just want to die.   I'm not in danger of hurting myself, I just want to be dead.  I'm so tired.  So tired of living. 
Hi,  Firstly I'd like to say thanks in advance for any help. Anyway, so for the past few months at college I've been bullied by a group of 6 people, they call me names etc and mock how my forehead is really big and say I have a receding hairline, this really gets me down. I have a girlfriend too and we have problems sometimes which also gets me down. My mum passed away in 2015 and all I do is think about her and I get upset and more depressed. I can't find an apprenticeship, I've been looking for months. Today, my dad found out I'd been skiving college and he's in a really bad mood with me and he's annoyed. Just yesterday, I went to church to see if that helped with things and it did, people were really friendly and I had a conversation with the vicar about my mum and she was really helpful, I've decided that I'm going to go to church every Thursday to this vicar as she said you're welcome to come back whenever and have another chat, going to church definitely helped but I'm still not happy at all because of loads of things affecting me. What do I do? 
I've been feeling depressed for a while now. Life has become unbearable and recently I have had a constant responsibility of being there for a suicidal person - talking them out of killing themselves has become a nightly thing. I care deeply about this person, and I want to keep helping them, but I'm constantly so mentallt drained and tired that I find it difficult and I'm afraid it's driving them away from me. I don't feel like I can deal with living any more, and I honestly feel like death is the only solution to my situation - yet I can't, because someone else's life practically depends on mine. I've resorted to self harm, but this gives little relief as it's only temporary. I know I need help and I want help but it's difficult to reach out because the people around me have such stigma about mental health etc. I don't know what to do and it's killing me. Help? 
I'm attracted to people that are not normal. Who wants to be normal anyways that's boring. I'm different  
I was put on a higher dose of antidepressants today and I took one at 5pm. I went to bed at 11pm and when I closed my eyes to try and sleep I went into a dream like state with flashing images going through my mind. I could move and open my eyes and get comfy but as soon as I closed my eyes again, back into dreams. They are stopping me from getting into an actual sleep. It's now 3am and I still can't get to sleep. Could this be my new antidepressants doing this? I need advice what to do, I have a 7 month old and he'll be up in 3 hours and I've still not slept� 
 Im a 22 year old girl.I have a problem whith anger and anxiety.When i get angry i cant controll my self, i cry,yell and hit myself as hard as i can.I tried to talk to my parents but theyre not that suportive eather.my fiance in the other hand seems very kind and loving but when i get all these crises,he just gets anoyed and makes it worse,because i feel abandoned from the most important person in my life.I wanted to go to a shrink but i live in a town where everyone knows everything and to be honest im ambarrased of it,people thinking that im crazy or something.I dont have anyone to talk to.These crises hapen very often,sometimes twice a month,i started taking sleeping pills a lot ,i even tried to end my life.I dont really know what kind of condition is this but is hurting me and the people around me.Last night it happend the same thing and my fiance told me that he is sick of this thing and told me to take carr of my self vecause i have problems.I font know what to do,please if someone had the same excperience,id be very thangul to talk to.. 
Im a young girl.Three years now i'm excperiencing something awful and embarrasing,i would say.When i get angry with my boyfriend,i cry and yell and hit my self,better said i act like a pshycho(i'm so sad to actually use these words). All of this happens in front of him,very often,dometimes avery two weeks. Before my crisis start I have a sensation in my chest that i cant control,like a black strong evilness that tries o come out.I say bad things to him and sometimes i have hit my self so hard i started bleeding. The problem is that all of those things hapen for some silly reason and eaventhough i know that,i cant stop. The same thing happend in front of my parents,but they dont really understand what im going through and made it very clear that I dont have their support. My boyfrend seemed caring,until last night when another crisis hit me and he told me that he was very sick of it and doesnt want to know about it anymore(i really cant blme him either). I have problems sleeping,so Ive been taking sleeping pills now.Im only 22,i have everything,i know people are in so much worse situations than this,and thats why i feel even more guilty about my position. I havent been to a shrink yet,here where I live we dont really do that(visiting a pshyciatrist),plus I dont have the money. It's so depressing and i'm sick of it.I dont have anyone to talk to.  
i need to talk to someone and i have no one, i was in an abusive relationship for 7 years, i eventually have the courage to leave him, he stocked me and never left, i finally found the man of my dreams, and now after 10 months after everything we have been through he leaves, i feel i am going into depression again my medication is not helping me anymore, i am thinking Sucidial thoughts , i want to hurt myself. i wish i could die 
I don't know what to do. I have had depression before but learnt to manage it. It's so difficult at the moment as it's been going on for 2 years now. He got himself into thousands of pounds of debt through drinking in the 2 years since we bought our house. I am trying to stay with him but I have been there for him for so long and all I asked for is a phone call today and he's just ignored me. He's probably drinking. I'm staying at my parents house at the moment as he is so hard to live with and every time he drinks he changes personality and we get into a fight. His OCD has got a bit better now but it's still so hard to live with. I don't know if things are ever going to get to a place for a long term relationship? And when I need help with things he doesn't seem to want to which makes me feel even worse and lonely.  
I am so fed up now......  Still waiting for my MRI results and generally feel crap!  Feels like the citalopram isnt working but i know it is. Anxiety isnt helping either!  Ugh just need to sleep all the time......... 
My husband was left disabled after a cancerous tumor to his spinal cord . He has also experienced sequelle from side effects of 4 rounds of chemo.This includes diabetes,prostate cancer requiring prostate removal,ED secondary to that.Paralysis X 1 year,and partial numbness thereafter . He also had the "largest hernia" this doctor ever repaired without opening him up totally . He also had a heart attack requiring a triple bypass.This Started about 12 weeks after the birth of our third child . He has experienced depression after the paralysis .We are people of faith and that has helped us quite a bit but you can't have all this happen and not have it affect you . I tried to get him to go to counseling but he won't . On a daily basis he is very controlling to help him compensate for his feeling of lack of control  He comes from a base of anger so is easily angered and looks for fault and suggest fault in his tone of voice . I love this man and want to find a way to help him through his anger . He won't take traditional medications for depression . We talked to his Dr.,he put him on a medication .He took 1 dose ,that's it .Wont take meds . I recommended a support group even if on line . He just sort of smiled at me like " You silly woman",so coming to you all for suggestions . I love him dearly but he was not alone on this journey and is not now  . I would like to increase his(and therefore my) happiness guita .Any ideas welcome.�

I went to the ER where they said my gallblader is full of stons ... they scheduled surgery after a month and a half bcuz my body was tired from birth so I had to wait ... during this time my parents took care of the baby ...

I had my little boy over a year ago. I didnt leave the house for almost a month and I was terrified of EVERYTHING! I go to school now and I just got on the pill (lol finally!) Anyways, regular depression started back in June 2011 due to a abusive stepdad, that my mom is still married too because if we leave he'll come find us. I guess this is more of getting things off my chest, I do know I have depression. I struggle to get of bed in the mornings, play with my son, or talk to my boyfriend about stuff because I have no motivation at all! I want to tell my doctor but I doubt she'll do anything. Any advise? 
I have been depressed for about 3 weeks now.  I tried talking to my parents about this but my mom said that I was stressed because my final exams are in 2 weeks. When I sleep it takes me at least 2 hours to sleep. This is been going on for an year now. Sometimes at night I feel someone is in my room which freaks me out. Even if I have a good day and i dont think about something scary I can't sleep. I really can't concentrate on my studies. Whenever I open my books I cannot focus on it. That's not it. I feel bad almost everyday. I feel like I cannot accompalish anything. I feel like I will just have rejections in my life.  I have many friends I talk to them but still can't feel better.  Please help me.  
I am in desperate need of help.  I'm 37 and have been depressed for as long as I can remember.  I've been through so much, but any happiness that I find is so short lived.  I've been able to build what looks like a normal life but I am so sad and hopeless.  I have no friends to talk to, don't trust my family, and have been through many counselors with no luck.  I'm on my 2nd marriage at this point but the relationship is not the love that I want... I got married to him because we have a daughter together and I want my daughter to have a normal family, but we are on the verge of divorce.  I dont feel he understands me whatsoever, and makes me feel worse that the one person who should get me doesn't and I feel even more alone and issolated.  I  just feel immensely sad and hopeless and pointless.  I try to live for my toddler daughter but even that's not enough... I have been crying my eyes out all morning in front of her which makes me feel even worse, but I can't seem to stop.  I don't know what I'm to hoping to accomplish with this post.  Guess I'm hoping for a miracle because all I see tells me everyone in this world would be better off without me.  I am against anti depression medication for many reasons... I have to make myself happy on my own but I'm so lost.  Really need a friend and someone who understands. 
Me & my boyfriend were together for 7 years,  we'd been through ivf which worked first time but had alot of medical problems afterwards and throughout pregnancy, we now have a 7 month old, he was always cold and distant I can't pinpoint when it started maybe after our son was born, after a few arguments he left and told me it was depression he has lost his feelings in general and definetly the love. I always left the door open for the past 3 months & he said he wanted to get better and come back to us, he's fine with his friends etc just seems like most of his anger and coldness is towards me, 2 weeks ago I found out he has a new girlfriend, the week before he was spending everyday here for a few hours and seemed more himself, asking to keep our embryos frozen because it was time to pay for storage and gave me hope,  then a few days later I found out about the new girlfriend,  he says he feels bad about everything he's done, iv spent the last few months not eating/sleeping and crying all day long whilst looking after our child, my question is has the love really gone? Could his feelings ever come back? & & he says he's happy now in this new relationship that's All he cares about, is that real or is it just a case of them being in the honeymoon period? If anyone on either side of the situation could give me there experience that would be brilliant, I feel like I stood by and waited through his depression but now I'm the one alone and hurt.  
Good Evening everyone...Its been a while since i have last been on here and want to tell you guys that i am on the recovery...I am starting to feel like my old self again and i can tell you,you will beat this...I will be here to help anyone who needs some support...(((Huggs)))

hello....Ive been feeling depressed for a few days now....im just sick and tired of my illness...my medication is working and I don't know what's wrong....I'm just tired of it all.... 
Im 32 and suffer with depression and anxiety attacks iv never felt like this before and yet to get to see a GP about my problems. I live alone and lead a very boring work all the time life. My problems seem to block out everything i have and cloud my judgment. All i can see is no way out and with only one decision to make... "end it" Im so scared about going to sleep at night due to horrific nightmares that seem so real,  Is life meant to be like this, am i better off dead and letting the more successful, more important people live out a comfortable life.  Eveyone says "things can only get better" But in my mind my time on this planet has finished. 
Why am i so afraid to admit that i have depression,i have always just said its problems from my anxiety,i feel of people know they will treat me differently,i know deep down that i am depressed,i am on a new tablet now for my anxiety because i get seriously anxious thinking people will know about my depression becuase i an sure that some day i wont be able to get out of bed  and then everyone will know, will the new tablet lexapro help with depression too???� mental health sucks 
Lately, I have done a lot of research on the benefits of magnesium, reading material on various sites and watching podcasts from eminent medical researchers in the field. Some of what I learned in a nutshell are that after vitamin D, magnesium is the supplement that we are most lacking in. It is difficult to get enough magnesium in our normal diets! 95% of us are magnesium deficient. There are over a dozen reasons for this, one of which is soil depletion...by chemicals such as pesticides!!..  This deficiency in magnesium impacts many systems in the body, especially the brain. It is believed that ADHD is a result as well as depression and anxiety...and IBS...because there is a brain/bowel connection.  My own personal story is about my daughter, Valerie, our 3rd who was a messy, hyper, little wild thing as a child. She had ADHD for sure although never diagnosed. She had a hard time focussing and we got her tutoring. When she reached her mid teens, I happened to read about the benefits of magnesium on the brain, mood and on the ability to focus. I started giving it to her before tests and exams at school with incredible and dramatic results. She herself would come to me and tell me how much better she was able to study and focus and do well on her tests and exams. In that time period, she changed in a way I never thought possible. She became neat and organized (her room and her person and her thought processes). She became ultra focussed and suddenly started to do extremely well in school...and in university. I won't go on to brag about her successes in life but let's just say she has got it all together. And she, herself will state that it all started with magnesium supplementation.   I urge you to read up on this natural mineral, magnesium and its extraordinary benefits.  I take 2 tablets of magnesium citrate (or glycinate) every night before bed in order to  1. help me sleep better and 2. to keep regular in the morning. I am always in a good mood and at age 65, I do have an extraordinary zest for life...so maybe it has benefitted my brain in ways I never realized.  Like vitamin C, if you take in too much magnesium...which is highly unlikely, it is just excreted in the urine.  We are a nation/world with far too many cases of people with mental issues. And perhaps many of them are due to a simple magnesium deficiency. 
I always feel 10 times better at night, not back to normal but a lot more able to look at things more positively... Sometimes I stay up so late because I like feeling like this and I know that in the morning bam! The depression and anxiety hits me full force and most of my day is a struggle does anybody else feel at ease in the evening? Sometimes I naively think that this feeling is going to carry on to the next day and I start to make plans of things I'm going to do the next day only when the time comes I'm unable to do anything.

Hi all, I am new to this forum. Glad I found it. I have depression and anxiety and recently started on AD's which is helping alot. i would  say I am highly functionig as i manage a very busy department. A question for everyone who has a partner, do you find them supportive? My partner has never dealt with anxiety or depression and when i talk about it i dont think he truly undrstands, I am also a step parent to his 2 young boys, I often feel left out.. I am seeing a counsellor next week to talk things through. Any thoughts?   thanks Lis 
I was very recently prescribed Sertraline. I've not started taking it yet but I'm am just about to start a new job the day after tomorrow.   Having read the leaflet and consulted a few different threads etc... My question is, will I be able to start a new job and Sertraline at the same time? How will affect me? will it change how I interact with people? I Suffer a great deal of anxiety through my condition at the moment anyway? So will it have an adverse effect on me?

I'm going through menopause and just need advice.  I'm angry, stressed and do not like anyone but my kids.  It's very lonely when you hate the world. � 
I've never actually been to a blog, posting my problems but I feel like I need to get my thoughts out somewhere where people are willing to help, so here I am. I don't even know how to start, I'm lost, I feel like I can't find the real me, the me me. I've always had a problem with self-confidence, I've always had a problem regarding friends as Sush but today it just hit me, I'm not really me. I changed, I don't know how but I changed and it's scary. I don't feel like I'm the person I want to be. I  have problems speaking to other people like family and close friends I known my whole life, and I have never had a problem speaking with them before. The thing is tho, that I've had this problem for a while, but it's never been this strong before. Every time I wake up I think to myself: I don't have any problems". I do this because otherwise I just think about everything that happend before in life. You see, when I was in 9th grade, I had huge problems speaking with others! This eventually was leading to me getting, well ignored. Nobody talked to me, because I didn't have confidence to say anything. This have hurt me every sense, and I just try to forgetting about it and it's a truggle everytime I wake up to just forgetting about it. So yesterday I said no. I stopped avoiding the problem and just started to remember the horrible feelings again, and it didn't help. It made things worse, Im now in a state where I don't feel like myself, I can't get the memories out of my head! I dont know how to get rid of them everytime I see one of my old friends from my old class. I just don't know what to do, I need help! Can I ever get to be myself again?  
I've been depressed for 2 years , what should I do?   
Hi I was put on citalopram for a few months, within a month of stopping I started to gain weight within 6-8 weeks I was 2.5 dress sizes bigger and for 5yrs I exercised twice a day burned 2000 cals and ate under 1000 a day and couldn't shift the weight. The doctors did all sorts of tests and nothing came up. Thats when my normal happy life stopped i only went on them because i was ancious about a break up. I continued visiting the doctor with new research as to what it may be. Then 11 months ago something happened and I was prescribed citalopram again and within a few months I'd lost the weight I just assumed it was stress but I exercised less and ate more which was odd. Then 4months ago I came off the citalopram and got my energy back and started running again but started gaining weight and within 6/8 wks I was 2dress sizes bigger which is when I started researching citalopram I found American forums with many people in the same situation and someone called it paradoxical weight gain iv been in touch with lundbeck the makers of the drug but they so say have had no reports. This I find hard to believe there are so many people with the same reaction on the American sites. Also in the research iv done there are studies in animals that suggest the brain does not renormalise after coming off citalopram and they deny this could have anything to do with weight gain. How can it not? Your body needs serotonin and tryptophan receptors to burn fat, if this function does not renormalise  surely it can affect weight?? Does anyone have anything to help me?? I'm thinking of taking them to court as I am now depressed on diazipam having panic attacks all because I was a little anxious about a break up 6 yrs ago. Please help if you know anything x 
Hi  I started a relationship with my boyfriend in October, and things started to move very quickly. He was staying with me everyday and we decided that due to this it would be best to move in after Christmas .In the three or so weeks he has lived with me he has seemed very happy. As with any new living relationship there have been a few arguments but nothing untoward.  On Monday this week, he was extremely cuddly and was questioning why I was with him. We cuddled and I explained that I love him very much, we have so much fun when together and I didn't want to be without him. I asked if he was ok as he didn't look well and he said he was tired. On Tuesday he still wasn't right so I suggested taking the day off.   On Tuesday I received a text to say he has gone home to Ireland for a few days (we live in Scotland) since then I have had very little contact. I understand he went to his family where he felt safe. In the one phone call I've had he said that sitting in the house he felt like the walls were closing in around him and he had to get out. He has said that he never felt like this when single and he is at his lowest ebb, I deserve better (I said I didn't agree and he is everything I want)and he's doesn't think he's cut out for a relationship. At 35 I am his most serious relationship.   Since Wednesday I have had no contact although I have phoned and messaged him. His best friend has also had nothing despite calling and messaging.   I'm looking for advice. Should I leave him till he contacts me and hope he decides he wants to be. With me or accept that what he said is true and it's the relationship that's caused these feelings.  Thanks for any help 
I am genuinely perplexed by what's happened to me and I've been to countless unhelpful doctors. Last April, I had a panic attack, was placed on Klonopin; returned to my doctor to get off the benzo; rx'd Lexapro. I had an odd reaction to the Lexapro-as soon as I started it, I had uncontrollable fits of crying. I've never experienced anything like this before; taken off it then put back on by another doctor up to 40mg. Then, I was placed on prozac-still have the uncontrolled crying...I am so confused by this. Are these signs that ssri's are not right for me? Are these something that will pass? I'm fearful to try other meds because of this.... 
Ok guys this is how it is I was brought up in care and altho I dont believe your past makes you I do think it shapes you, ive had trust issues as long as I can remember I learnt fast the more ppl knew about you the mire they could hurt you, an explaination to why Ive lead my life in three different personas I guess I never intregregrated any of my lifes so I had a girlfriend I had socail friends and I had work ppl as friends all completly separate the problem with that is when one falls apart you cant talk to anyone about it because they know nothing about that side of you or your life so to my work colleagues I was the family manto my socail friends I was the clown nithing ever bothers and to my ex I was the fearless whom stip an armed robbery by foyr guys because id had a bad day and they threaten a female member of staff the teuth is im none of those things to me im the guy whom as no reflection in the mirror the guy whoes still a little boy trapped inside a mans body the guy who sees nothing but blankness behind his own eyes im dead inside my soul already claimed im exhausted im pathetic and im wanting to end my life ive tried anti depressants they turned me numb I went to the mental health team but after taking medincine that made me have audio and visual hallucinations I refusdd to take and so they discharged me I biught a tow rope today to do the dead once and for all it doesnt scare me I just am scared of what ppl will think abiut it when I act on it is there anything left for me to try?

Hi guys & girls,   I've been a member on the forums for a while now nearly a year and my problem still persists.   For 18 months now I have felt like I am drunk 24/7 and gets even worse around 4/5pm .  The best way to describe it is being spaced out, or like I am high on some sort of drug that numbs your brain. I have no mental clarity, don't know what day or time it is ever without looking at my phone, I always feel drunk & exhausted, my vision is not blurry, but I can't see if that makes sense. It's like my brain is blocking out what my eyes are seeing ?!   When I was younger I used to get this feeling for maybe an hour ? Then it would go, never knew what it was but it always went.... however now I am being stuck with it for 18 months and il be honest it's that bad I have contemplated wether to give up a few times ... you know what I mean.  I have seen about 20 doctors about it & specialists, they all refuse to give me a brain scan as I don't suffer from sickness or head pain. They say it's Anxiety/ depression .  I have tried Eaictalopram 15mg for 4 months and that did nothing, so I am now off it and will be trying  a new drug soon.   If it was Anxiety/ depression why is it constant ?! It's not on and off I mean I've felt spaced out for a whole 18 months, I find it hard to drive, I slur my speech, I absoloutly hate it.  I tried CBT where the man said he knew of people feeling spaced out but no as bad as me and no where near as long as I have.  I'm 21, UK. And to be honest I'm struggling so much now I wish I was not here. No medical professionals will help or even believe how bad it is, because I LOOK fine, but I'm just  not there ?! I can put an act on and talk and pretend I'm fine, but it's like my brain is dead ?   I walk around feeling detached from my body and thoughts, been told it's called Derealization, but again it's with me CONSTANTLY.   *Foggy Head *Drunk feeling *Zoned out / spaced out but I can act and look fine. *Brain dead *No concentration  *No drive at all  *Also suffer from chronic pain in my back and chest which started around the same time as this, doctors can not find anything wrong with me.  Guys I need help, the. NHS have given up on me and I can't keep going like this please someone advise me  
Hello. I have just joined this site.  I have been battling depression for most of my life, but have only been medicated since 2010- Citalopram. I have started to feel so much worse recently and wondered if maybe it isn't really the right medication for me anymore?  Have others here started off on Citalopram only to find they need something stronger? I have gone from 20mg to 40mg in the last couple of years. Is this a sign it just isn't good in the longterm?  I try so hard to be optimistic for my child's sake and partner's sake, but get to the point where this is draining and I feel like a fake. I can't keep up with the smiling face and cheery words. An act, basically.  Any advice would be VERY welcome!  I think i need to see my GP again, but feel so wretched I don't want to leave the house. I have become quite antisocial again lately.  Thank you in advance.  SeeksSolace.

I've battled depression for all my adult life. I've picked myself up and been knocked back down so many times but I've always kept going. I'm now really struggling to continue. I'm 38 years old and I don't remember a time when I really felt happy.  I always used the reason of the pain it would cause to my family but even that is losing sway. I go to sleep at night praying not to wake up. Nothing interests me anymore it all just seems so dull and pointless. I just can't find a reason to keep fighting anymore. Every day is just pain and misery and I'm desperate for it to stop. I constantly think of the different ways I could end it I'm now just trying to decide which one. 
Hi to make a v long story short I suffered woth depression around 6 years ago when I had a massive change to my life happen it took me over two years to get better with out medication from drs although they prescribed them I would not take with fear Id become addicted and kill myself, I don't bad things in my depression like turn to another man for support as my partner did not know how to help me and spent most of his hours at work then in the pub, this affair went on for around 5 months the man knew my whole situation and decided to blackmail me when I decided to end things but I was that depressed I couldn't care less and ended it and took the chance never heard from him again, I started to feel better two years later then a close family member killed them selves and through us all off , I was ovbiosley sad by this but had to support my mum more , then a year later my pet dies and I was mortified it put me right back into depression the only thing that kept me alive was the fact I was pregnant , I have spent the last 3 years plodding on and mostly happy with my child and me and my partner have managed to stay together ï¸ï¸he dosnt know anything but did ask once if I had cheated , we are kind of stable and happy but I feel so depressed again like something is brewing up I don't know if depression can do this or it's just guilt I don't like my self I feel every one would be better with out me I don't want ppl feeling sorry for me because I feel I have created my life's mess I just sometimes wish I didn't have to carry on living , but then I think of the child that needs me and the mum and close family who ï¸love me, I feel I constantley want ppl with me I moan when my partner is not in and I constantley txt him I don't know why insted of going out and having fun somedays I do go out but other ï¸Days I just ï¸ï¸carnt like today, worth mentioning - the other day I was out and I seen someone I knew along time ago she looked at me and warned me off, this person had ties with the man involved at the beginning (the affair) ï¸he always said he was single then I found out he wernt and called it all off but that woman wernt the gf it was a different girl who I didn't know , seems he has had two gfs then me for her to know anythink he's been saying stuff about me this was 7 years ago so why is it coming out now,?  I feel im going to tip over the edge with this one I want to go and confront them ï¸ï¸an tell them straight he's the lier but afraid what it may bring

I'm in college and sometimes I feel like I have no friends. Some days when I don't have class I''ll just sit in my room on the computer. I eat a lot of meals by myself. I do have friends. I am on a sports team and friends with a lot of people on the team, I am just not close with any of them really. I don't have a really close group of friends or a best friend. I never really have and I don't understand why. Does anyone else feel like this?  I don't get how to get close to someone. I feel like everybody has close friends already and it's hard to get close to anyone new. How do you even make a best friend? Or get in a squad? In general there are some people that I meet that I wouldn't want to be friends with, but even people I really hit it off with seem to already have close friends and I'm afraid to try and make plans with them too often because I feel like I am bothering them. It didn't bother me as much in high school because I would see my friends all day at school, but now I don't have classes with a lot of my friends and I'm afraid that they're too busy to make plans with me. Especially in the off season when I have more free time and don't see my team everyday. Sometimes I just feel so low and depressed, which makes it harder to leave my room. It just feels like I'm spiraling. 
Hi everyone,  So I have never been on a forum like this, but I thought it might help to see other people stories and share mine.  I am in my first year of college and I've kinds of been struggling with depression and anxiety and just not feeling happy. I play a sport so I have a good group of friends with them. I party with the team a lot and I am close with several people on the team. However, I still feel left out sometimes. There are 8 freshman and I'm really close with one of them. Then the other freshman are split into 2 groups of 3 that are close, but they also hang out together. So sometimes it is 6 of the freshman, but not me and my friend. I'll see them on snapchat or whatever hanging out and I just feel really down. On top of that my other friend on the soccer team has a lot of non athlete friends, so its not like we are hanging out all the time. there is this group of freshman on another sports team that I really like, but I'm not that close with them and I only hang out with them with my friend on the soccer team. So a lot of the time I feel like everyone has someone to hang out with or something to do and I'm just alone in my dorm. I have a room mate, but we aren't really friends. She has a boyfriend.  I think I struggle getting close to people because I'm always afraid I'm bothering them. I'm am never sure if I'm really wanted so I tend not to reach out to people to make plans. I just don't have a lot of self confidence, which is another problem. So if someone else make plans, I'll go along, I'm just not good at initiating them. I also over think things a lot. I'm just afraid that people don't really want to hang out with me.  Also in the beginning of the year I didn't really try to make friends outside my team, like with people in my dorm or classes. Now I feel like everyone has already made friends and there isn't as much opportunity to do so. Part of the reason is I struggled adjusting to college. I am a little introverted, so I do need some time alone, but even when I don't want to be alone, I have trouble finding people to hang out. When I am alone in my dorm I feel like I am missing out. I am close with one of the other freshman on the team, but I don't like hanging out with her when she's with her other two good friends on the team because I just feel left out.  I'm only in my first year of college, so I'm hoping things get better. But its really hard to meet new people and go out when I feel depressed all the time. I mean I do have a really good time when I'm at parties with my team or hanging out, but I feel like I don't have anyone to hang out with when I'm not in big groups so I get even more depressed.  I know this post is kind of all over the place, but I just have so much stuff in my head. 
Having suffered from mental illness for so long and a huge list of different meds ( Lithium, Nardil , Fluroxatine, Prozac, metazipine,Venlefaxine plus numerous others . Then we have the therapy , the group and one to one sessions, i still don't feel any good, at best I've learnt to disguise the way I feel . I just want to know why can't I be happy it's not asking for much , I'm not a bad person . 
I stopped taking Effexor Xr cold turkey 10 days ago.   The withdrawals were just as everyone else has stated in other discussions, terrible!  I could not eat anything until day 6. My appetite is  slowly coming back.   Some of my main concerns now are how tired I am!!  My lord I have never been so tired.  I do not want to leave the couch. The brain zaps are still here which are not as bad as before, they are more of a vertigo experience for me now. My emotions are on high alert. One minute I have this sudden urge to punch my husband (I never would)... The next minute I'm crying my eyes out. And then there is my memory.. One if the main reasons I wanted off this drug. I feel my memory is getting worse now.   Can anyone who has gone through this same experience give me an outlook on how long I can expect to experience these above listed things ?   I was on effexor xr 150mg for 1 year.  I need my energy back. I need me back. I'm feeling hopeless.  
After a seriously bad year in 2016, consisting of a nervous breakdown in January (I know the term isn't used now, but it is a better description than 'depressive episode' or 'possibly a personality disorder', or other such terms), I'm finally feeling a lot better and putting the year behind me. Although we are in January, which is supposed to be a bad month, I am feeling more optimistic as the days get slightly longer and Spring is not far away. The things which helped me the most were a close circle of friends who dragged me out for long walks, bike rides, card and board games, visiting friends with families and playing daft games with their kids (who don't have a care in the world and live for the moment), changing my lifestyle to a more healthy one (cutting out caffine and alchohol, which was a tough one, as most of my social life revolved around pubs and parties, I've had a work hard play hard attitude all my life). This forum has been a great help when I was in complete despair, and it helped me pull through. On a less positive note, I found the doctors very unhelpful, with comments such as 'you've got business problems, deal with them', or 'I'd swap with you' or 'you've been here 5 times and you need to move on'. I was put on various different meds, none really worked that well. Eventually I was referred to a specialist and put on a combination which took the edge off a bit, I'm still taking them now but tapering off, with an aim to be off them by Spring or early Summer. I'm still running my business, which was very difficult last year, and I've re-modelled it to run at a slower less stressful pace, and promised myself more holidays and breaks.  My main reason for posting is to say that things do get better given time (even though I didn't believe it when people told me). Best wishes to all, Rodders  p.s. does anyone know why the term 'nervous breakdown' has been abolished?, I for one think it should be recognised again, rather than generic depressive conditions which seem like a stab in the dark by a doc who has only spent a few minutes or a half hour appointment with a patient. 
I hope you are all doing ok, been attending new exercise classes this week,my whole body aches, making an effort at work, been for a good walk this afternoon now getting totally trashed WHY you ask cos I can.  Got yet another assessment next week to see if I am suitable to get on an anger management course, got angry when i received the letter out of the blue cos I didn't know  what it was about how stupid is that, my gp when seeing him said he doesn't think i;m depressed thinks it to do with personality disorder!!! How f""""" up is that?? All because I refused to take the medication prescribed as i don't think i need it. Is that why i keep going off the rails, being reckless, I was told if it hadn't been controlled during the period I was married i would of been suffering from all aspects of personality disorder can't remember all the proper words, do you think or I think now i;m on my own I;ve reverted back to how I was as that is what it feels like to me. Don't give a s*****, don't really care about my family, me, life, been very detatched from reality this week too. Even been good two alcohol free days, very up down up again, irrational then sensible i just need something,, don't know what. Fed up, p off.  Cheers everyone hope you all have a good evening. xx ps I;m sure I'll regret this evening tomorrow but that is another day I just hate life at present don't see the point, very calm and collected too......bit all overthe place really. Can you tell lol. 
Okay, I donât know if anyone will read this, but Iâll give it a shot. So, I am an 18 year old guy currently living somewhere in the middle east, Iâd rather not say which country. So basically, Iâm really lost in life and donât know what to do. Ever since I was a kid, Iâm used to depending on my own. Never really asked for help from anyone, not even parents or friends. But now, Iâm extremely depressed. I suffer from anxiety. Constantly overthinking. I certainly do not fit in here. Everyone is so worried about pride and religion here but I donât really care about any of that.And the people here are just pure garbage. You just canât walk in the street without getting insulted and having to get in a fight every time for no reason. I hate this place. But yet again, I feel like I donât fit anywhere, not even the States. I have no idea what to do now. No one thinks the way I think. And every time I state my opinion on something I get mocked. So I just stay quiet. And because of that people think Iâm weird. Iâve actually felt like this before (even worse), but I was able to turn it around (on my own) over the summer. But ever since school started, it went all bad again. Music is my only escape, but I feel like the music that meant so much to me once, is just pointless now and does not stir any type of emotion. Yeah, Iâm in desperate need of help.

I have been feeling really low/sad since Monday last week and I cut on Wednesday I feel no better. I'm just laying down on my bed crying. Today around 2pm I could not get out of bed I was so sad and I just sat there staring at the ceiling while tears flowing down my cheek.  I'm mentally exhausted of everything, I'm battling so many things; self-harm, depression, anxiety and my inner demons EVERYDAY.   Something happened that I'm really worried about, I cut my lower half of my leg and it was bleeding profusely, then I put a plaster on it, then I checked it this morning and it's gone white? Is this just the first layer of the skin being taken off? Is this normal? Or an infection? Please help !!   Thank you.  
I've been feeling pretty positive lately and I've learned quite alot about myself and my mental health on the road to recovery, so I thought I would share a few things in the hope that they might help someone else. I'm not trying to belittle anyone's depression and say these things will cure you, they may not help you as a person at all but I hope at least one person can get a little comfort from knowing these things have helped me and they might you.    First thing I want to say is....You are not a bad/terrible person, you are important, you are loved (by family/friends) and you are most certainly worth the fight!! So please never give up �  You are also not crazy, weird, abnormal or going mad in a sane world. There is a medical reason why you feel the way you do, you are not being oversensitive or overdramatic....You have an illness and should not be or feel judged or like any less of a person for this!! You have been too strong for too long and your body and mind just need some time and love to recover or you have a chemical imbalance in you brain and with the right anti depressants and some time and self care you will be on the road to recovery.   You are not alone and should never be afraid to tell someone how you feel, it's how u feel and you have no need to feel ashamed or apologize for that (there's nothing to apologize for).   Haha if that first part came across as bossy it wasn't meant to. It's said with care and compassion towards you and I just wanted you to know if you feel these things, don't beat yourself up about it because you are not to blame and you are not alone!!   Ok, onto what has helped me deal with depression over the years....   (1) The first thing and the most important for me and my personal experiences was to tell someone what was happening, even tho I didn't know what was....I just knew I was falling apart at the seams and couldn't cope any longer. I spoke to my family who actually at the time also had not alot of info about depression so it was hard at first with not alot of understanding there but they got me to talk to my doctor who referred me to a phycologist. I can hand on heart not recommend speaking to a phycologist highly enough!! It is uncomfortable and I don't trust easily so was very difficult for me to do at first but it is so worth doing if you fully commit to it and pour your heart out!! Just let it all out, all ur fears, anxiety, past experiences, sometimes I would say things that I didn't even know was bothering me until the phycologist dug a little deeper and emotional s would come out you have hidden for years!! I'm rambling now lol but I honestly would recommend this if you haven't seen one before. They work through everything with u and are there helping u , but I'm not going to lie....It's hard work at times if you're facing feelings you have never faced before, but it is so so worth the fight. After most appointments  (not the first few but the rest!!) I felt like a load had been lifted from my shoulders and i could walk a bit lighter. Someone understood everything I was saying, everything I was feeling and they actually KNEW how to help me!!   (2) Do what you have to do to get yourself through. If you have to lock urself in a room for 2 days not wanting to see anyone, do it but don't get used to long periods of isolation as it is bad for ur mental health (it's how I became agoraphobic....Which i have now beaten yaay me). If u have to eat chocolate to help, do it!! Just don't end up eating too much, moderation an all....A little of what u fancy does u good.  (3) try and find joy in what u used to. I'm not saying it will be easy, I had joy in nothing but eventually little by little things start to click back into place and u see a glimpse of the person u were before!! If u used to love having a pamper night (bath, face mask, doing ur nails or whatever) do it....U might only feel like the bath and sod the rest but you'll feel fresher and a bit more human again!!   (4) Have compassion for yourself and your situation �� be as kind and compassionate to yourself as you would a friend. What advice or things would you say to a close friend or family member in your situation? Give the same love and compassion to yourself because u are more than worth it!!  (5) instusive thoughts ruining your life?! Don't try to push them out your head, trying to not think of them will only make u think of them more!! They upset you and make u feel uncomfortable right? You are not a bad person for having these thoughts, at all!! No matter how bad they are, as long as u don't actually act on them you are not a bad person and the reason they upset u so much is because u are a good person and don't want the bad things to happen but feel guitly/ashamed/afriad of the thoughts. You feel like there's something wrong with u and nobody would understand or even look at u the same way if they knew the awful thoughts that popped into ur head!! Well like I was, ur wrong, drs and phycologists know about these thoughts. It's all part of the illness you have!! So please don't be ashamed or afraid of them. Face each and every ugly thought when they pop into ur mind, accept that they are ur illness talking and not ur true thoughts and u don't have to feel bad about them any more. The more u do that and keep doing that the better u will get at letting go �  (6) Routine, same bed time, lunch time etc. Don't do what I did and stay up till 8am because u can't sleep and then throw your whole sleeping pattern out of whack!! Don't drink caffine before bed or so housework or anything that will wake u up. Even if u don't feel like getting up, if waking up in the morning feels like the worst thing that could have happened to u....Get up and stay up.    I hope this helps someone and makes sense and doesn't just read as ramblings lol. Take care and remember you are more than worthy of the fight!! ��   
Hi,  I'm a 23 year old male. Ive just graduated with a master's degree but im still no where good/confident/interested in searching for a job.  So all my life, I've been afraid of people and I guess things actually got better at one point. However, for the past few months, ive been a recluse. I barely spoke to anyone and even now, I have no friends. .  I'd like to tell ppl about how I feel, but I know that they are gonna judge me. So.. Im not good at expressing myself. I'm also prepared to receive judgmental comments here as I know people on the internet can be mean. Being a grown man makes me feel even worse to talk about this sort of stuff.  Anyway after some time, I also realized that what I've been studying might not suit me as it requires lots of leadership and I'm like a soft and cowardly person. I wanted to do something else like learning how to code, but I'm afraid that it might be too late for me and also I kinda get so unmotivated now. Nothing interests me anymore.  It's like when im alone, I dunno who to do it for. I used to get so excited when I'm doing it for someone like trying to compete and learn something before that person learns it, so that I can show off. But not anymore as I have no more frens and motivations  Recently, I just keep telling myself that if I end my life, everything will be over.. I don't have to force myself to work and talk to ppl. That's the thing, I don't really like the drama around people. Living a life is one thing, but working and having to listen to ppl bitch about everything.. I feel like I'd rather die than to live that life..  I know that I'm a grown man now, but my mental age might only be around 13-16yo. I just wanna talk about stuff that I'm interested in like TV shows, video games and music but I know thats not gonna happen and hence dying is the only option.  I also forgot to mention that I'm a quiet person so my teenage life wasn't that fun, and it's like I'm trying to get it back. Anyway sorry for a long winded post.  
hi well for the past 2 weeks ive been really down and i dont know if its just temporary or if i should see a doctor. my friends have been noticing it too but there is not much they can help me with. My mum is a ver bussy woman with alot going on. i dont think that hearing that her daughter is down constantly would help. i dont feel sick but i feel wrong. its wierd. i dont know if this s all just hormonal and just a rough couple weeks or if i should tell mu mum and maybe see someone. 
I have been on 40mg of Citalapram for over ten years and decided to go cold turkey 2 weeks ago. I went to see my GP and said I didn't think I was getting any benefit from them so he gave me Mirtrazapine and omg 1 tablet and I was so ill in bed for 3 days dizzy and vomiting with terrible nausea so I thought right that's it I'm coming off everything. Week 1 was pretty good no side effects no 'real' withdrawals but my word today (day 13) I am rough.   Aching everywhere, tired, nausea is awful, a bit snappy but not emotional. Still can't cry although I did get a bit weepy listening to a song on day 10.   I feel like I have flu symptoms and my head is so fuzzy and I'm very lethargic and my appetite has nose dived which is no bad thing as I've gained over 4st since taking these tablets.  Been taking paracetamol for the aches but it only takes the very slight edge of it.   I am starting talking therapy next week and I am determined to free myself from any need for tablets.I was just wondering if anyone had any advice 
Hi all not posted for while...  This time a couple of years i was in a bad way, studying in a different city i ended up being admitted into a mental health hospital after trying to take my own life. I'd experienced anxiety and depression without help all through my teens and it all got too much.   Before this I was extremely sociable and had a large group of friends who I loved going out with. In the lead up to my hospital stay I cut myself off from everyone but my close friends. I ended up going back to uni and finishing my degree as well as working part time and things where going a lot better as I was always busy.   Now Ive moved back to my home city and dont have any friends here anymore. Ever since i became unwell Ive become a lot quiter and less outgoing, as well as my mood being a bit more 'flat'. Ive been offered a job but not starting for another month. Ive joined a gym and am trying to stay busy but its getting me down a lot that i dont have many friends here.   Im feeling very lonely and have forgotten how to put myself out there because my confidence has been knocked a lot and i feel like ive become really boring as i dont have as much energy as i used to. It used to come so naturally to me and now it feels so forced and the depression side of me constantly tells me Im a loser and im boring etc.   Im trying to stay positive til I start working because i know that will be a chance to meet people but all this time off/loneliness has knocked my mood right down to how I was feeling before I ended up in hospital and my nerves are through the roof.   Dont really know what I was looking for writing on here just feel like I need someone to talk to. Thanks for reading 
Trying to make a short story of a long one. I just lost my business of 21 years and my house. I just moved to WI "for better support from my mom vs. my dad" Well, it's not happening. All the focus has been on my half sister. My mom has not helped my with anything, except getting me here. Now I am more miserable than ever and it hurts even more to see all the focus and help going towards my sister. Not sure what I'm going to do   
I've had depression for almost seven years now, I have tried various antidepressants, counselling and workshops and lots of other things nothing seems to work for me I've lost almost all of my friends due to me having this consistent depression it makes me snappy and irritable I don't want to go anywhere it drove my now ex boyfriend away from me and 8 months down the line I still can't get over the break up I'm so lonely and I'm sick of disappointing the family that I do have by not being able to get up and go to work or spend time with them because I get tired and moody being around people so many times my family have had to see me in a really bad way smashing things up and screaming cutting myself. I'm tired of being a let down and not being able to make anyone proud, I see my family thinking I'm getting back on track when I start telling them future plans and then it all falls to pieces or I have a manic depressive episode I just don't know what to do anymore all I think about is how much better it would be to just not be here  
I have always had high morals i never liked fighting or stealing or violence. I used to play violent video games like call of duty and grand theft auto and i fantasize about being in a world of grand theft auto and rob cars rob banks or be a wanted crinimal or violently harm a fictional character. These fantasies never came into play just fictional fantasies. I was depressed these almost two years i had thoughts of living my life as a known crinimal and people insulting me. I had thoughts of dressing style of a video game character and i had thoughts of being aquited of a crime then everyone will hate me for it when i listened to music i played these in my mind not sure if i enjoyed i would say i did not enjoy it. I had thoughts of me using drugs and commit high level taboo crimes or with other people and me showing guilt and crying. I had thoughts of being another basketball player who unintentional crime with guilt and i thought or had thoughts or both that i did it to my friend it happened when listening to a piano theme song. My mind would feel guilty and emptiness and almost crying every time it played i dont think i enjoyed it at all.I had ocd in the past couple months and i read a crinimal case of a very dangerous predator and my ocd hit me hard. I had thoughts of my old friend being the same crinimal and now i feel guilty i dont know why my mind put him as the same image or crinimal as the dangerous  crinimal. I watched the show night of and i liked it. But now i feel guilty because there was a scene in the show and my mind played it out that i helped or made a distraction in the prison and friend would violently hurt the predator. I watched prison break this last month i liked the show when i saw the crinimals broke out i had hype for the show in my mind fanatasized about being the guy with the escape plan then it got worse and stressful. There was a scene where a guy got shot and he survived but ran. There was a very dangerous crinimal t bag who commited high level crime and another In the show.  I thought the crinimal t bag would be sentenced e for the worst. Mind thought i was a psychopath. Then i had thoughts or enjoying fighting the crinimal. Then i also had random thoughts i was the king of prison and harming dangerous inmates and yesterday feel guitly that i had thoughts of that couple of times and feel guilty or scared that i have urges to harm or be a repressed feelings or being a socialpath or psychopath. 
I'm not sure if this is even in the right category, I've never considered my self to be depress but I just don't really care to keep going any more. My life is pretty much boiled down to going to work, coming home and then killing time until I go back. I'm 24 with no close relationships or friends to speak of...I try to be social with people and generally have to interact as part of my job but I've never been able to really get close to people. I don't avoid hanging out with my co-workers and generally try to agree to whatever they invite me to, however rarely, even when I don't really want to. This isn't a "Help, I'm thinking of suicide!" post but I just don't even care to get out of bed anymore and figured posting something like couldn't hurt. 
Just seeking experiences of those on Fluoxetine. I know everyone has different reactions to meds, but this seems unreal. Daily, I feel spacey, floating and just off. Physically I'm okay, but mentally, I am stuck. I have no motivation, am super agitated-feelings of jumping out of my skin....just don't know how anyone survives this...This is the second ssri to do me this way....when will it end; will it end? Hang in there longer...I just don't know what to do. At this point, I hate all meds. I feel so unstable. I've already been to a clinic for help; stayed three weeks and got no better-genetic testing even...don't know how reliable those are....I'm just desperate. I can't do anything....anyone feel like a zombie with this at this far along stage? Sorry to post so often...I'm just so desperate... 
Day 9 of withdrawl from 100mg Sertraline - head rush (vertigo), difficulty forcusing on one task, sweating and tearfulness!   Coping by keeping busy with house work (ironing, washing)!   1) keeping occupied, busy, engaged, none avoidant 2) not sitting feeling and pondering! 3) symptoms are as to be expected and researched 4) tomorrow is another day and I might feel completely different! 5) There is only me myself and I, to rely on here to manage this! 6) Positive thinking, switching negative thoughts  As fast as GP's are to prescribe this medication, it never resolves life events and issues for those who have depression! Lifes obsticles are here to try and test, in the old days none of these medications existed! Onwards and upwards, bring it on!!!! 
We've been going out for over a year but he's suffered with depression for a long time before we met. At first he'd just have a really bad episode once a month or so but now they'e getting more and more frequent, he seems to have very few good days. It's so frustrating because when he's having a good day he's the most amazing, loving and caring person to be around. We have such an amazing connection I feel as if we could be together forever. But when he's having a bad day he can't be around anyone including me, we'll go weeks without seeing or talking to each other and its heartbreaking cause I just wish I could do something to help him.   Does anyone have any tips cause I've tried everything and nothing seems to work. He refuses to go to the docotor to get help cause he believes it won't work. I've researched all these organisations and websites that he could look at or get help from but he doesn't want anything to do with any of them and gets really angry at me when I bring it up.   When he's having a good day and is happy then i'm happy to but when's he down it makes me feel bad to. My entire emotional state is dependent on how he's feeling and its just so exhausting. I'm constantly afraid that I'm going to say or do something wrong and it will set him off, I never know one day to the next what kind of mood he'll be in. I'm the only who knows about his depression so I can't even share my feelings with anyone, everyone notices that something is wrong but I can't say anything. When he's happy I isolate everyone around me and spend all my time with him because I wanna make the most of it and cherish his good mood but then when he's not doing good I still isolate everyone around me because I then become miserable to.   I just don't know what to do, I love him so much but if he never gets help I don't think things will ever change.  
Hi, I don't come to this website often. In fact I don't come at all. I just have absolutely no body to speak to and this feeling is extremely overwhelming and it keeps bottling up inside me. I try not to cry when I write this but I tear up a bit. I have been going out with my girlfriend for over 3 years everything has been great we shared alot of great memories. I couldn't live without her. I am an absolute social disaster, I am extremely shy and awkward around people and she was my only friend- in fact she was my soulmate. We have argued for the past few months and we've both been very emotional but something broke nearly 2 weeks ago. On that day I have been an idiot towards her, I was abusive (not physically) and I upset her in general up to the point where she just stormed out and left me. Things got even worse on facebook after she said that we need to talk and she offered a break - I didn't agree we argued and alot of mean things were said in both ways. Fast forwards 4 days and we managed to kinda get back together but as usual I messed it up only about 8 hours later. Fast forward to today, I speak to her on facebook, I was very careful and nice to her offered to take her out for a meal and buy her a gift. She wasn't having it, she kept telling me to stop, kept telling me that she doesn't want to be together. I literally begged her, it was so low because she didn't give a flying **** about me but I was there like a do begging her to take me back. She didn't agree to anything when I asked her if she loves me she kept saying I don't know. About 10 minutes ago she replied again saying "I don't know I don't think so" it shattered my heart, made my body shake and I feel like I want to burst out crying. I have no friends like at all, nobody. Most people have that one person they can fall back on, well I don't. I can't sleep or eat I try to sleep for as long as I can so I can spend fewer hours at home, I never go out I have no one to go out with all I do is wander from Facebook to Youtube and I watch the hours pass by. I think about her all the time, she was the only person I cared about and now there is no us anymore. It's summer, I'm stuck at home with nothing to do no hobbies, nothing. Next year I will have to go back to school and I will be in most of her lessons. There is nothing I can do, this anxiety and depression is crippling me I can feel it coming back. I suffered from depression 3 years ago and she was the person who turned my life upside down and now she's gone and things will be the same again. I just wanted to get my feelings out, I know that I will be crying all of today, tomorrow and possibly the whole week I just can't move on. 
Hi all, I hope you are well. I've struggled badly with depression for the last 15 months, 6 of which I was absent from work due to it though I have been back since March and not missed a day.   For me, the root seems to be a relationship problem - I feel terrible guilt that I do not love my 'girlfriend' in the way I once did, I see it more as friendship now, but even then, I find it so hard to talk to her as I feel shame and guilt, as she has invested so much love and time in wanting to get me better. It took me about 4 months into the depression, though, to admit the problem, as I wanted it to be 'something else' and not my change of feelings to her.  I am struggling really badly with the guilt, but despite me being so honest with her now about things, she keeps saying spending time together and 'trying to work through it' will help. I'm at my wits end, I'm 38 and feel like this was my last chance for happiness. I just don't know what else to do. 
Haven't seen any forums on mg reduction of fluoxetine. I was moved down by 20mg from 60 to 40 mg. How long did it take anyone to adjust to the lower mg.? And do you began tracking the weeks from 2 weeks after when 50% of the medicine is out of the system? Or from the day that the reduction began? Any help would be appreciated.  
I'm not sure if I'm worse than I realise so bare with me, ever since I can remember I've be intensely anxious, school was a constant struggle, a battle in my mind in which one side was desperate to learn about the world around me and on the other a voice. The voice really started to get loud at 12 years old or so, at first it was just pure negative (you're hopeless, nobody likes you,kill you're self) I left school and literally that day walked into my bedroom and didn't come out for months. The uncontrollable thoughts in my mind ruled my life. I finally was convinced by family to get out and start looking for a job, the very notion of going for a job interview was on the terror level that I'd imaged coming face to face with a large predator. I felt so utterly hopeless. To bring a long story short the voices got quite as I assumed a stable life. Until 2 years ago when a member of my partners family threatened me over seemingly nothing, at first I was shaken by the whole thing, but that evening the voices started, I found them telling me he was a threat to me and my family and I should kill him before he kills us. This ran over and over in my head, but it got so intense I started thinking my colleges were out to get me and some of my closest friends and family became threats, "has somone poisoned my drink" was a popular touture in my mind, I told a doctor of my thoughts but he more or less shrugged it off. I have had several physical in counters with people over my paranoia in the years. I know I've gone on a bit but can anyone see from the short version of my strange behaviour if you recognise something. I'm now going through a downward spiral again, thank you for reading my shortened story any reply if welcome  
Over Three months ago I decided to stop taking my 100mg of sertaline the reason was a week before hand the doctor decided to put me onto ventflaxitine as well.. my tablets help with my anxiety but left me emotionless, tired ALL the time with absolutely no motivation and gaining weight rapidly. I know I should not have but I came off them right away halving my dose for a week then having none  from then on and for around 6 weeks I had nasty side effects such as head aches, rage, sickness and a cold which were to be expected with not gradually coming of them. But I'm stuck in this weird phase where I'm not happy one bit I literally cry at something that's not even remotely sad on the tv or if I read something I have absolutely zero motivation if I could lie in my pit all day I would . I'm wondering when I'm going to be even a little back to before I started them. Has anybody succeeded coming of them? When will I be me again? I've never felt this low and depressed in my life.  
I have been depressed for almost 2 years. I have no friends at all. I am completely alone, nobody wants to talk with me in high school and my teachers don't help me either (they rather keep their distence, because I am repellent and not talented enough so it's not worth caring about me). I obviously fell so bad, I cried almost every day in the school toilet, I just could't stop it though I knew that I had to be strong. The worst part is that I feel like my brain doesn't work. My memory is so bad, can't concentrate and solve problems. I literally did nothing in the summer holiday. I wasn't able to. I have read that certain parts of the brain like hippocampus shrink due to depression, but is it just because of depression? Because I feel like that my brain is so demaged that sometimes I can't even remember what happened the day before and I am completely unable to learn anything. I feel so miserable and hopeless. Please somebody help me I have no idea what to do. 
(Living in the U.K.) I hate to write this post, but I need advice.   After getting drunk and fighting with my mum, my stepdad told us he'd "taken at least 30 paracetamol." We rang an ambulance as he seemed to become disoriented and told them he'd taken approx 30, the operator said the usual "Don't leave him alone, make sure he doesn't try and throw up, if he gets worse call us straight back."  Anyways, we rang 999 using his phone, and a little while afterwards he snatched it back and barricaded himself in the bedroom.   During this time he used his phone to ring a friend, although the operator said not to ring anyone else using the phone. Will this mean they're unable to call us back? Also, if my stepdad rang 999 and said to cancel the ambulance and that he didn't need one, would they cancel it? I only ask as he's hinted that he has in fact done this.   We rang them at least an hour and a half ago, how long should it take for an ambulance to arrive?   Any help would be appreciated, sorry if this post doesn't make much sense I'm trying to type as fast as possible and post this question.  
Hi,  I'm struggling to write this as just this morning my boyfriend and I had a row which resulted in him saying he feels like our relationship could just be friends. However we are in a really happy relationship he says he's very happy with me and has previously told me he feels more compatible with me than his ex that e was engaged to! We've been together a year and a half but he has always been honest in saying that he doesn't feel he loves me. However he doesn't understand why because I have everything he would love about someone and we are completely compatible. About a year before we got together the mother of his son took him abroad and has never brought him back, he hasn't seen or contacted him for three years. I know he's depressed and he's told me he thinks he is so I feel his depression could be in the way of him feeling that love towards me as other feelings are there. He doesn't really want to use sex but again I feel this is the depression as it's a common issue. He is extremely affectionate though and we cuddle etc all the time. He is happy to see a counsellor but feels we are just friends, I think he's saying that due to the lack of intimacy but I am convinced that is the depression and if he could get help with therapy perhaps those love feelings would arise?  Any comments would be amazing!  
I'm struggling and have been for the past few months. I've not yet told my psychiatrist as every time I get an appointment, it always end up getting cancelled last minute.   I'm a 3rd year uni student prior to that I worked for 15 years.   I've have major depressive disorder and was hospitalised about 4 years ago.   I feel anxious, low self esteem and lack of confidence. I've no motivation and my house is upside down. I've not found the energy to do the housework. I'm exhausted I just want to sleep all the time.   At lectures I listen to everything that's been said and I enjoy it, but when I go away, I actually cannot remember what I've learnt. I don't know what's wrong with me.   This is the first time I've used a forum in 3 years and I feel this is the only place where I can off load as at the moment I really don't want to worry my family and friends.   Im already on venlafaxine 225mg, lithium 800mg and quetiapine 75mg  Trying my best but it's so hard.  
I have been taking Ven for almost 7 weeks now (first week on 37.5mg and almost full 6 weeks on 75mg once a day)   I have been doing great on them...up until yesterday! I woke up feeling anxious and flat; barely ate any lunch but managed most of my dinner. I didn't sleep much at all last night (my sleep has been great again up until last night) and woke this morning feeling anxious and had a dry, horrible mouth.  I don't feel quite as bad at the moment as I did this time yesterday, but I still feel a bit anxious.  My in-laws have been making a nuisance of themselves since the weekend and I think this might have stressed me out.  I don't know if it is just a blip or not. My next catch-up with my GP is actually tomorrow morning (Wed 18th) at 9am.... I don't know whether I might have to increase my dose to 150mg?  Any feedback/experience or advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you! X 
Hi. I'm 17 years old and I've had a depression before [and until now, I guess]. I tried to cut before but the blades aren't sharp enough to cut my skin. Last October, my classes began and I was doing well that time. Until one day, I've noticed that everyone's expecting a lot of things from me. It's like, they wanted me to be the best person in the world just to rub it on my aunt's face and I don't like it. Then I skipped my P.E. classes for no reason. Then this January, I saw my grades and I feel worse. I usually love to go to school, but now, I just... want to cry whenever I go there. I feel like a big failure because I don't and I can't make myself better. Last night, I cried because I can't even motivate myself to go back to track. I am trying my best not to be back in that depression hole again, but with the pressure and all, I think I'll be sucked by that hole again. I told my parents about what's on my mind but they just said I'm making up excuses because I am lazy and because I want their attention. They're always mad at me whenever I'm sulking. I don't think they will ever understand me.  Not really a question. I just want to release the negativity in my mind.  
I've been having a rough time the last couple months, felt myself slipping so spoke to my doc who prescribed Mirtazapine to take alongside my Fluoxetine.  Since starting the Mirtazapine I have noticed my appetite has increased severely & I really cannot afford to put any weight on when I'm meant to be losing it.  Anyone else have similar symptoms & how long do they last?    Thanks x 
I have no friends and no I'm not a loser. Anyone want to be my friend we can talk about anything  
I've never been so depressed in my life, I've got no friends or life I'm scared to go out recently because I of the way I look I think I'm ugly, Ive got bipolar and I don't won't to live my life being ill I really wish I was a normal person with a good job. I feel like I'm a loser and not worth knowing I've recently broke up with my partner he was aggressive to me for a long time but I kept going back to him because I don't have any friends and I uses to miss him every time we broke up over the 11years we was together, my mum is my best friend but her sister died 1year ago so she drinks every day now I feel like I've lost her I can not communicate with her when she's drunk. Anyone been in a similar situation as me that could maybe give me some advice I'd be grateful I'm a very private person and I don't like telling anyone how I feel it's probably why I feel so low. Thank you  
Lost my mum in oct, many awful family problems, money and health problems and now the end of a relationship. Life is just too hard .  
Hello  I just have a question I am hoping someone is able to answer because I honestly hate the way I am feeling right now.  I have always been a happy person, I am the biggest worry wart but I am a happy worry wart. In the past month and a half I have felt sick going to work, I couldn't get out of bed some days to go, I finally got up on a sick leave and will not be returning for a while well I sort out what to do but that isn't my major issue.  Since I start feeling this way I have started to doubt my relationship with my boyfriend. We have been together for 6 years and I have always loved him, he is my best friend and I always look forward to spending time with him. We bought a house two years ago and things have been good. 2016 was hard but I don't think it was easy for anyone.    But now I feel like I don't love him, like he will be better off without me, like I don't deserve him, that everything for the past 6 years has been a complete lie and I was never happy with him. I always saw our future together and now I can't see past this year. It breaks my heart and causing me to cry more often then I want too when I have these thoughts, he has been my rock and the one who encouraged me to get help and he is constantly worried about me, he works shift work so when he is on nights I am worse then when he is on days.  I can't imagine him not in my life and losing him would be my biggest regret in life but my head won't fully let me love him. Some moments I can and others are filled with doubt that I don't love him anymore and I don't want to be with him. I don't know where I would go or what I would do but I am just looking for answers.  He is my first serious boyfriend, I am 28 years old but I can't imagine that this is it for us, I mean 6 years I imagined our lives together and now since the depression nothing. What is going on with me? Are these feelings completely normal or is it something else? 
Hello, my name is Philip and I'm 21 years old. Over the past several years I've been having some really bad health issues. They are making my life utterly miserable and I don't think I can take it much longer.  I've been having a boatload of symptoms for a long time. I know they have to be related somehow but, despite my frequent docotr visits, I've had no luck with a diagnosis. The long list of symptoms:  -I've been majorly depressed for the past 6 years of my life and no amount of medications or changes in environment have seemed to help.  -The depression never comes without huge mood swings. Out of nowhere I'll have a sudden mood swing that will consume my whole self. I'll get violently angry, break things out of my control and then 5 minutes later be unbelievabley sad. -Overwhelming fatigue. I've spent entire days just laying in bed because I didn't have enough energy to even move. I've had to skip out on meetings with friends and family because I literally didn't think I could walk. -Hair loss. I started loosing huge amounts of hair at age 17. Medication helps but now it's getting really bad at age 21. The hair loss isn't normal though, it will come out in chunks and not just on top, I'm almost bald all over my head. I've also been getting really bad dandrif lately, giant chunks of skin falling off. -Head aches. I've had a non-stop headache for almost 3 weeks now. The doctor told me to try anti-inflammitory drugs but they didn't help. The pain is not bad but it's constant 24/7 and it's getting worse.  -Bowel problems. I've been feeling sick a lot randomly and have been having an excssive amount of painful bowel movements. Sometimes I can't even get food through my system before my body shits it out.   I've beeing trying for years to find out what's wrong with me. I've done extensive blood work for abnormal thyroid levels, they came back normal. I've tested for anemia, normal. I tested for several auto-immune diseases, normal. Vitamin deficiencies, normal. I went to a "functional medicine" doctor who recommended improvements in diet. I've been off all gluten and dairy products for month and have been eating a diet of only fruits, vegetables, and meat. Nothing! In fact, my symptoms have gotten worse! My mood swings are getting so strong that I don't know if I can control them much longer!    Please help! I see no hope for the future if I can't figure out what the hell is wrong with me! Whatever this is, it's ruining my life. 
Hey, I have been on sertraline for about 6 months, but only been taking 200mg for about 3 months. I ran out of tablets on Wednesday and cant get more until Tuesday. I feel awful, shaky, dizzy and totally out of it. It is like being drunk constantly, but not happy drunk it is a horrible feeling. I want to know if it is dangerous, because if it isn't I don't know if I will bother going back on them just to feel like this again if I want to come off them. I don't like having to rely on medication to be 'normal'. Has anyone else felt unsure wether to continue their meds or not? I feel like there isn't much point living if I am going to feel like this all the time. Without meds im a mess, emotions all over the place, and with meds im a zombie, and cut to feel pain, just so I can feel something. I have also recently found out from my boyfriend that he feels like I 'chip away' at him, which is not a nice thing to feel, and I don't know why I am bothering anymore. He also said he will leave me if I cut again. I just recently told him about the cutting and he flipped, which I understand but the way I have made him feel makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit that is just going to drag everyone else down with me if I carry on like this. He thinks im sick, as I replaced cutting with nipping myself til I bleed, hair pulling and head banging. I know how pathetic this all sounds and I am sorry but I really want to get some advise. Me and my partner have been together nearly 7 years. This depression and anxiety has only been going on a few years but this year it has went extreme and I don't think my bf can cope. I have no idea hat to do and any advice would be most appreciated. I don't think he understands or believes mental illness and thinks I make things worse for myself as I over think and overreact and always think the worst, but I have tried to explain I cant help this and as much as I would love to not give a shit I do, when he leaves the house, to me he is dead, and point blank that is what goes on in my head, regardless how much I tell myself im being stupid, I know its stupid but I cant help it and he thinks I choose to think this way and I must say it pisses me off sometimes. I know this must be extremely hard for him too but I dont know what to do to help him. He is not willing to come to any of my therapy sessions with me or google my illnesses (I also have OCD and 'suspected BPD'' ) and I don't know what to do. Sorry to ramble, like I said im a but off my rocker at the moment. Thanks 
I have lost my job, my mobility, my friends and my life. I have chronic back pain from modic changes and having my L4/L5 disk removed. I just exist. I don't live. I hate my life. I am a father of six. I can't play with my children or enjoy being a partner and Dad. I have lost all the joy of life and exist in misery. When will this torment end?  
hi  not been on for a while as things have not been to good for me. I am now under home treatment for the second time since i started with depression and they have put me on new medication which i cant find alot of info about and if im honest i have never heard of it before it is agomelatine and i am 25mg at night. i only started this on thursday and have had violent headaches to the point where i cant even bare to touch my head and have also had extreme nausea has anyone else been on this medication or know anything about this medication. I went to see my pyschologist yesterday also the first that i have been there since being under home treatment and was shocked that i was under them as she couldnt understand why or how i could need there help dont think shes been listen to to me then and she cant understand how the things that we have been working on are still a huge problem in my life and dosent want to spend that much more time on them am begining to think whats the point anymore. she also seem to think that when you start to panic when you go out because its got that bad that it easy to get over and you shouldnt need help with ooh how i wish i was that simple then i wouldnt be suffering with depression in the first place and to top it off because i am under home treatment she say that she does want to see me until i have been discharged from home treatment so it seems u get the extra help you need in one hand and they take it away in the other has anyone else experieneced this and what are other peoples experience of home treatment and there psychologist because i just dont know what to think anymore i feel more alone now than ever and nomatter what i do things just go from bad to worse sorry for keep rambling on but just needed to all this out 
is there someone on fluoxetine 5 mg and that is working instead of more ? as 10 mg is too much for me for the side effect, the psy lowered it but he feels like he does this just to answer my request......he does not think it can work..... 
I have been taking Ven for almost 7 weeks now (first week on 37.5mg and almost full 6 weeks on 75mg once a day)   I have been doing great on them...up until yesterday! I woke up feeling anxious and flat; barely ate any lunch but managed most of my dinner. I didn't sleep much at all last night (my sleep has been great again up until last night) and woke this morning feeling anxious and had a dry, horrible mouth.  I don't feel quite as bad at the moment as I did this time yesterday, but I still feel a bit anxious.  My in-laws have been making a nuisance of themselves since the weekend and I think this might have stressed me out.  I don't know if it is just a blip or not. My next catch-up with my GP is actually tomorrow morning (Wed 18th) at 9am.... I don't know whether I might have to increase my dose to 150mg?  Any feedback/experience or advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you! X 
Hi. I'm new to this forum. Does anyone out there have the same experience with depression? Because I honestly feel like the only person who feels like this and life feels hopeless. I was a happy, confident, positive person who enjoyed life. For the past 3 months, I've had severe clinical depression and anxiety. Life is hell. I am in hell. I feel suicidal every second of every day. It never stops. The feeling never leaves me. I have an intensely bad feeling in my head, like something is wrong with my brain. It came on suddenly. Every day is a living nightmare. I wake up with shaking legs, a pounding heart, butterflies, adrenaline rushes throughout my body and a feeling of "Oh no, how on earth am I going to get thought the day?" I hardly sleep. I hate going to sleep because I know how I'm going to feel when I wake up. It's torture. I sit at the edge of my bed and can't stop jigging my leg up and down. Every day is unbearable but I have to bear it because I can't commit suicide. I wonder what to do with my day. I've had days where I've stayed in bed and those are horrendous. Or I force myself to get up. Just having a bath is monumentally difficult. Getting dressed is horrible. Doing any housework is terrifying and so difficult. I make myself go out and see people. I don't know how I find the strength to do it but I do. I walk with my partner in the evening. But the feeling never leaves. Early on in the depression, I was able to 'click out'. I'd suddenly feel normal and the depression and anxiety would vanish and I'd be okay for the evening. This happened a few times. I thought I was making headway but then I had a shock. Since then I've been dreadful. I can't ever click out of it and it's with me 24/7, no matter what I do. I've tried diversions - reading, writing, art, talking to people, films, everything, but nothing helps. All the things I used to love, I no longer want to do. I've been on Citalopram for 4.5 weeks but it hasn't kicked in - if anything I feel worse. I've just started CBT - I'm working on my negative thoughts. I feel many times like my head is going to explode. My brain feels ill. If someone talks to me intently for any length of time, my head feels like it's on fire and I am losing my mind. I can't think properly. Perhaps it's the drugs. Who knows. I want my life back. I want me back. I don't know how to do it. How does anyone come back from this? Will I get better? Has anyone else experienced depression in the same way? I'm in hell. 
. I'm sitting watching TV all calm and then sitting staring as if in a dream at the pills I picked up today and tempted to go and drive somewhere and sit and take them I know they won't kill me but it would be nice just to go to sleep and maybe wake up feeling empty, numb with no thoughts or memories or having to make any decisions anymore.....It would be so easy, even a pick and mix of all the others I've got left over from stopping AD that would work. Heart is pounding now, everything seems so unreal it feels as if ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eyes can;t foccccus

Hi -- I'm in my late 60s and have been on antidepressants since I was 30 (stopped when I was pregnant, but otherwise almost continuously). Most recently was on 20mg citalopram for 3 years. It was never as good as my previous antidepressants -- imipramine and venlafaxine, but I had to stop those because of gastric side effects and raised liver enzymes. The citalopram seemed to stop working a couple of months ago -- was getting bad anxiety and my mood was low. After a middle-of-the-night panic attack (never happened to me before) and a mood crash, my GP switched me to 50mg sertraline, plus zopiclone to help me sleep and propanolol for anxiety. That was a month ago. A week later, a different doctor upped the sertraline to 100mg, and then he upped it to 150 a week and a half after that. He has also put me on 150mg pregabalin instead of the propanolol. I started getting palpitations after upping the sertraline, so after a few days, he said it would be ok to go back down to 100. That was 4 days ago. So I have been on sertraline at varying doses a total of 4 weeks, and I still feel horrible. The initial crippling anxiety, which I had never experienced with such intensity, has gone. But I have no appetite, can't sleep without zopiclone, and my mood is in a black hole. It has never taken so long for an antidepressant to kick in before, and I am thinking that the sertraline is totally ineffective (although every now and then I have an afternoon and evening when I feel a bit better). I'd really be grateful to hear from anyone else who has experienced anything similar -- when you switch antidepressants, how long do you give the new one before you decide it's not working? Thanks for your help! 
Hi,  I was hoping someone could advise me on a horrible situation.  My wife has suffered with an illness most of her life which she requires medication for, its an imune disease.  when i met my wife I was living alone with a mortgage and met her on a dating site.  We met up and found we were instantly attracted to each other.  Within 3 months she had moved in.  As time went by she always made comments about how she didn't like the house etc and wanted to eventually look for another one, fine..  We had 2 children, got married just after the second and life was great. Early in 2016 she started to change and didn't like what she saw in the mirror and started fitness classes which I supported her throughout.  At the end of the summer she found a house that she liked (she had always been looking) and I looked and agreed that we would buy it.  Also during this time she started to get friendly with a co worker and I hadn't realised but they had been messaging quite a lot, to the point where I actually saw a conversation implying that they liked each other, the conversation was also deleted by her.  I also found out she had not being taking her medication for quite a long time which will cause her body to pack up.  In Novemeber we moved into the new house but things quickly went bad, she was stressed, didn't like the house and after a night out with the coworkers i lost it a bit an acused her of liking this other guy which she denied.  I also made the mistake of calling her mother as i was so upset who in turn called my wife and basically they are hardly talking now which she blames on me but there were already problems between them.  After this point she told me she didn't love me anymore and is leaving with the children but she isn't right, she doesn't like herself, hides if not wearing clothes when i appear.  She is emtionless and says she is broken and worn down.  Is this a sign of depression or is there something else that is at work here?   Before we moved in we were happy (to a point) but she always told me shes loved me and would text or call daily.  Now all i get is an occasional call or text but with no emotion in them and is usually about the kids.  She keeps saying i need to accept the situation and that she doesnt love me anymore which I have no choice but to do so and let her move out but she will struggle financially and have no time for herself.  any advice?  thank you    
I take 225mg of effexor daily. 150 morning 75 night.  During the day I have a real low down feeling.  It comes and goes. A couple hot flashes.  It is really bad. I am 69 just had leg surgery two times. I am really depressed right now. Will it help to increase the effexor?

Hello all,  I'm writing here because I'm concerned about a close friend of mine who I've known for over 15 years. We're both 28 and male.  My friend has clinical depression and has had some difficult times in his life. He lost his father when he was 20 years old and suffered from eating disorders and self-harm during that time. He's a very sensitive soul and one of the kindest people I've known. I believe he has some co-dependency issues. He's always had girlfriends from the age of 14 without much time as a single person. He's always very unhappy when he's on his own and has struggled to end relationships even when the girl has treated him badly. He left school with good grades and has a university degree, but has never had a job in his life.  A few years ago he found himself a lovely sweet girlfriend, she was very attractive. We all (our friendship group) thought he did extremely well to get her and he agreed. He always expressed how lucky he was and that he was the happiest he'd ever been. She seemed to bring the best out of him - they even started their own little business together. His overall mood and motivation levels were the best they'd ever been. We were all so happy for him. He finally seemed sorted in life.  Last year, much to our surprise, he broke up with her. It seemed completely out of character for him and we heard she was devastated.  A couple of months later, he told us the truth. He 'came out' to us and is now dating another male. Surprised doesn't even begin to describe it. None of us ever suspected he was gay. We supported him and were proud of him for finding the courage to come out though.  As much as I would love to be happy for my friend, all I feel is great concern... Turns out his new partner is only 18 years old and still at college (and failing all his subjects). My friend doesn't get out of bed until 1pm and plays video games 12 hours a day with his new boyfriend. This has been going on for 6 months now and he doesn't seem to have any interest in finding himself a job. He's still living with his mother and I believe she'd be happy for her son to live with her forever as she's been a very lonely woman since her hubby passed away.   I'm really worried about him and don't want him to waste his life away. I've tried to talk to him about his potential future career and job search, but he gets over-sensitive and all it does is cause an argument. Is there anything I can do? I hope he comes to his senses soon, but I fear he won't. 
Hi fellows!  I don't know if this is the right forum or this kind of discussion or not but I got nowhere to say these things. I am 30 years old and I am an MBA but I have been very lazy in studies as well as finding a job. Now that I have spend almost half of my life I don't have carrier, savings. I don't have much friends, health wise very week. I have got broken up with the girl I loved More than my life. I have waisted all my time and now when I look back it looks like a nightmare and it scares me. I wanna change but I can't I am trapped and stuck. I wanted a batter life but I don't know what to do. I don't think I am in a position to start from the scratch. But I can't apply for a good job coz I don't have a relevant experience of my field HR. I always worked in call centers and I got no skills and knowledge of my field. I am confused that I can't take a right decision and I feel myself a looser. Please suggest me what can I do and how can I turn things around. I don't even know what should i do to settle myself like job or business. Where to start. Don't suggest to visit to a therapist please. 
Hi all,   I am 24 years old and wanted to share my past year and half with you..   I am naturally a bigger girl (size 12 and 5ft 11) and until the past year or so have lived my life being very confident in myself and my life. I've never really had many friends as I feel I am quite ahead of (as in maturer than) my generation so no girls have ever really liked or connected with me.. That never used to bother me and still doesn't.. Luckily I'm one of those who enjoys my own company and isn't ashamed to go for dinner on my own etc..   Around a year ago (probably due to my impulsive and obsessive personality) I woke up one day and decided I wanted to loose weight.. I think I was just bored and the whole thing happened by accident.. In any event in 3 months I went from 87kg to 69kg.. Worked out 2 hours a day on around 500cals a day and although I thought I'd feel amazing.. I felt like rubbish.. Everyday I was a robot.. Waking up.. Working out.. Going to work.. Going to the gym and th going to bed- I literally did nothing else! I also lost a lot of hair and my period so things weren't looking good..   Once I'd lost the weight I was planning on moving back from the city of London to my hometown up north back with my family (as although I had a fantastic job living in the city was becoming financially burdensome).   It was around then that the binging started.. I'm talking 3/4days long and 15-20000 calories a day... It was so bad that I would feel my heart thumping out of my chest.. I couldn't sit straight and on 3/4 occasions I was hospitalised because I tore the lining of my stomach. In any event I have put on 30kg in the past 9 months.. Around 20 in the past 4 months since I moved back home..   I don't eat because I'm hungry.. I only do it when there is a trigger which is usually an argument at home as I have a terrible relationship with my parents.. We all love one another but quite simply cannot spend more than 5 minutes together.. Their life decisions agitate me so much and then arguing with them and not taking for weeks on end depresses me even more.. That depression even sometimes turns into anger and ultimately leads to a binge..   I'd say the binging now has dropped to once every 5 days and at around 4/5000cals.. But that's still disgusting and I just want to stop..  I naturally have quite a sweet tooth and know that restrictive dieting won't help.. I want to solve the trigger rather than a temp diet that will only lead to another binge..   I have tried therapy for the depression and several anxiety and depression meds from my doctor but nothing at all makes me feel better   I hate my life and my lifestyle.. I have no Permenant friends.. I haven't had a boyfriend in 4 years as my ocd and anxiety really pushes me away from getting close to people and my day has no routine.. Other than work I do nothing but lay in bed or watch mindless tv..   I'm still young, a lawyer and thank the one above have a lot of great things in my life but I still just can't seem to find peace of happiness in my heart.. I'm constantly grumpy, agitated and I can feel people walking on egg shells around me.. I hate it    Hope this all makes sense and I appreciate I've rushed though so may be big event chunks missing   Thank you for reading and I hope you can help me find my way again   Wish you all the best x  
Hi, i'm suffering with Pure O and acute MDD for five weeks now. I was on lexapro 10mg since Jan '15 and it worked really, really well. Unfortunately some intrusive thoughts (harm ocd) started to creep in due to stressful times, so i panicked and my pdoc upped the dosage to 15mg. Well, i got a whole bunch of nasty side effects, after which he switched me to 25mg zoloft over night. Two days after i crashed so badly (suicidal ideation-like pure o), that i went to the hospital on my own. They put me on seroquel (slowly increasing it to 300mg) and escalated the dosage of zoloft to 200mg in only four weeks. And... i don't feel anything. No effects, no side effects whatever, it's almost like  swallowing a sugar pill. My mood is considerably low, i'm still anxious and feeling desperate and guilty.   Is there at least a slight chance that zoloft will start working any time soon? Or should i switch meds? Going back to good old lexapro is no option since it elevated my liver enzymes really badly and my blood pressure was through the roof while i was on lex. 
I can give everyone my story and offer advice to help but I know I need more than that to make someone see thatâs there more to life. Iâm speaking from experience.  I remember when I was in the state of severe depression no matter what anyone said to me, I felt that no one could understand what I was going through and the best option for me was to end my life. My self-esteem was at its lowest. I had severe acne, I was obese, and at the time I weigh 230. I felt ugly; on top of it all I was broke, I did have a few friends but I cut them out of my life because of my severe depression. And my family I didnât talk to any of them either. So with that I was alone. What brought me to tears was when I went to school, at the time I was in college. And people would give me this quick stare and gave me this face expression like I looked like a monster. And No Iâm not exaggerating and No Iâm not overthinking this. Iâm saying this because I never would judge anyone based on their looks and to be profile like this by everyone I saw, it just broke me down. So I decided to drop out of college and I tried to find a job. I can tell you right now I tried to find a job and was turned down more than 20 times. I felt so hopeless to the point where I started to cry myself to sleep. I resorted to drugs to help me with this depression, but it just made it worse, it just made me want to kill myself more. This went on for 3 years. I isolated myself for 3 years I stayed in my room and I didnât want to talk to anyone I hated everyone and everything. When my family tried to talk to me I would give them attitude and tell them to donât talk to me. I stopped going out, and pretty much didnât socialize with anyone for 3 years. Overtime I thought I was going crazy, I started talking to myself and I would stay up all night and sleep in during the day.  It was the 4th year when my life took a turn. I woke up one morning and decided to change my life. I donât want to live like this anymore. No one is going to save me but me. If no one loves me Iâm going to love myself. I asked myself why I am like this, truthfully asking myself this. I was never like this growing up, what changed. Thatâs when I started attacking all the things that made me unhappy.  I had severe acne and I was obese so I started working out and eating healthy. I worked on this for a year and a half and lost 50 pounds and cleared up my acne. I was still broke so I started watching motivational youtube videos and reading financial successful stories to motivate myself to make something happen. Since I isolated myself and didnât really have anyone to talk to for 3 years I didnât really know how to socialize anymore. I would slur all my words and mumble when I talk. So I decided to read books, I started reading out loud in my room and that helped me a lot. I still couldnât find a job and I didnât want to go back to college. So I searched online and found a pre apprenticeship that I can join to get into the construction trade. It wasnât just a job anymore it was a career. So I applied and got accepted and I pursued that. I finished the pre apprenticeship and became a carpenter. I'm making good money now. My goal is to save up enough money and start traveling. Those 3 years of my life I can't get back so I have to make every second count now.  So I can tell you guys things do get better only if you make it happen. You donât like your life change it. Write down all the things that are making you unhappy and find ways to attack it. Just donât give up. And I chose not to go to the doctor because they wouldnât understand what I was going through. Thatâs my story hope it will help everyone.

I've been there for 4 years by now , i tried to move somewhere else but useless (i don't know how it is in your country, but here you teach where they tell you) and i started to hate everything in life , i mean i had some trouble before and i have been always a little dark , but these last few years it took a turn for the worst ! i feel awful that i don't want to help those kids anymore , i feel awful that i'm not in control of my life , i feel awful that i can't be with my family , i want to quit my job and move on but i realize i invested so many years in this job and also i love doing it , and then i realize i don't even have any other skills and my education degree is basically useless anywhere else , i'm also dealing with a lot of stuff from my childhood , and thinking of my future ................ it's all so overwhelming ! i tried to take a step back and not think about it all at once , but it all sucks !!! my past is awful my present is awful and i really can't see a bright future . . . my family tells me to stick with it and it will get better , they said the same thing 4 years ago , sometimes i think they say that because they know i can't do better ....... i know i have to make a big decision for my life, but i'm just scared and confused . i was always the guy everyone wanted to be around , i was sarcastic and funny , i was full of life and love for everyone , and now i'm always explosive and angry at everything , i don't care about my family and friends anymore i picked up smoking , stopped working out , sometimes i fantasize about getting a terminal disease and just dying , and i just try to make myself feel nothing and its working i'm starting to feel nothing , last week i was thinking about my mom and how i would feel if she passed on and i just couldn't come up with anything , i always loved my mom and her dying was one of my biggest fears in life and now i just don't care . i really wish i could sleep and never wake up, i hate being alive 
Hi all,   i am 17 years old. towards the end of 2015 I was diagnosed with a anxiety disorder & depression, I've been seeing a counsellor since October. i was put on fluoxetine on the 2nd of July 2016 (for anxiety and depression) (update on august the 17th ) my dosage was boosted up to 40mg). I have severe anxiety attacks, which I can't even breathe, my chest gets really heavy.   Fluoxetine side effects that I have experienced: Body pain, Headaches, Tiredness, Anxiety is this normal?   I've tried to commit suicide four times. i am a self harmer my right forearm is covered in scars, and my left arm isn't so bad. I haven't cut in a week   I've been feeling better since September 2016. towards the end of november I had a major crash. (my mood had dipped) for about a month then i sliced up my arms towards the end of november.   i feel like my life is just crashes upon crashes. I'm mentally exhausted of everything. When will anything get better? I'm just so tired of everything please could someone help?   thank you.   
I have been on Fluoxetine for almost seven weeks now. I've heard that it takes awhile to make a difference but these feelings I feel can't be right. Daily, I'm unmotivated-hard to get up and do anything. I am spacey and somewhat disoriented. I never had these issues previous to the meds I've been prescribed to treat the anxiety which I believe led to depression. How do people survive these oppressive feelings? I am a single parent and it's so imperative I get back to being a mom, working and supporting my child but I am just so low. My mother is helping me, doing more than she should ever have to do at 78. I worry she will pass and I'll be stuck like this, unable to function. These feelings surely will go, won't they...this is taking forever....so sad and frustrated; demoralized and depressed. 
    If you have been living with depression, consider expressing yourself creatively through the arts to aid in your recovery. Don't consider yourself an artist? It doesn't matter. The actual act of art-making is enough to reap psychological benefits that can support an improved state of mental health and wellbeing. If one has personally partaken in creating art in the past, that individual would likely corroborate that statement.      Research also supports this notion. A study by Van Lith, Fenner & Schofield (2011) examining the effects of patients making art in a rehabilitation center indicates how art significantly contributes to cognitive and emotional healing. Based on lengthy interviews with participants, the studyâs results describes art making as a âtransformative activityâ leading to an enhanced sense of control over external circumstances, higher levels of self-esteem, and greater feelings of hope that they could overcome the illness. Moreover, patients engrossed in expressive activities achieved new outlooks on themselves and their lives, senses of strength from releasing thoughts that contributed to mental strains, and feelings of accomplishment upon completion of the process. For these participants, being surrounded by a supportive group and a helpful art facilitator was incredibly impactful. However, art-making is something that anybody can do at anytime on their own in their own homes while still experiencing positives mental health outcomes.   References:  VAN LITH, T., FENNER, P., & SCHOFIELD, M. (2011). The lived experience of art making as a companion to the mental health recovery process. Disability & Rehabilitation, 33(8), 652-660. 
I've read online in various articles and forums that i need to be telling my depressed boyfriend that I love him at least once a day. But how much is too much? I always tell him I love him on his way out to work and when I roll over to go to sleep after I've said good night. But how often should I be saying it too him before I sounds like I'm nagging or it starts to annoy him?  Thanks sarah x

I have been off mirt for five weeks. Only withdrawal is insomnia. I have done everything from acupuncture which I am still having, good sleep hygiene, health shakes, fish oils, magnesium, chamomile, warm milk. Does sleep ever return. Please help! Thank u 
I don't know what to do. I just can't do it anymore. It's been going for so so long and it's getting worse, I just want it to end. I want it to stop. I don't care how I just need it to stop. I am afraid to get diagnosed by a professional cause I am afraid of what they would say. Also, i can't really afford thrapy. I think I am going insane. My vision is getting worse, i can barely see with one eye, i am getting paranoid , i feel like me or someone close to me will die or something worse would happen to us. I feel like death is following us, i feel that if I look over my shoulder I will see it following me. I wasn't so paranoid before, it started a month ago. I think because a lot of people have been dying around me. My lover's mother died, a friend of mine died, my classmate died, my cousin had a hearth attack and died. My grandma is very old and sick and she keeps saying she'll die soon so she needs to get things done and over with. My mum is sick and is in the hospital. My father doesn't call anymore like he used to. He dissapeared from my life again. My little sister hates me cause I just can't play with her. I am so irritable. Everything annoys me. I can't control it. Getting out of bed is so hard it takes me so long to do it. I fee like I have no control over my body. I can't see myself having any future whatsoever. My brain is very fuzzy and my memory is messed up. I feel like I am running out of time. I want to go to medschool but I can barely make myself study. I can barely study for school. I can't focus on anything. Everything I do goes bad or isn't enough. Nothing pleases me anymore. It takes me so so long to study and i can't even be happy when i get a good grade. Money is really bad and my mum is sick so she spends a ton of money on doctors. I was also diagnosed with hypothyroidism and mum thinks my depression has something to do with that. But what about my paranoia, my feeling that someone will die? I am starting to become too afraid to get out of the house. I feel really scared and it drains me emotionally. I constantly feel like something bad will happen. And at night is the worst. I even have dreams with people or me dying. With funerals. I attempted suicide a while ago. I swallowed a fist of some pills but I got scared and made myself throw them up and drank a lot of milk. I am also trying to lose weight and i heard exercises help with depression. Mine don't. Nothing does. Nothing good ever happens that me. I don't really want to die cause there are things i wanna do and my family doesn't deserve that kind of pain. But i can't take it anymore. I just can't deal with the pain. I feel like it's paralyzing me. Help me please. I will try anything. Thank you.  
My Story,  I feel i cant bare this pain anymore, this guilt im feeling grows more every day. I fell in love with this girl(single mom) 19yrs old. I met her when her baby was 4 months old. She didnt want a relationship, ahe was so closed up for having suffered through pregnancy alone but i never gave up. I did everything until she trusted me. I took over all costs of raising our little girl, she'll be 2 yrs old this March 2nd. They became my everything. Until one day i destroyed everything we had, a stupid mistake i cant ever forgive myself. My mom was about to undergo surgery and i had no way to help them. So one day without thinking i stole from him money to help my parents. Thinking i would repay him that same week i took it and didnt tell him. I never thought abput the consequences i was so blind. Her brother got know the following day and through his bank i was caught. I know i messed up. That same day he posted my picture all over facebook saying what i had done, he took court action against me and i was locked up 7 days. I repaid him that same week when i was bailed out. Now everyone knew what i had done, i started receiving threats through f.b, insults everything. The girl i had loved ao much hated me. Ive lost all my friends, no one trusts me and i know even my family is ashamed of me. I moved away and im now living in another town, yet everywhere i go what i did follows me. The girl ive loved never wants to know abput me again, she hates me, and she says only God could forgive me. I destroyed everything we had built, our family all my dreams everything. I cant sleep, ive tried almost every night killing myself but i cant, im such a coward. I swear this pain is unbearable. I dont want to live, i dont deserve it, id rather be dead than living with all of this. I cry until i sleep i scream but no one cares to listen to a theif that had the courage to steal from her girl's family. I know how much pain ive caused her, and ill never be able to forgive myself for what i did. My little girl will grow and she'll never know how much they mean to me. Every memory every thought males me feel the worst person ever. Im so ashamed of myself, i dont deserve being here. And i dont know how much longer will i be able to wake up everyday with all the pain ive caused. Please i just need someone to listen to me.  Aniver 
Today I woke up. That was the beginning of it. How do we put up with this neverending contradicting crap. I don't want to be here yet my primal instinct tells me to survive. It drives me more insane every day. And there's time that I feel is stolen from me and I can never get it back. Its exhausting being angry all the time. 
Hi all.  I have now been on Setraline 50mg for 8 weeks for depression and anxiety. Initially I felt good, possibly because I eventually plucked up the courage to go speak to my GP or a placebo effect of taking tablets. However for the past 2/3 weeks I have felt that my mood is slipping back down to where it was before I started medication. My anxiety is no longer a problem, I am no constantly worried about the most ridiculous situations. For the first month I was able to control my emotions but now I feel like I am regularly tearful and low in mood for the majority of the day.  Has anyone else experienced a dip in their mood before it gets better? 
I don't know where to start really, I've been dealing with depression for almost a year now and I seem to be getting so much worse that I'm seeking some advice through this. I moved country over a year ago away from my friends and family and at first I thought I was just homesick but when I couldn't make friends and felt like I was being left alone all the time I realised it wasn't that. I'm a stay at home mum with 2 kids and practically no help. My partner is either working away or when he's not he doesn't even acknowledge my presence or the kids or very rarely. We fight all the time and usually that's not me but I've never felt so alone in my life. I've no one to talk to, sometimes I can go weeks without an adult conversation. I do try exercise, walks and even baby groups and after school clubs but i just feel worse pretending that I'm ok when all I want to do is break down and give up. Nothing is worse people telling me I need to get out there and get out the house!! I think in the last year I've maybe had 1 day of free time myself and maybe 3 nights with my partner which doesn't help things. I'm just in the house n feel like a slave sometimes. I really don't know where to go from here as I feel I'm so stuck. Any advice is welcome as I'm all out. Thanks  
I had a great life, an amazing boyfriend who loves me and who I loved with all my heart, a job I was happy at and now I just feel nothing.   I've been on Trintellix  (10mg) for 3 weeks now and I just can't find happiness. I have a man who is willing to do anything to help me & has been there for all of this so far and yet I feel nothing. Just empty and I just doubt our relationship all the time.   Is this what depression feels like all the time? I just hate it. I want to feel happy and in love again 
hi all new here i'm a 30 year old married man , in full time demanding work which i love and have a beautiful 3 year old daughter,  however i think i've had depression for two years now , i was prescribed sertraline some time ago but never took it, i still have the tabets and think about taking it all the time as my symtoms arnt improving, i'm just too scared of side effects and worried i'll be become addicted to it, i fear that if i start taking it and start feeling better i'll think i my head "ah sod it i'm fine' stop taking it and then have some kind of mental breakdown.  my symtoms at the moment include sudden feelings of panic and an intense fear of death i feel like i'm trapped in my body and powerless to find a place of safety.  i have a great fear of illnesses and a deep loving feeling for my family which comes with a horrible sence that i will one day lose them. I have horrible introusive thoughts and spend 90% of the day reasuring myself in my head that i'm not ill or dying, this leaves me with a low mood most days which is worse on dark cloudy days that it is on sunny days.   i struggle looking people in the eye and find it impossible to hold a conversation without stuttering my words, blushing and looking away. i just come across as rude but in my head i just want to be friends with everyone but cant.    i cope my keeping constanlty busy as this deters my mind, but t dosent make the feelings go away, i also workout alot which helps at the time but as soon as i stop it returns , i struggle sleeping at night and cant sit still or concertate on tv.  i'm found this site by googling stuff, can anyone here relate to what i'm going through and if so would you recomend sertraline  thank you 
I've been on duloxetine for about 18 months now (I think, my memory's awful) and have always had disturbed dreams and nightmares while I've been on it. Originally I was taking zolpidem 10mg and Quetiapine 100mg at night but I've taken myself off of those over the last few months. The nightmares have gotten worse though, they're incredibly realistic. Last night I dreamt that I was drinking and I woke up heaving and with an intense headache like I was hungover. Then I managed to go back to sleep and after dreaming that I was back at my parents house and arguing with them, I woke up in such a state and my anxiety was so high I couldn't even move, I was struggling to breathe and scared because I was struggling to diferentiate between what was real and what was a dream. I never wake up feeling rested and am constantly tired and yawning throughout the day, I've also been suffering more with headaches. Has anyone else on duloxetine had issues with sleep and dreams and is there anything that helps? 
Hello   I've been on fluoxetine since last summer, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me with some side effects that I am experiencing?   Severe pain around my body  Frequent headaches  Feeling tired  Anxiety  Insomnia?   Is this normal?   Thanks  
Hi I posted the other day regarding my boyfriend who, I think, has depression. Things have got worse in our relationship. It's putting a detrimental inpact on my emotional health.   I feel so unloved, so helpless and just generally rubbish about everything. My boyfriend is so adimant that he won't go to the docs for help. I booked him an appointment for this evening without him knowing. I'm going to try and take him to it when he finishes work. If he doesn't go to this app I really don't know what is going to be the outcome between us. I feel like I can't take anymore of it. Although I want to be supportive and not split up, I feel like this is going to happen!   Please could someone shed some light on it al for me please?   Sarah x 
I've tried loads of different medications over the years but none seem to work, counseling has had no impact as well, I'm so desperate I don't know how much longer I can take it.   Someone suggested to me to try alternative therapies for depression, I googled it and stuff like aromatherapy, meditation, hypnosis, and self-help books came up quite frequently. Has anyone tried any of these and had any luck?? Or are there other alternatives that help, I would really appreciate anything anyone has to offer.   
I have autism & suffer from severe depression, anxiety, sleep difficulties, substance abuse & suspected borderline personal disorder. I have suffered with these for 5 years now, that may not seem so long but that being said I'm only 17. I've been on every antidepressant that can be legally prescribed in the UK, as well as multiple sleep medications & an antipsychotic. Non of these seem to have helped me very much. I've tried CBT, DBT and family therapy and they haven't helped me either. I haven't been in education properly since I was 13. Things seem to get progressively worse everyday, and I feel as though I have tried literally everything, but nothing seems to work. I've struggled with self harm for years and had multiple suicide attempts. I'm at a point in my life now where I ask myself is it even worth it? That nothing makes me feel better, and everyday is just a battle that I don't even want to fight anymore. I know this must be morbid, but does anyone think that maybe some people just aren't meant to get better? That life isn't meant for everybody?

Hi Everyone, new to the boards. I have been on Fluoxetine for 12 years, dose varying between 20mg and 60mg depending on mood etc. ave just been switched from this to Escitalopram 20mg because my GP thinks my body is just too used to the Fluoxetine. Just wondering how best to change over, shall I just stop Fluoxetine and start Escitalpram the next day?? thanks 
Hi everyone glad I found this forum feel like I'm going crazy just need it to stop. Looking back on my life it's become apparent I have been dealing with this all my life well adult life anyway. Only started getting help with it since oct last year. After the head was stuck in a constant loop about my wife having an affair and since then I just can't shake the thought even though I have no reason to believe she is. Along side that I had a constant very low feeling about me never wanted to do anything which has caused my business to suffer and the lack of sleep just made things worse. Back in oct my doc put me on mirtazapine 10mg for the 1st week 20mg for second week and so on to 45mg. After about 5 days I felt in a better mood like I could carry on maybe it's because in the lower dose these help with sleep.but towards November time I started to feel lower than before plus I kept having burst of anger over the smallest thing. I started a course of cbt but found this this just to annoy me and feel like is was wasting my time rather than helping. As this has not improved I fact got worse I have become very controlling and very little trust for my wife, I've been accusing her of also sorts it's tearing us apart. I went back to the docs about 5 days ago now and was put on citelopram, since I stared this my anxiety has been awful from the moment I woke til going to sleep . Before when my wife got back from work I felt better and more relaxed but on this even when she's home I have feel of dread. I have no appetite what so ever either and at the moment don't feel any better � 
I'm 18 and I went through a bad patch this year with my parents. I went through the "boys faze" or the "teenage girls faze", and had my first boyfriend a few months ago. My family hated him and got me to leave him and focus on school. It was the best thing as I didn't love him. But they took my phone away and my social accounts. I can't talk to friends or do anything this is making me cry constantly when I'm alone. I hate not having trust for so long and having no contact with people other than at school and family. I feel alone and ignored which gets to me alot and because of this my mum thinks I'm being deceitful when I'm crying. I just want to have a social life like both my eldest brothers have even though one is two years younger than me. Please can I get some advice on this as it is getting to me a lot. 
I am new to patient, and was recommended by a doctor.  I sadly lost my dad in July and was feeling very low. I seen my GP who advised me of this site and also councilling available but am unsure on weather to go and thought I would try this first.  My dad went through a lot and I seen him deteriate with a very serious illness to get better to then get worse. So as a family we all struggled. Seeing the change of such a happy and positive man then become so weak he depended on us felt very sad, and the changes he went through during treatment made us all fear for the worst.  Since the death of my dad I experience a lot of nightmares, these are a range from dreams with blood, scaring or feeling I have a guilty conscience.  I didn't know weather this could be down to stress. I feel like it all stemmed from 4 years ago when my dad was first taken ill, this is because I felt low then too.  Not only that I was going through exams and difficulties with an ex boyfriend. That relationship was toxic for me.  A lot happened and I often got called names which now inputs into my mind that I'm not good enough or don't feel smart.  The relationship wasn't healthy for me and now since I feel anytime I feel happy I get down about how others may think of me.  I've recently started seeing someone who I've known since reception. His a lovely person but as we have been friends all these years them question weather the feelings on his side will last or if he will feel it's to much to be more than friends.  I'm always worrying and feeling I may be not good enough and feel that I wouldn't want to get to attached or into it as I feel like if something bad was to happen, on top of everything else it would make me feel low again.  I experience it on and off and I do just want to let myself be happy.  I've recently got a job within a care home and really enjoy my job, so have applied within full time for support work which I really hope goes well.  I really just wanted to talk to someone who could relate to the dreams,feelings, or worries that I have. And also I feel free to discuss anything that anyone has to ask me. If I can relate I will talk, I understand how people feel and actually find talking helps me. However most of my friends avoid topic incase of upsetting me, which it won't.  Thankyou for taking time to read.

Hi. I'm completely new to this site but I'm at my wits' end with citalopram and wondered if anyone could help please? Due to a family death and then a serious health scare myself (I'm fine) my anxiety and aging and death has massively kicked in and I've been told I'm having a mental breakdown. I was put on 50mg Sertraline for 5 days then taken off and 5 days later put on 20mg citalopram. After about 10 days I started to pick up but then had a traumatic session with my counsellor and dipped severely so was immediately put up to 30mg. That was 2 weeks ago and I was in such a state yesterday I had to go to the out of hours doctor. She has said I should be on  40mg and has also given me 40mg daily propranolol. I've been advised to stop the counselling as it's too traumatic at the moment. Does anone have any advice please? Can the dose of citalopram be too high? I just cry all the time and  can't function. I have 3 young children and I need to beat this. Thank you so much in advance for reading this. Please help me. Xxx 
Im 24 and had it all a lovely job and good friends but in 2015 decided I wanted to better myself and go to university so I left my job I some what enjoyed (wasn't really what I wanted to do)  I started uni and 2 months my grandad died, he lived with me and my parents forever so it really hit me, it was like loosing another dad he brought us up just as much. I found university really hard after, I'm the most academic person at the best of times and nothing comes easy but after this I lost all motivation and happiness in anything. I finish university after failing the first year so disheartened and depressed that I looked for jobs in the same sector as before, I got a job but left after 2 months after coming home crying every night I found it to stressful I just can't cope. I have found work again doing what I was previously doing on less pay but I'm not happy I feel overwhelmed with sadness and anxiety.  I can't stop crying I feel utterly useless and a disappointment to everyone, I can't shake the regret of leaving my previous job which I was content but knew it wasn't what I wanted to do forever. I feel completely alone in my thoughts and just give up on life. What is wrong with me?  
I've been depressed (diagnosed) for 2 years now. I've recently had my dosage increased to 200mg after a split with my partner. I work full time and study too in my spare time, although I haven't been doing much studying lately due to how I've been feeling.  I feel so low and can't shake it off. I struggle getting out of the house, even struggle leaving my bedroom. I don't talk to friends about my problems, just my parents. I can't seem to find any sort of motivation I need in order to finish my studies and carry on with life. I just constantly want a cry and a cuddle to my mum but I feel even she's starting to get fed up of my whining.  All I want is some success and to be able to move on with life. I'm only 21 and shouldn't be feeling this way. I feel so lonely.  
So I'm here looking to maybe talk and try and open up to the people who are my 'same'  Depression and anxiety have taken a strong hold on to me and it does not want go. It's made itself quite comfortable. I'm too exhausted to fight it away for there it is. Infesting every part of my like. Every aspects of my personality silently growing stronger. I don't want to make depression and anxiety who I am. But there's little I recognise of myself anymore.   
Hi. Me and my boyfriend have been together for nearly 6 years. In April 2014 we bought our first house together. A big old farmhouse that needs doing up. He's a joiner so he's doing most of the work himself. Nearly 2 years down the line, were still living in a static caravan with4 dogs! The house is still about a year away from being ready too �!  So my boyfriend has, I think, always suffered with depression for a long time but has always snapped himswlf out of it. A few days before Christmas 2015 he told me that he wasn't happy with me. We had a huge disscussion (me crying for all of it) and he just wasn't happy with how we'd got into a rut in our relationship sitting in the caravan most nights and watching TV. We said we'd change it and start doing more together. Christmas and new year was good. Then he got flu so we started staying in again.   Last night he told me that on the way back from picking a takeaway up he started crying because he could tell he was pushing me away. He wasn't sure if he loved me anymore as he doesn't get excited about me/our relationship or anything. He says he's not excited about getting in the house or anything. I can't imagine how he's feeling as I have never suffered from depression and I KNOW I love him. I've asked him to go get some help and he did say he would but then in the next breath said "let me get over this flu first then I'll go" I don't want him to get over the flu then him make another excuse!   I really don't know what else I can do. This is heart breaking for me as his partner. If anyone can tell me any words of wisdom I would be extremely greatful.   Thank you  
HI there,   I would lie to know if anyone has tried the new drug Voitioxetine (trade names Trintellix, Brintellix)  Iâve suffered with depression/anxiety since my mid 20âs â I am now 39.  I think that was brought on by undiagnosed/underlying  DD and recreational drug abuse.  I suffer with excruciating low self-esteem/worth etc. hate myself etc.  In the past Iâve been on Citalopram (pooped out after about 6 years on it) tried Sertraline (made me worst) Iâve been on venlafaxine for around 5 years. Its now stopped working.   Since August of last year, Iâve felt myself dropping into very bad depression.  I tried the natural route, eating healthy and exercising but it got worst. I then upped my venlafaxine to 225mg (which I have been on before) but got really bad anxiety and I think I may have even got serotonin syndrome â it felt like I was having a break down.   I am now worried I have treatment resistant depression.   The venlafaxine obviously are not working for me.  There is no way that I am going to try Mertazipine as the weight gain is out of the question.  Iâd be really interested/keen to find out whether anyone has had any experience (good or bad) on Voitoixetine.    I have an appointment with my local mental health team in a few weeks to discuss my options.  Fingers crossed I get to see someone who knows their stuff!  Thanks so much       
All the very best for 2017  BOB 
A lot of us have been on some type of medication and have weened off them at some point.  I'm currently weening off Mirtazapine I've had some stomach issues and nauseous feeling sometimes along with a lot of head pressure so my appetite has been affected. I know this is a common issue when coming down on meds and has probably happened to many people.  My question is what do people eat or do to keep there appetite during these times that may help make it a little easier on themselves during these withdrawal periods? 
I may shuffle off this world soon enough.  But this year has been, by far, the worst of my life.  I am not seeing a doctor because I know why I'm this depressed.  I'm not experiencing depression for unknown reasons.  First my Father, who was very dear to me, was diagnosed with bone cancer, had surgery, then had a severe stroke after surgery causing him to languish for 3 months before passing away.  Watching him go through that has traumatized me deeply.  I live 2 hours away from my parents, so I had to effectively shut down my home business for 3 months to care for my Dad.  My Mom is alive but has her own health issues, so I was taking care of both of them.  Meanwhile, my husband's business started doing terribly.  Sales down sharply over the last 2 years.  Just 3 1/2 years ago we were on top of the world and purchased a beautiful old home (or dream home) and had put a lot in savings in the bank for the upkeep.  But we were lied to by the previous owners and their agent and we discovered the previous owners painted over LOTS of rotten wood to make it look new.  They painted an old hot water heater and the central heat/air unit to make it look new.  All of these things, and many more issues they hid from us. Repairing these issues depleted our savings within 2 years.  Yes, we did hire an inspector  when we bought the house but they somehow MISSED all of this.  It's a small town and we're pretty sure he knew the previous homeowners and lied on his report.  We have no proof of this, but we can't imagine how he could have missed SO much disrepair (that was purpsefully hidden).  I live in the U.S. and because of falling sales, we had to drop our health insurance.  Several months ago, I noticed a lump in the same area where I had cancer when I was 16.  Luckily, the doctor that treated me then is still in practice.  He can't 100% confirm cancer without the tests (which we can't afford) but he is fairly certain the cancer has come back.  And I can't get treatment for it.  Then today we find out we have no choice but to file bankruptcy and will be unable to keep our home.  My body is falling apart, my life is falling apart, my kids are grown and I know they would miss me but I can't take any of this anymore.  I don't see the point in it.  Now my husband and I must try and find jobs but we are older now and have been out of the job market for years.  Finding a decent job is going to be all but impossible.  I have a good life insurance policy and am worth more dead than alive.  Just can't do this anymore.  I don't expect anyone here to help me or feel sorry for me but I do appreciate you listening to (or reading) my whining.  Just had to get it out. Write it down.  Maybe then some strength will come from somewhere to help me deal with all of this. But the hopelessness is crushing.  It's easier to type this here than talk to my friends who really don't want to hear about it.  Thank you for your time.   
It's 2.30pm I'm still in bed, no energy or enthusiasm to get up, have chatted to my sister well she did most of the talking as I couldn't be that bothered. Dreadful thoughts going through my head, planning what to sort get rid of to make other people life better. Put on the face so people think everything is fine. Then just go when I'm ready. That sick sinking feeling is so strong I'm just a pathetic excuse of a human being. Just can't see any point at all today. Hope you all are having a better day..  
Here's my story..  Me and my partner had been together a year was really happy, he had a son with somebody else when we met, he was very young still a baby but my partner was having a lot of trouble gaining access as his ex partner wouldn't allow him to see his boy there was a lot going on with it, I stuck by him and supported him..  Middle of January  2016 I found out I was pregenant it was a big shock as I was on the pill, I was around 4 weeks, I just cried because I was so shocked and wasn't sure what to do, we spoke a lot about what we should do, he straight away said don't worry we can sort this, I went to the doctors to book an abortion it seemed the right thing to do, he was having trouble seeing his son now, we didn't live together didn't have much money, so I booked the appointment I got told I had to wait another 2 weeks before I could have the surgical opperation so by the time the day came I was 9weeks pregnant, I had to go to the doctors to have a scan see how far I was and everything, my partner came with me, I went in the room on my own I wanted Him to come in with me but he didn't I layer there and saw my baby on the screen a time little baby growing, the day came to my abortion he came with me and stuck by my side...I now would of had a 3 month old baby and it kills me everyday to think I got rid of it, I regret it so much and I still cry to this day, I find it so hard because he has a little boy already who is now 2, so when I see them bonding together I get so upset because that's all I want, I don't feel I'm ever going to be happy and back to myself again untill I have a child, end of January will be my year mark since I had my abortion, I get days where I have so much anger in me and hate in myself for what I did I just take it out on him, it's not helping our relationship but I feel he doesn't care, he never gets upset about it, he never talks about it, if I'm upset he always asks what's the matter but I feel if he felt how I felt about it he wouldn't need to ask he would know that's what I'm thinking about, I feel that because he has a child already our one didn't matter because it wasnt born or I wasn't very far gone... I still feel like I'm pregnant all the time and find myself doing pregnancy tests more then ever, I dunno if that's because I'm hoping I will be.   I want more then anything to have a baby and I want him too aswell I'm sick of having so much hate and anger in me for a decision I wish I never made.. not really sure why I wrote on here really I guess I just needed someone to talk to who I don't know, I want him to feel how I feel the loss I feel I'm full of so much anger and sadness, I love him so much and I want to be with him forever but I feel my attitude is making up drift apart   
I've been dating a girl for 3 and half years.  We have a long distance relationship, where we usually see each other 2-3 times a month. (if we our schedules work).  When I first met her, she told me that she suffers from depression and told me that if I wanted to leave that she'll understand.  I told her that I would stick with her and help her through it because she really means a lot to me. Few years ago we had an engagement and had our wedding date set and everything ready to go.  Early last year (2016), just randomly one day, out of the blue, she texted me saying that she cannot do this anymore.  At first, I thought she had a rough day at work because her work was stressful and she was also going to school full time.  So I let her have a few days to herself, week or so had passed where she did not contact me and thats when I got concerned.  I got in touch with her family, where they also had noticed a change in her and did not understand what was happening with her.  (Her family does know about her depression).  She used to be on medication before I met her and then got off of them because she felt that she did not need them anymore.  I have given her some space and then went drove down a few times to surprise her with flowers and let her know that I still love her.  However, she was not excited to see me in return.  She has not given me any explanation as to why she ended it, she does not really talk that much to her family as well and she has not gotten into contact with me at all.  She has completly shut me out of her life.  It is very difficult to wrap my head around this all because her family told me that they have never seen her so happy and that she would constantly talk about me all the time.  She would also let me know everyday that we spoke as to how much I meant to her and all.  It is very frustrating and hard to not be able to get through to her and let her know that I am still there for her and love her.  Not sure as to what more I can do. 
Hi Everyone,   I like to ask, can one just get brain fog without depression? Or it had to be depression which leads to brain fog?   Regards, Marco 
Hi,  I'm currently on a reduced dose of my venlafaxine and have been now for around 2 months, maybe a little longer. I'm still getting the very depressive and anxiety states of mind. I'm actually writing because it seems to be effecting my boyfriend alot and I don't know how to help him understand that it's not him, it's not that I don't want to be with him or be around him, when I'm anxious or depressed I just shut down, it's the only way I can cope. Our relationship is pretty rocky already, he gets frustrated when he feels he can't help. I'm also not great at communication and he complains we don't talk much even when I tell him it's my anxiety or depression, he wants me to be more open with him so I've started telling him when I'm depressed or anxious and to be honest I feel I'm just moaning at him, like he doesn't really want to hear it. So yesterday, just to show him I'm still a fun person to be around, I was especially playful and funny and made sure I gave him as much of my attention as possible, he seemed in a really good mood too and seemed to appreciate the effort I was putting in. Tonight however depression just took over, I couldn't do much but sit on the couch curled in a ball, just a big hole in the pit of my stomach. I Forgot to go to the shop for milk and that started his bad mood, then I couldn't bring myself to just get up and open the door for the cat to go out, I felt so bad I just couldn't do motivate myself to get up and open the door. Now I don't think he's even talking to me, I'm not sure.  I've tried explaining what depression and anxiety are but unless you've actually been through it then it's hard to see my point of view.  What can I do? I feel if my depression and anxiety keep coming trumps in this relationship then it isn't going to last much longer, he will get to the end of his rope and leave. I don't blame him if he does, it must be really hard for him feeling we don't have a connection at times. Can anyone please give me some advice. Thanks 
i got made redundant before christmas that when i started to get it years a go i got depression had it bad my docter put me on lofepramine i have to take at night it the day time i get it bad can i take this tablet in the day time can you let me no 
Hello, I am sorry to put such a negative title to this forum post but I feel it is the only way to sum up how I feel. Is anyone else in the same boat as me? I feel like every single thing is pointless and mundane. I question in my mind constantly why people put so much effort and energy into things like making sculptures or painting art or putting their heart and soul into making a scaled village with small handmade green trees etc... I have just randomly chosen those examples but I feel like everything is pointless and I hate feeling this way. I think its really lovely that people enjoy these little things in life and I would love to put my energy into something like those people do but I just cant. I see people around me buying scented candles and ornaments and house decorations and I find myself thinking 'why bother?' And 'what is the point?'  I haven't always thought and felt like this, I used to love painting and drawing and being creative but I found that over the years I slowly lost interest to the point were I was forcing myself to try and enjoy those things. I am not organised at all, I look around my room now and there are piles of clothes I have not put away and the room is untidy but I find myself saying ' i will do it tommorow'. I really hate feeling like this and I feel as though I am wasting my life just sitting around everyday and doing nothing but I am finding it so hard to find motivation or energy to actually change my situation.   Here is some extra info: I am female I am 24 I have had blood tests for thyroid and diabetes and annemia and they have came back clear  I am currently on day 3 of taking Citalopram 10mg (for depression and anxiety) I have tried sertraline a year ago for 2 months and it did nothing. I have felt depressed for nearly 2 years now I have had tinnitus for 2 weeks now but that may be due to a sinus infection and symptoms are slowly going (I have taken antibiotics for 3 days) I have Nexplanon (contraceptive)   Thank you for taking the time to read this, I would love to talk to anyone about this situation as I dont really have any friends that I can talk to this about. 
As a long term sufferer of the Big D I know how very hard it can be to find anything in life to be happy about.  But my simple first post on this wonderful website is asking you to search your heart for something to be happy and grateful for in your life.  And if you can think of more than one thing thatâs great. But if you canât think of anything today then maybe youâd like you to keep thinking and asking yourself until you can, and when you do please share it with us all.  Search your heart for the smallest seed of happiness and letâs plant them all together.  Love, Tony 
 I don't no how to put this in a proper sentence I don't no if im sad angry depressed i just don't no what i feel or want anymore � my parents got divorced when i was one and ever since then I don't see or hear from my dad my mum got remarried when i was 6 years old my step dad was always very nice person but as i got older he changed because he had kids of his own he always screams at me if he sees me sleeping or sitting down im not allowed to be doing anything else but cleaning so practically im a slave i get told off if I don't do this he will kick me out he noes i have no where to go. And I don't have a job . I honestly don't no what to do anymore do i kill my self  
I have been suffering from depression since 2010 and finally decided to goto doctor in 2012 after few weeks on Escitalopram 10mg i got my life back and was quite happy and cofident and the glow I had because I was so happy. I went to London in 2013 and discontinue using it. I felt ok for a while then it hit me back in 2014. Then I was on and off on Citalopram 20 mg for a year. Finally, in 2015 I came back to Pakistan and was ok for a while then depression came back. I started Escitalopram 10 mg again and now on 20 mg. But I am not still feeling the same as I felt when I started using Escitalopram back in 2012. Though, the depression is not like as it used to be but deep down I am not that much happy.  Please suggest do I need to change my medication or keep on using it? 
The most important thing of all is to try and be happy. I do not have many,if any, friends, but I am happily married. I still get disappointed when things do not go the way I would like, or had planned in life. However, now I am beginning to see the big picture about it all. Material success and possessions, career & job success; money-they all will not mean squat when we die. Going to heaven and living the best possible life here on earth is the only thing that will matter when we die, after whatever suffering we may have to endure here on earth. Strive for your peace and happiness, trustworthiness, and your answers o life through God. This is the only way we are sure to find any type of comfort and long term contentment in this life. Just because other people seem to have success with careers and finances, does not mean they will not have to face dying one day. Therefore, thank God for everything you do have in this life,strive to be happy, pray, and look forward to a better life after this one, when we die from natural death the way God designed us to die(not from drugs, alcohol, or suicide). God Speed! 
Where to start first of all I'm extremely depressed and my anxiety is the worst its ever been I feel like just breaking down completely and telling my family I want to go in to mental hospital but I'm so scared if I do sign my self in I'll never come out of the place nearly every thought in my head is about my fear if dying I know how silly this must sound to other people but I just don't see the point of trying to live when I have to die someday I just can't accept what life is all about Im not able to deal with the reality of life at all I just don't know what to do with my self I wish I had the bottle to end my torment but sadly I don't whether that's a good ting or not I just don't know I really don't know how much longer I can take this hell I'm in yesterday I went to my local mental health clinic to seek help but all they want to do is throw more tables at my problem I'm really sorry this rant is so long but Im barley hanging on and I'm just so tormented please god will this hell ever stop for me ?????����������� 
Depression is like your brain is incarcerated!  When you break free of the depression, the freedom feels like a bird with an open cage.  Depression cannot last forever, only if you give in to it.  Take control, take the meds that work for you, move your body and be kind in your diet.  Have a good vitamine regime that works for you = there is alot of info. on the internet, look things up and don't wallow in your despair. 
I posted on here awhile ago but thought I'd update whats going on. My boyfriend of almost 9 years broke down to me about a month ago that he is depressed and lost in life. He is 27 and says he doesn't know how long he has had it but that he can't go on any longer like this. He asked for space and time.  He started becoming very distant. 2 weeks after he told me he had depression he broke up with me. He said he can't take care of someone else right now and needs to focus on himself. As much as I asked if I could help or stay and fix things he told me he needed to do this for himself and that we would see where we stand in the future.  2 weeks post breakup (Saturday) I went to talk with him because he told me he missed me and that he didn't know if he made the right decision. We both decided to try and figure things out together. We talked for awhile and realized we both somewhat lost ourselves in the relationship and need time alone to work on our personal selves and grow individually to be able to come back together as a couple.  We were living together but I moved back in with my parents. We decided to see eachother once or twice a week but to stay most time separated for now. I asked him to get help and he doesn't seem willing. He says he needs to figure this out himself. He says he hopes that we can fix things and find a solution that works and that space and time is the best for us.  What can I do during this time to help him out? I am trying to give him the space and time he needs but it is hard on me since I am used to spending almost every waking hour with him for the last 9 years. I am willing to fight for what we have because love makes you do crazy things. I want to text him and know what he is doing but don't want to push too hard either.   Any advice? He says I am the only person he has told. I think he's embarrased. I have told him that I would go to therapy with him. I encouraged that it's nothing to be ashamed of. Everytime I bring it up he either doesn't respond or walks away.. I feel like I am overstepping his boundaries at this point and need to avoid talking about therapy right now. Just need some guidance on how I can help him. I care deeply for him and want to find a way to help in anyway possible. 
I am sad   Im sad that my mum is dead. Im sad that my best friend is dead Im sad that I cope very weirdly with these things and I actually feel like my brain forces a door shut the very second I try to think about these things. It actually feels really heavy and like its constricting and only suppresses when I suddenly find myself concentrating on something, anything even the next word in this sentence. Then I feel terrible because I have stopped that emotion from flowing. I am sad I have reverted to writing it down as a resort. I am sad that I have no energy, no motivation and no drive. I really really want those things to come back but I just cant. The only time of the day I feel Ill ever have the energy is about 10 miniutes before I sleep and it all seems so easy. Then I wake up,stress about what Im going to eat but find even pouring cereal into a bowl so much more of a task than it should be, and that frustrates me. Though  who exactly cares and what difference would it make to how I feel. 0 percent and thats the icing. I dont even have the balls to save this file like everything else ill sweep it under the carpet, to the back of the mind most likely to resurface just that little bit worse the next time and so the cycle continues. Though I realise this aint exactly the healthiest thing to do I have pretty much lived my life around this cycle. The actual last time I can ever remember being truly content, with minor worries like how does my hair look or I wonder If she'll like me was when I was 16 years old.2007 to be exact. I feel like everything before that day was just a blur. Like a passed life almost though obviously not in a litteral sense. I wasent the easiest teenager to deal with always finding myself in some sort of trouble, mostly through experimentation, looking to impress everyone at every oppoprtunity, though thats just the way of it back then. Even though I know all that , spent 15 in a hostel etc none of it was in my mind hard to deal with (in my eyes) and to be brutally honest those years were the happiest of my life. Though after my mum died on something terrible happened to me. The worst of it was that the next 9 years of my life I pretended to myself that I had dealt with it well and that I could venture on and make her proud. Well thats come to be a fu**ing lie! I lied to myself with the only guess being for whatever reason my mind choose to subconciously put itself into a sort of denial which if never dealt with properly will hinder even the strongest willed person for the rest of their life! The scariest part of it all is that for years , and I need to reiterate this, I honestly believed that I had somehow managed to cope with this trauma very well.Though I was simply less opportunistic after that day. Trouble was I seen a lot of friends lose loved ones and I even lost one of my best friends recently. And on contemplating the differing emotional reactions from the vast majority to myself I noticed something which troubled me even further. I have for example spent the last 5 years of my life slowly deteriorating within myself, my confidence, my wellbeing, my will and most importantly my own happiness. I always put this down to some sort of life stress, breakups, things like that. And thus even after years of feeling sadder than I had been previously I put it all down to those experiences. It was only when my friend died I realised the stark difference in how I deal with the grief and trauma of someone dieing. I was able to erase it from my mind so much faster than anyone, and so fast even I made myself feel somewhat guilty about it. And thats when I started to ask the question of why I was able to deal with this in such a complete different manner. Sadly though hopefullyfor the best in the future I realised I had never grieved, not properly for anyone.  Not my mum and my friend and in forcing myself to continually delve deeper into the feelings I had for them and the things I loved about them I found myself in a whole new place of hurt. And I mean a whole new level of uncontrollable emotions to the point in felt my brain was going to explode. I started writing them down for the first time my feelings about them that was and I found myself that concentrated on what I was writing that my emotions switched. Completely, from uncontrollable sadness and tears to absolutelynothing. Like a numbing effect had occured. And that for me was the absolute moment I realised that I need to do something about the emotions I have buried deep within that have been stacking up until this day otherwise I dont think Ill even be capable of ever being happy again. Now I still do not classify myself as clinically depressed though Im borderline at the point between a rock and a hard place. If I continue down this path I fear Ill fall into something so much deeper and horryfying than it is right now. And that frightens me so much. I feel sadness for everyone in any similar positions and or with their own stories. Sorry for spelling. I never intended to post this as It was just meant to be a memo to self. Though in contrast I hope I help someone early in a similar scenraio to mine and that they choose to grieve. Before It comes back with a vengeance. 
Depression is slowly killing me. I've tried meds before along with excersise and hypnosis. Nothing seems to work. I can't find my purpose in this world and feel like maybe I just don't have one. Everything feels like it's  closing in I have no job,friends or money. I do have a boyfriend who is a compulsive liar which keeps me feeling crazy 24/7 but with no one else in my life to even talk to I put up with all his bull. I find myself constantly wishing I could be normal and live a normal life. My anxiety disorder has caused me to isolate myself further and I barely leave the house. The only reason I haven't actually killed myself is because I have family who I know would be devistated. But how long can I live in a world where I am never happy and constantly crying?how long should I suffer to make those around me happy? There wasn't really much of a point to this post pretty much just to vent to someone out there in cyber space thanks for listening (or reading I suppose lol) 
Hi! Sounds a bit daft I know but I am on 40mg of Citolapram from my anxiety and depression have been for about a year. I haven't had a week's dose as I was late on getting appointments my own fault I know but it's all sorted now with the pharmacy. I took them before and came off them and never had withdrawal effects like this before just ended up having panic attacks return, went off sick then doctor put me back on them.   So it's been a week and I don't feel depression just slightly edgy but I'm having terrible spouts of nausea and dizziness. Hard to explain the dizziness as it comes in waves and I never had this before when I was coming off citolapram. My whole head goes fuzzy and my cheeks and nose and fore head tingle. It's so bizzare but not good as I'm scared I might faint or loose balance when I'm in work. One min I feel like I'm gunna puke then suddenly I'm SUPER hungry I must eat about 7000 cals in a day! Now I did take a preg test just be safe and obvs came back neg as I have a copper IUD so that rules out the pregnancy but I just want to know if anyone has had these effects when coming off medication for depression or anxiety. I just don't want to have to make an appointment with the doctor and be told it's nothing as I do tend to over react lol.  Thanks for reading that you are a star!   
The last couple years i've been dealing with what i'm told is depression. I've felt this way for really as long as i can remember just on and off and much more subtle but, ever since highschool graduation it's manifested into something i don't want to live with anymore. It's not an exageration when i say nothing brings me happiness anymore. I can't stand being around my friends, family, and i dropped out of university three weeks in because i can't bring myself to try.  I have reached out a few times. The first few people i reached out to don't really keep in touch and at it did hurt but now i feel indifferent towards it. I told my mom and she brought me to my family doctor who started me on cymbalta (which i went cold turkey after a month and a half) and zoloft (which recently i went cold turkey on after my family doct gave me tryptophan and i ended up in emergency with serotonin syndrome.) The drugs made me restless and even more numb to my feelings to the point where i honestly rather feel suicidal than nothing, because it's something.  At the time i was working a horrible job at the dollarstore where my manager used up every last drop of energy i had in me. I got a new job after that stocking shelves at Costco but quit after a day because i knew i couldnt keep up with everybody's upbeat and annoyingly postitive moral. After i quit i spent a month unemployed, alone, and feeling so fed up with myself i tried to commit suicide. I failed and that's about the time i went back for more help and was started on zoloft. After a fight with my parents i went and got a job working for Walmart doing overnight stocking, which i do right now to this day. It's better than the other jobs i've had but it's still something that i don't want to do because realistically i don't have to do it. Plus being an overnight deal it was making my sleeping pattern ridiculous to where i was sleeping only maybe 3-4 hours every couple of days.  So i tried a couple sleeping meds, none worked, went to emergency for SS, quit my meds. In a last try for help a couple days ago i reached out to my bestfriend and simply he explained that maybe the reason why none of the people in my life have been around is because they don't know how to help, or maybe they didn't want to say the wrong things. That put things into perspective a bit but not really enough to make a difference in the wat i'm feeling. He also told me he wanted me to see an actual specialist and suggested i find a new job.  I made an appointment to see a psycologist this wednesday, and have an interview monday morning. But the thing is that i don't want to get better anymore. I really don't see the point in living. I don't want anything. I don't care for people or really their feelings. I don't want to try another round of meds. I don't want to go through the new job process again. I don't want to tell some stranger with a degree things i've repeated a million times.  When i when to the hospital with SS i thought i was having a heart attack. For a moment i thought i was going to die and i knew i could fight or take flight, but i fought. So that must mean there's something inside of me that still wants to live, right? But ever since it happened i've been wishing i would of given up and died.  This honestly might be the last time i ever post here. Everyday i get farther and farther away from wanting to live. I need a reason to try. What's the point in living if you can't enjoy it? Is there really a point of seeing a shrink? or even finding a new job if i'm going to feel the same?  I'm fed up.    
Hello, I'm really worried that my wife may have had or does have PND or some other depression - and is medicating with drink and cocaine at weekends.  I've NEVER used drugs. We have a 21 month old son (our first and planned) and bought our dream home nine months ago. We are the most tactile couple in public and all people tell me is that she is always talking about how much she loves me.  We're everbody's perfect couple, ultra happy and she started divorce proceedings overnight a few months ago and has rewritten history, didn't want to get married eight years ago, hasn't 'fancied' me for seven years, doesn't want sex with me (that side of things has always been great on both sides) and that I have been controlling her through our whole 11-year relationship - which is ridiculous.  And, no, there isn't anybody else in the picture - although, we are still living together and she is out looking for her 'special love' every weekend.  She is 35 and this has been going on since January when our boy was 15 months old.  We had 14 people round Christmas Day and she was talking about having another baby (no pressure from me always her decision if it happened). Two nights later we are at a club and a guy I know (very drunk) said he thought they might have gone out in the past. She stormed off and said "it's too late, I'm married". Then she's trying to meet up on FB, but he didn't want to know. She knows his partner and they have kids - it goes against every one of her morals.   Previously to this she has been the most loyal wife and tells people where to go, pointing at her wedding ring if they try to chat her up. But this time she told me it made her realise she has never loved me enough, that she deserves to find her special love and he was someone she had a crush on at 19 - WHAT!!!!!!!  I found out a few weeks after these revelations that she has been doing coke when she is out drinking until 3am in the morning - and she is a big drinker on a night out.Five weeks before all of this happened I got two birthday cards - one with a pic of me and the boy on the front to the 'Greatest Dad Ever' and another to 'My beautiful, amazing, gorgeous husband. I love you so much and thanks for making my life so special. You are such a great dad to **** it makes me love you even more'.  Now she refers to me on FB in her constant rants as a p***k or ugly, fat (I'm 11 stone at the moment), big-nosed c***  She is challenging me to get her drug tested saying she hasn't done it since she left me, as she was only doing it as she felt trapped.  I have since learned that she has dabbled in the past (despite being anti-drugs vocally as she is a fitness instructor) even before we were married and it has got worse since we have had our child. I believe she has had postnatal depression and this is how she is medicating it.  She says she isn't doing it, but two weekends ago she went out on a 12-hour bender on a Saturday and I saw her on Sunday morning in a right mess limping to work at 9am to teach her spin class.  At 4pm she was in the beer garden of another pub, completely OK and watching this band with a starry-eyed, almost adoring look on her face. She was then going up to everyone in the beer garden rubbing their hair and kneeling between their legs. And not for my benefit as she is emotionless towards me.  Later that evening she came to another bar I was at and one minute she was looking miserable outside the toilets, five minutes later she walks from the courtyard into the bar to push her way to the front of where a band is playing with her arms above her heard, with this weird, almost Jokerish grin on her face. Almost deranged looking.  Then she jumped up on a bench with three girls she didn't know and started dancing with and cuddling them all. Before talking to everyone in the crowd below. Then she is getting a drink at the bar and putting her arm round a complete stranger buying a drink and talking.  After she was outside pushing herself against a wall with the looney look on her face before being twirled round like a school girl.  She was having loads of intense conversations with strangers, then the next day she taught two classes in the morning after getting in at 2am, before trying to sleep on the sofa at 1pm. As she slept, her legs jumped around like electric shocks were going through them and her jaw was moving around.  The next weekend (I wasn't there) a friend told me she was spinning herself round a pole like a maniac on her own in a beer garden at 9pm one minute, then 20 minutes later her pals were consoling her like she was upset. A mate of mine who runs the club she was at later that night said she was in the toilets all night and had eyes like bowling balls, and was stroking his belly (and she never talks to him).  She is in complete denial telling me she hasn't done any drugs for three months and has got her solicitor to challenge me to hair test her. But I'm sure she must still be doing it!  She has also lost a lot of weight (at least a stone), she gets away with it on her body as she is so toned, but her face is so skinny, her cheeks have lost all their plumpness and she has aged. She went back to work in the gym six weeks after having our child, which was her decision she can't be controlled but massive mistake in hindsight as she never gave herself time to recover both physichally and mentally.  At he moment, it's like she has regressed back to when we first met 11 years ago (no drugs), but wanting to get drunk all of the time and really obsessed with local bands. And she used to do modelling pics in her teens, she went to a music festival for four days last weekend - and was being pictured posing on a car roof like some super model!  During this weekend away she never rang once or texted to check on our son - then when she comes back it is all 'I've missed you so much' etc  She is also very arrogant, thinks she is the sexiest woman on the planet and don't get me wrong she is very pretty -but now she can 'have any man that she wants' apparently!  I have ordered the drug test and will have to see what happens, but I am very worried about her as this is my beautiful wife.  In this nightmare six months I have not been able to have one conversation with her - she is ultra aggressive and defensive and just tells me I am 'harrassing' her, 'controlling her' and, now, 'bullying her'.  Something has gone really wrong with her - just hope she comes out of it before she destroys our little family for good!  Any advice/ideas?     
As I have been feeling better the last couple of months I just wanted to share a few things.  I find it important to constantly remind yourself that you are NOT alone in this - It is an real illness that many many people suffer with - although everyones experience is different, we all know how it can make us feel.  It is NOT permanant. I have suffered on & off for 9 years - I have been so low I thought I would never be able to get my life back & at times I didn't even want to. It is ok not to be ok.  You deserve to be happy. Depession can make you feel worthless & alone & like there is no point in getting out of bed in the morning but we are STILL here because we know we deserve to be happy, we know we can be happy & we know there are people that love & need us.   Look after yourself - If you need time alone, or a break then take it. YOUR MENTAL HEALTH SHOULD BE YOUR PRIORITY!  We have to be selfish sometimes. Some days I don't even want to speak to anyone or answer my phone so I don't. If you're feeling like you can't face the world right now then take time to mentally build youself up to it.  Although other people might not understand what we go through, we tend to be harder on ourselves than anyone else - the fact that we are all still fighting everyday & we keep going just shows how strong we are. It might not seem like it right now but we are AMAZING for being able to battle with this.  Hold on to anything that gives you any happiness even if it is temporary. If you feel yourself slipping or going to a dark place then act on it - speak to us, do something you enjoy, distract yourself, ride it out until you feel better.    These are all things we've heard a million times & sounds very cliche - but it's all true.   You are worth it, you deserve & you WILL be happy.  Love & support to you all   x     
I have been on citalopram for two weeks following severe anxiety after my girlfriend Left me. Trying to hang on and be strong as I have a little girl but things are now getting worse. I cannot seem to sleep at night for more that 3 hours and am sweating so much my bed is litterally wet. Does anyone else experience these side effects after two weeks and how long do they last. I am so close to binning these pills. Thanks in advance 
I suppose I'm posting this because I'd rather not trouble any of my friends with it, and my parents aren't likely to be of any use as proven from past experiences. For about three years now my severe anxiety has been apparent. There isn't a moment I'm not thinking about what others think of me and worrying about past present and future events. I'll avoid and regret social meetings more often than not. I've had repeated panic attacks and ever since my first counselling session about 3 years ago which seemed to open a damn. I try not to make it obvious, which of course makes it worse because I fear fear. Fear seems to be my top emotion. I fear everything but death. Over the last two years people have complained I have become less coherent, I'm trying very hard to make sure this makes sense but I apologise if I fail. Over the last year particularly I've been severely depressed, I cry often because all I want is to be dead but I'm aware that even if my friends and family don't like me all that much, my suicide is likely to effect their mental health and I love people far too much to do that to them. I sometimes sit accusing people of being selfish for forcing me to be alive (not to their face, to myself) but I know it's not really their fault, if I were just a little more selfish I could do it. Over the last year I've also being seeing things, in fact I have done whilst writing this. It shakes me and I start questioning if there's something actually there. Over the last several months I have been fearing people can read my mind, I used to do that but it didn't mean much because everyone did it and it was only a musing, but now it's constant and I monitor my thoughts in case someone reads them. I've asked people if they can read my mind but they don't answer and that scares me. I feel like I'm slowly loosing my mind, I can't do anything but fear and hate myself. I wonder if I have a cancer in my brain or something but I doubt that makes sense. I don't care about deadlines, I have no motivation. This is ruining my life and future and all I can think is if only I were dead. What do I do? I can't get help and my doctor is reluctant to offer medication although I do worry that if i did, during the 'down period' I'll loose control and kill myself. Thanks for reading, there's a lot here.  
Hi I stumbled onto this site by accident and I am so glad I did. Although I am so sorry and sadend to see that so many people feel like this and wish with all my heart that they get better soon as I know how terrible this is, I am comforted by the fact that I am not alone (I really don't mean that in a bad way). I have been feeling like I am going crazy and everyone around me is sane. I have had depression for four years on and off and am on my third day of being back on anti depressants again. I just feel like this is a never ending story and will I ever get better and feel good and be really happy again or will I just have to grin and bare it and keep up the pretense and the mask I grudginly put up in public. I can't take this anymore. I get over the depression, get myself and my life back on track and then out of nowhere it returns and pulls me down into the blackness and I wish with all my heart I could take it away. Like if your not well and you need an operation, they take the bit thats bad for you away, how much easier would it be if you could do that for depression. I am tired so so tired of this constant battle to live with this. I just wanna feel like me again, I used to be so happy and bubbly (to the outside world I still am) but its all an act and I am so tired of the pretense. I don't wanna fight with myself or my feelings anymore. I don't wanna dread goin to bed because I know I won't be able to sleep so I stay up till 7am until I'm shattered and then go to bed only to find that the only thing that is tired is my body and my mind is still wide awake! I don't wanna dread waking up in the morning to face another day of this hell. I sometimes wish that I could take my brain out for a day (if that makes any sense) just so I can get some piece. I don't wanna be scared anymore, scared of my feeling like this, scared of being in groups of friends, scared of leaving my house alone (which bizarly doesn't bother me if I am with someone, but its really not that helpful as I live alone), scared of people finding out that I wear this mask, scared of people thinking that I have completely lost the plot, scared of looking stupid, scared of being laughed at, scared of being talked about, scared of being hurt, scared of living.  I have had depression on and off many times in the four years I have had it and have lost count in the amount of times I have been on anti depressants, but why oh why does it get harder to deal with ever time it hits you, or is it just me, am I so weak that I can't fight this and everyone else can? I over think things, over explain myself, over react and really really feel like I am going mad!! My brain has never been so overactive (if I was like this in school I would have been a genius by now). I can't take it and I am soooo sick of the whole situation. I am constantly dreading something happening (what I have no idea), I used to be a really happy optamistic person and now if something good happens I am like, yeah wonder how long it will take till that turns to crap...oh look it just did. I can't help it I even hate the way this sounds as I am typing it I just wanna scream at myself get over it!!! But it won't go away :cry:  Does anyone really and truely get over this or is it something that just hangs over you for the rest of your life, because I can't take this. I just want to feel normal again and happy. I don't want to feel like I am alone and some kind of freak because no one around me understands, I don't want to feel parranoid anymore or filled with dread. This is the worst thing I have ever experinced and I wish I could rip it out of me and stamp on it because I don't wanna fight anymore. I'm tired of the fight  :cry:  [quote:d47714d9a0][/quote:d47714d9a0] 
Just thought I'd add as there was nothing about this drug listed save for one short post.   Took Burproprion for 9 months with Fluox for depression, I found  the step-up onto the drug fairly easy - only some medium level  anxiety and some agression/anger flashes, that said I am not especially sensitive to those kind of side-effects, If you are might be worth using  caution.   What I would say is I mainly took this drug to try and resolve the total apathy I feel about just about everything and It did little to nothing  to relieve that nor did I feel any extra legwork vs depression (still Not wanting to leave the house, black mood, not thinking about the future etc). I can say I felt mentally sharper and perhaps slightly more social.   Also I recommend you research this drug carefully before taking it as  it has been implicated [u:9451624106]Directly[/u:9451624106] in deaths associated with cardiac issues etc. It also increases risk of siezure.  Coming off of the drug was a non issue - stopped dead no sideffects  beyond headache and feeling slightly blunted.   Anyways thought I'd write a little about it, It should be noted that the  drug is approved for use only for its Anti-smoking benefit in the UK  though it is used for depression elsewhere, if you want it for depression in the UK you will need to get to a consultant I would think to get it off label. 
Hi   I've been suffering badly for 3 years now, herniated disc and DDD in L5 S1, pain down both legs to the point I can't stand up straight or walk with out painful electric shock like pains. I take a alot of pain medication and have had 3 steroid injections. My last one was Sept and was great until I had a woman crash into the back of me with serious effect to my back. I am now waiting to see my consultant on 7th February- the earliest appt available since the crash in November!!. I can't do anything try as I might. I'm lucky as my partner is amazing and my boys help enormously. This has had an enormous effect on my whole life, I can't work due to the tablets i take and my depression is at an all time low. I'm 41 and am like an 80 year old. I also have osteoarthritis.  I try to walk and keep active but it's a viscous circle with my low mood  . I am in Liverpool which has a great neuro depth at the Walton centre but I am with an orthopaedic consultant in the spine depth at the local hospital in town. I just want to be back room some k8nd of normality. x  My meds are pregabalin 600mg naproxen 1000mg dihydracodiene 240mg paracetamol 2 x 4times a day this, I have been told is a foundation for all the other meds to work on - I take all this and my venlaflaxine (exilir in US I think) but am still in huge amounts of pain  Please does anyone have any tips ideas or questions I should ask thee consultant? He said if the 3rd injection didn't work then he would do a disc fusion, this is making me more anxious and although it could help there is also horror stories of it being worse after. I'm at a complete loss  Thanks for taking time to read my post xxxx

Hilary  >  
Hope this works I'm sitting in my car in the car park, scared, shaking and thinking that people are conspiring to get me especially at work. I don't know who to trust anymore. I don't know what to say to who or what anymore.  I've tried being open and honest but seem to be digging myself into a large hole. I want to run away but from who? Is it me? Or is the people after me. My heads in a spin, just don't know what to do.  been having lots of weird dreams, suicidal thoughts again this week, hurting myself trying to make things feel real. Debating going walking up in the hills in the rain at least no one can get me there as no one will know where I am. Not sure if this makes sense but needed to put this somewhere.  Thanks.  X  
I have been feeling depressed on and off for about three years now. I have never been "diagnosed" as I have never actively seeked help. I have been able to tolerate it up until now, even though there have been some very dark times, however recently it has been getting worse and I have noticed how much it is impacting on my life.  I feel exhausted all the time. Small jobs like washing the dishes or laundry feel like monumental tasks. I have started a new job recently however that has only made things worse. My lack of motivation makes me feel guilty which feeds my exhaustion and it all just becomes a viscious cycle!  My social life has been non-existent since I finished University (about two years ago). I moved out of my parents' house into a house share at the beginning of the year with the intent of making friends and meeting new people. Unfortunately this hasn't worked out the way I had hoped and I am just left feeling even more lonely, often going back to my parents' house. I have a few close friends from school still kicking around, however they make me feel angry as they never return my calls or texts and only seem to want to meet up when they have something to gain from it (e.g. a lift or free food/ drink).   Recently I have been becoming very hateful and isolated (even more so than usual!). I can't see how things are going to get any better unless I do something about it, however I don't know what to do. I went to see a doctor when I first started feeling really bad. They suggested counselling, however by the time they offered me an appointment I had finished my final year exams so I was on a bit of a high and didn't think I needed it! This has made me hesitant to go to a doctor again as I'm worried they would just fob me off and it wouldn't get sorted.  I find this very difficult to talk about, more so to convey my feelings in so many words! I could fill a book with my negative and hateful thoughts. Therefore I would really appreciate it if anyone could offer any advice on how to go about fixing this and getting my life back on track.  Many thanks   
I am so terribly depressed and overwhelmed. I am so fatigued and angry. I'm raising 3 grandchildren who have physical and emotional issues. I'm angry at all of the parents involved. I'm am about to the end of my rope with problems stemming from lack of sleep, I'm a third shift worker, financial burden, children issues, I'm just overwhelmed and angry. I don't know where to turn. I don't feel my doctor actually listens to me when I go see him, so I don't bother. Nobody I talk to underdtands, possibly because they don't have the same issues. I just told my husband I am done, I'm exhaudted. I'm tired of taking care of everyone, and I'm tired of cleaning up after people. I've done it for 40 years. I need a break, my health is suffering. 
I had surgery 5 months ago. I now have depression and anxiety. I have been on zooloft for 7 weeks. I can't sleep or eat. I can't think beyond this. I have nothing to focus on. I feel so aweful and alone. I truly don't know what to do. My stomach is on fire. I feel so afraid all the time. I have no friends and my husband is tired of this place I am in.  It's New Year's Eve and my son is going out. This is stressing me out. I hallucinated for years prior to surgery. I guess I am just reaching for something.  
Hi all,  So for the past 12 months I have been dealing with depression. Throughout that time I have been seeing a private psychiatrist with the Priory Group. I have been on Citalopram, Quetiapine, escitalopram, and Venlafaxine.  I feel very steady currently, however the venlafaxine just doesnt seem to be doing anything apart from make me moody and want to isolate myself. After a conversation with my parents, I am flirting with the idea of coming off medication altogether to see how I 'truly' am without the meds.  The ultimate decision lies with me, and people can only advise and pass on their experiences I know, but I would love it if anyone could offer their advice & guidance.  Thanks!   
I don't trust my own mind/thoughts anymore!  I try so hard to relay things in my mind and make sense of them but I'm still so confused!  I feel that I'm doing/trying my best but I'm told otherwise so I can't trust anything I think or feel anymore and it's just the worst!  I've always known I'm not a normal person but I thought I was a good person, or at least tried to be...now? I'm so confused! And my head is more messed up than it ever has been. I can't trust my own thoughts anymore, it's horrible, it's hard and is scary! I feel so lost I can't even begin to explain! I don't know who I am anymore � 
So, this is how I went from a normal studious teenager to a intensely depressed 20 year old. I kind off still need help to understand what is actually happening to me at this point. I know the main things are depression and anxiety, but some of the things I do I just can't understand. Please help me if you can. So this is how my experience goes -  I was born in 1996. I was a happy kid and was studious and scored good marks at school but it all started at around the age of 14 (ie-at eight grade at school).  Age 14: I come from a very studious family who care only about studies and they are extremely negative and comparative in nature. They made me study non-stop at those times. As studies is a quite a big deal in India, I naturally with this family background became intensely introverted and never had friends. My parents often instilled in me notions that friends are fake and are not important in life and I began to grow from that.        So, at the eight grade while following my routine of intense study, I eventually felt some kind of pain in my mind. My mind was going on and on with thoughts, creating doubts about the smallest things and I ended up 'talking' to my mind voice and answering all its doubts and thoughts. I just don't know how to explain this exactly in words. But moving on to age 15  Age 15: My mind voice intensifies. I become more social withdrawn. I spend hours and hours talking back to my mind even while studying. I can't figure out what's happening to me.  Age 16: I'm in tenth grade(The 'biggest' year in India). My parents pressurise me even more in studies. As soon as I enter home, I would be made to close my room door shut and study. This ended up being very bad for my inner mind. I had no inner peace, had intrusive thoughts, had intense compulsions like talking stressfully back to my mind( acting like the problem was solved after that) , writing compulsively on paper to answer back to my thoughts. And this is the scariest part - As my study holidays for my boards began, my mind began to roar even more. I ended up questioning how to read words, how to remember the alphabets. I began to feel pain while reading with anxious thoughts like 'what if the alphabet 't' i read does not have a cross over it' or 'what if the alphabet 'i' i read does not have a dot over it' or same double letter patterns. I began to slow down in reading and then began to constantly question the meaning of words even though sub consciously I know what they all meant. Like I would ask what some word means and when I explain it to myself, I would ask what another word in that explanation meant and I would go on and on like this. I was so scared, I was alone with no one to talk to. But i passed out decently from tenth grade with this wounded mind.  Age 17 and 18: I had two months of vacation where I tried to relax but my mind disrupted my peace. While playing games/watching movies , my mind would constantly create questions. I tried ways to overcome my reading issues anxiety but it still persisted. I moved to a new college for 11th and 12th grade. This was a more free college with people being more social and having more friends. I just couldn't fit at all and was constantly bullied and called things like 'pussy', etc. It was at this time that I realised how 'shy' and 'anxious' I felt deep down. I felt inferior to everyone and developed this inferiority complex. I with pain managed to get to a large extent over this reading anxiety and was able to things better but my mind still was restless. I felt lonely and couldn't make friends. I got attracted to people of the opposite gender(a natural thing btw) but could never make friends with anyone(with people of same gender also). I wanted to be friendly with people and just help people and be friends with everyone, but I couldn't. I just wanted friends thats all I wanted. But I helplessly watched all my other classmates make friends , have amazing times with each other,post hundreds of pictures with each other on fb. I felt so sad and alone with this damaged mind. I couldn't even say 'hi' to people. I watched on as I could not function on days like 'graduation day' , 'picnics' , etc. I had no people to talk to while evryone else enjoyed. After 12 th grade, I spun into this intense depression  Age 19 and Age 20- Had 2 months of vacation. Was intensely depressed. My mind had two sides of pain- one academical and the other social. I would reimagine incidents of bullying in my mind and times I failed to make friends even when I so badly wanted to. While studying, my mind would go nuts over simpliest things. I feel this is more of anxiety because when the time came, I did pretty well in tests. I became intensly suicidal (I am not now  ) and dreamt off jumping from a building. Moved to a new college for B.Tech in Computer Science. I couldn't make friends with my intense depression and I became more withdrawn. I self-medicated on Paxil (which made feel lazy and uninterested). I felt this deep pain in my mind and my heart. Later my parents themselves met a doctor and I was prescribed Clonazepam (known as Petril in my country). I felt relaxed and nice after having it for a few days and then demanded my parents to give it to me at a regular basis. I feel my mind subside and able to do thing better with this drug. But if not given, I would feel some intense mind pain. I tried meditation with music and it did feel nice but still I would feel these mind pains I can't control. My anxiety is too painful at times to bear.  a) So, can someone explain what is going on with my mind? Why is it like this? b) How do I get my life back? How do I get interested in life and make friends with people? c) How can my mind be tamed?  Please help if you can. Thanks a lot!  
Hi everyone, I'm depressed and I kinda like it. I've been this way for 4 years now, and I don't know why I don't want to change the situation.  All I want to change is my personality and I can say I'm achieving this goal, or at least that's what it seems. I can't remember who I was and honestly I don't want to. I'm young and I think this makes possible the act of changing myself. It seems people like me more this way and so do I.  Does any of you tried this in past ? Do you miss your old self ?     If not, do you feel happier now ?  Finally, was it really worth it?   
I'm really in a bad place right now and I don't know what to do or how to stop this hell I'm in I'm so depressed and tormented right now I feel like just crying my eyes out I don't seem to have any control over all the poor and negative thoughts that are racing through my mind every second of every day and night especially the non stop thoughts of dying I am attending my local mental health clinic and the last appointment I had a few weeks ago I did try to tell the doctor everything and i mean everything but it was a complete waste of time I've come close a good few times to telling one of my family or even my friend but they have their own problems especially my mother who us dealing with depression her self. I really can't see a way out if this hell I'm in or ever leading a normal life ����� 
I'm a 20 year old guy I have a quite a few friends, I'm not good at studies, my parents hate me and remind me of my faults and discourage me a lot I've got no one to talk to and I feel like committing suside every day , I'm completely useless and got no hope for myself I'm extremely depressed and have started inflicting self damage my parents are ashamed to even talk about me to others and think that I'm a disgrace to them I have got no moral support and was trusting in myself and God, but now I Ve lost my trust and have decided to end my life soon .  I know taking here won't help me but this seems to be the only place I can express myself . Thanks that you have read it, See you guys in after life  
Hi all,  I think this is my 3rd post on here now. Ive written a few things before about my journey with anxiety and depression and also some bits on my journey with sertraline.  Just when i thought i was starting to feel a bit better things have come crashing down. To cut a long story short there was a family row on christmas day which lead to me sitting in a field on my own. I felt so bad about this argument and started to google ways of suicide. For the past 5 or so months ive been up and down with suicidal thoughts but have always told someone and realised they are just thoughts. I think ive frightened myself now though by actually googling it. I dont actually want to die but i dont want to feel like this any longer. Ive got a call booked in tomorrow with my gp just for some reassurance that just because i googled it and didnt just think of it doesnt mean im actually going to do it. I wish this cloud of depression would just lift again  
Hi. I don't even know if this is the right section but I am freaking out so I need to ask anyway. I have been on Celexa and Wellbutrin together, 10mg, and 300mg, respectively for about 3 months. I am a young male, late 20's and never had a problem in my life with a desire for sex. However, I have noticed lately that I would choose a movie and a bowl of popcorn over the sexiest women on the planent. I have even had trouble getting aroused, and staying aroused. Does anyone know if this is normal and if so, will it go away if the meds are stopped? I know you shouldn't stop cold turkey but when it comes to this I am without a choice. I am wondering if this is permanent or how long I should expect things to be this way...  Please help.  Thanks 
Ok it's me, I'm the one always able to offer advise over the last few months. I've been on sertraline for over a year now! Been doing well, haven't had a blip since April! Today I started feeling down, got tears � and had to go for a walk, feeling 60% better but still a little numb to be honest. I should say I have been cutting down my meds for the last 2 months just cutting off a quarter of my 50mg tablet and taking the rest. Somebody plz give me some advice , and reassure me it's a blip. I have had a terrible sleeping pattern too , for last 2 or 3 weeks.  Be nice to chat with you people who understand x 
i have vitilgo and it sucks, i lost a hand full of friends becuase my self esteem went down lol 
I'm in a situation where I want to step away from my nonbiological daughters life. I lived with my ex for approximately two years and now we are separated. Times have been very hard for me because I feel forgotten and that I don't matter to my ex. She gives me mixed signals all the time then the following day tells me to forget about everything and to not think much of any interaction that occurred the previous day. This has occurred multiple times after our separation and it breaks me apart every time it happens, sending me back to square one each time. Moving on has become extremely difficult for me for this same reason.  I love my daughter very much and she loves me just as much. I met her as a baby so she thinks of me as her father. Her biological dad is not in the picture whatsoever so if I were to walk away I feel like it'll be me the one that gave up on her. At the same time I can't bare the idea that there is a possibility that another man could walk in her life and enjoy her daily presence, instead of me. For as much that it breaks my heart I feel that walking away from everything will be the ultimate way for me to move on. I see my daughter as the last piece of hope in working out something with my ex, and this hope and my ex's words are causing me to fall into depression. At first her mother said she will not be seeing anyone for a long time and two months after our breakup it seems that she is going on dates with old guy friends.  Both of us being in our early 20's tells me that maybe she wants to experience things she never did. She began exercising, she cares for her appearance more, she has open her old social media accounts and she is "living" life. This was not the girls I was seeing she would talk about marriage and increasing our family. Now it seems that all that was a lie. I don't know what to do. Everything seems like she stopped loving me and was waiting for the right time to let everything go. I want to move on and try to live a normal life, I'm tired of being in my room in the darknes but my mind is consumed of thoughts like what we could have been, or why she forgot about me so fast and in such harsh manner. If she wants to move on it's okay but why the mixed signals. Sorry if my text was jumping everywhere hope I got my point and views across. Thank you. 
So, this is how I went from a normal studious teenager to a intensely depressed 20 year old. I kind off still need help to understand what is actually happening to me at this point. I know the main things are depression and anxiety, but some of the things I do I just can't understand. Please help me if you can. So this is how my experience goes -  I was born in 1996. I was a happy kid and was studious and scored good marks at school but it all started at around the age of 14 (ie-at eight grade at school).  Age 14: I come from a very studious family who care only about studies and they are extremely negative and comparative in nature. They made me study non-stop at those times. As studies is a quite a big deal in India, I naturally with this family background became intensely introverted and never had friends. My parents often instilled in me notions that friends are fake and are not important in life and I began to grow from that.  So, at the eight grade while following my routine of intense study, I eventually felt some kind of pain in my mind. My mind was going on and on with thoughts, creating doubts about the smallest things and I ended up 'talking' to my mind voice and answering all its doubts and thoughts. I just don't know how to explain this exactly in words. But moving on to age 15  Age 15: My mind voice intensifies. I become more social withdrawn. I spend hours and hours talking back to my mind even while studying. I can't figure out what's happening to me.  Age 16: I'm in tenth grade(The 'biggest' year in India). My parents pressurise me even more in studies. As soon as I enter home, I would be made to close my room door shut and study. This ended up being very bad for my inner mind. I had no inner peace, had intrusive thoughts, had intense compulsions like talking stressfully back to my mind( acting like the problem was solved after that) , writing compulsively on paper to answer back to my thoughts. And this is the scariest part - As my study holidays for my boards began, my mind began to roar even more. I ended up questioning how to read words, how to remember the alphabets. I began to feel pain while reading with anxious thoughts like 'what if the alphabet 't' i read does not have a cross over it' or 'what if the alphabet 'i' i read does not have a dot over it' or same double letter patterns. I began to slow down in reading and then began to constantly question the meaning of words even though sub consciously I know what they all meant. Like I would ask what some word means and when I explain it to myself, I would ask what another word in that explanation meant and I would go on and on like this. I was so scared, I was alone with no one to talk to. But i passed out decently from tenth grade with this wounded mind.  Age 17 and 18: I had two months of vacation where I tried to relax but my mind disrupted my peace. While playing games/watching movies , my mind would constantly create questions. I tried ways to overcome my reading issues anxiety but it still persisted. I moved to a new college for 11th and 12th grade. This was a more free college with people being more social and having more friends. I just couldn't fit at all and was constantly bullied and called things like 'pussy', etc. It was at this time that I realised how 'shy' and 'anxious' I felt deep down. I felt inferior to everyone and developed this inferiority complex. I with pain managed to get to a large extent over this reading anxiety and was able to things better but my mind still was restless. I felt lonely and couldn't make friends. I got attracted to people of the opposite gender(a natural thing btw) but could never make friends with anyone(with people of same gender also). I wanted to be friendly with people and just help people and be friends with everyone, but I couldn't. I just wanted friends thats all I wanted. But I helplessly watched all my other classmates make friends , have amazing times with each other,post hundreds of pictures with each other on fb. I felt so sad and alone with this damaged mind. I couldn't even say 'hi' to people. I watched on as I could not function on days like 'graduation day' , 'picnics' , etc. I had no people to talk to while evryone else enjoyed. After 12 th grade, I spun into this intense depression  Age 19 and Age 20- Had 2 months of vacation. Was intensely depressed. My mind had two sides of pain- one academical and the other social. I would reimagine incidents of bullying in my mind and times I failed to make friends even when I so badly wanted to. While studying, my mind would go nuts over simpliest things. I feel this is more of anxiety because when the time came, I did pretty well in tests. I became intensly suicidal (I am not now smile ) and dreamt off jumping from a building. Moved to a new college for B.Tech in Computer Science. I couldn't make friends with my intense depression and I became more withdrawn. I self-medicated on Paxil (which made feel lazy and uninterested). I felt this deep pain in my mind and my heart. Later my parents themselves met a doctor and I was prescribed Clonazepam (known as Petril in my country). I felt relaxed and nice after having it for a few days and then demanded my parents to give it to me at a regular basis. I feel my mind subside and able to do thing better with this drug. But if not given, I would feel some intense mind pain. I tried meditation with music and it did feel nice but still I would feel these mind pains I can't control. My anxiety is too painful at times to bear.  a) So, can someone explain what is going on with my mind? Why is it like this? b) How do I get my life back? How do I get interested in life and make friends with people? c) How can my mind be tamed?  Please help if you can. Thanks a lot! 
Alright, I want to begin by saying that my husband doesnt always act like this. It happens on occasion, but never several days in a row. It might happen once or twice a month though.   My husband goes into this state where it seems like he doesn't care about anything. Not me, himself, his family, or his life.    The main problem being he had one of these bouts the other day. But this one was the worst because it's affects our relationship majorly.   It all started out about me making a joke (can't remember exactly what I said) and it all ended up turning into him complaining about losing him freedom to do whatever he wanted because I moved in. In short, he was saying that I'm a burden to him. But he was being dodgy about it. Like he didn't exactly want to say "you're a burden and you're ruining my life. Get out." Rather he sat their and listed all the things he'd rather have done and how we can't even fix them anymore because I have nowhere else to go. Now, truthfully that isn't true. I would have places to go, but I don't want to leave him. I asked him, "do you love me anymore?" And he said he didn't know. He did say that he thinks he does because he loves me in same way he loves his parents? But he even said he doesn't even know if he loves his parents. He did say there are things he loves about me. But there are things he can't stand that I do. The problem being, I myself am not going to completely bend to his will. I will do things for him, but I can't do things exactly the way he wants because I'm me. I was crying my eyes out, having a complete mental breakdown. And he didn't care that I was crying. He had no reactions to it. It also doesn't help that I suffer from anxiety disorders and have a tendency to lose my mind    Right now, everything is back to normal. We say we love each other, we kiss and cuddle, we work together, laugh together, I make us dinner and we spend time together. But even now, I wonder if I'm just trying to convince myself that everything is alright as a means of escaping the truth because I can't handle the pain. I turn my mind off so I don't have to think. But, he really doesn't act like this often. He just has strange bouts of how unhappy he is with the way things are. And I feel like he feels he needs to blame something, and that something is me? I don't know. If someone could give me advice on how to help him, please do. I love him more than life itself. I want him to be happy.   
I am feeling very depressed and have absolutely no one to talk to. My only means of financial support is the income from my job.  I have an abusive supervisor and after months of putting up with this situation I have finally reported her to human resources.  I'm very concerned about the possibility of losing my employment. 
Kinda a long story..   Last week my gf of over a year ended it with me, because of what I done,  A few weeks prior to her ending it she had a chat with me and said she had lost feelings for me as we didn't get much space from each other, I reacted badly and messaged some friends for advice and without meaning to slagged my partner off (I didn't mean it to come across that way) Anyway I was afraid to talk to talk to her regarding how I felt and she found the messages to my friends and finished it with me kicking me out, I left and had no where to go due to family break downs, so I returned back to my partners house as she said she didn't want me sleeping in the car, I tried talking to her and tried to sort things out and shes certain that it's over for good, I've messed everything up and have lost it all, my fiancée, family, cat and home.. I really don't want to lose her but I'm sure I have, I'm currently giving her space and am returning back tomorrow, I really don't want to carry on anymore as I've got nothing, I'm so lost and don't know what to do!  
For the past couple months I have started to feel a lot worse. Stuff happens, and I am not really equiped to handle it. I just feel really drained and have this need to be fake and put on a fake smile and pretend that everything is OK. I honestly feel like I don't deserve to mope all day, and it's like this endless cycle of the same hopeless crap day after day. I constantly switch from pain to emptiness in a short period of time. I don't really expect anyone to respond or care but I just wanted to get my thoughts out. 
Anyone dealing with pschosomatic fallout from depression?  How have you got on?  Any advice?  I like to think that I've sorted my underlying depression (primarily through being kinder to myself, CBT and early retirement) but have a series of minor-but-debilitating health issues where essentially the medics can find no obvious physical cause.  Unfortunately, the pain, discomfort and their lengthening illness from a bug depresses me.  I'm left with tiredness and lethargy (I'm investigating low Vitamin B12 and a less-than-ideal thyroid), neuropathic pain at the sight of a nose operation 20 years ago, tooth pain with no cause found, a chronic cough (this may be from post-nasal drip) that has been particularly bad over the last few months, feelings of suffocating and a tight chest with peak flow lung capacity less than 2/3 of the expected figure, restless legs (horrible, horrible, horrible)ove. One or 2 of them I could cope with, but I now just feel overwhelmed. 
I feel so numb. I have been feeling numb but I had thoughts almost like I want physically there but I was mentally sometimes there (always sad but still there) I was just stuck in my head. Been on Zoloft for 4 weeks and now mentally I'm gone too so now I'm just completely numb.  
2016 has been one of the worst years of my life ! Mum passed away 29th March  Because a hospital gave her a drug they Knew she had a serious allergy to! November 16th my Dad passed away, As per norm he went the way he would have  wantedA glass of Vodka TV on laying on the sofa,yet completely different to how  He lived ,he died peacefully ! I still try to get out but still find it very difficult! Panic attacks are worse,  I sometimes sit here thinking "perhaps tonight it'll be my turn"almost wishing  for death.Yet i don't want to die? I have to look after my Mary and my Parrot freinds I sat at home on Christmas alone I know this sounds daft I was angry that the  great escape was not on! I really miss my family yet they don't appear to miss me! I have an appointment at last for pain management 24th January.  I know 2017 can't get anywhere near as bad as 2016 but I will wait and see Sorry for not being very positive but have to say it as it appears to me!  
Hello I'm Ernest, I'm 15 years old now and I dont think i see any bright future that I could he having because throughout this year I have been having badluck almost everyday and it got to me to the point I feel nothing right now, not even positive or negative feelings. I have gone through alot of pain that I even feel sorry for myself everyday of my life. I had made resolutions to make as many people happy as I could so that I could be happy as I comfort them but in the end I realized I made people happy but they can't do the same for me even with the closest friends I have seem to be annoyed when I open up to them because they don't understand what I'm going through... So basically I give more than what I receive and I really wish there was a person out there willing to sacrifice his/her time and effort to make me happy as I've done to a lot of people this year..  I've been used a lot especially by those I used to open up to.earlier this year I had a terrible heart break by a girl who lied to me that she loved me and with me believing it I loved her so much but in the end I realised all of it was fake even tho I kept a lot of effort in it..... My last best friend ended up stealing the girl I loved as he used me the whole and the girl didn't even love me as I had taken months of effort and still nothing... She used me and I crossed her ocean she had never touched mine. And now since she's with my exbest friend she comes to me once in a while with her problems about him and expecting me to fix her thus even though I accepted us to be friends she only comes to me when she needs something.. I had to spend november and December crying and try to hold in the pain because I had no one to help me but once I did I got through it then again it hurts everytime I remember their names.. I don't have the best of parents that could make a kid feel good after a long emotional day because they do not understand what I'm going through even my two brothers dont, I usually end up sleeping in my bedroom isolated from everyone even during daytime because I dont want them to see me this way as I'm sad every single day, my parents usually like shouting at me even when its not my fault, my dad thinks his a perfectionist while nobody is perfect but he tries to make me believe his way is always right but many times his wrong and sometimes even not followibg the child's right to be heard or respected, that's the same thing with my mom and it gets worse once u start arguing the truth as they would us age as superiority but they don't understand what's right is right and what's wrong is wrong no matter what age you are, they don't listen, they're already suxked into that mentallity deeply, this is why I never open up to my parents even when you try to speak what you feel, its always about what they love and hate never about my opinions, sorry that may seem selfish but I'm not usually like that I help my closest friends first before I think of myself and that makes me happy for a little while, they can't do the same with me..   I'm depressed I barely smile out of good thoughts like I used to. I don't have that much great memories of my 2016 because almost everytime bad things happen to me especially with these family problems I'm facing these holidays... I really made a lot of peoe happy and I'm proud of that but I'm not proud of myself because I'm down everyday and I try my best to get through it even when I have to fake that I'm happy while I'm not. I pray on these bad things to stop happening every night but idk why life has been doing this to me... I seem to be the difficult one in my family because I'm always sad and angry... I used to control what I do in my life where I go but now things change, I'm not in control, my mother has lost trust in me while I try to make her happy, I'm basically the most sweet hearted guy to ever meet but no one seems to understand me and help me as I did for them.. I still have very little hope my 2017 will work out fine but that depends if I manage to change myself and devote most of my time trying to fix myself instead of wasting my time on others who don't even appreciate me To be honest I'm scared of my future if this continues... 
Its now 2 am, been out on a xmas staff night out, obviously drunk too much had quite an  enjoyable evening out compared to last night where when waking in the morning found out I had cut die, hate and evil  in my stomach blood all over the sheets. this is what I think about myself, I vaguely remember doing it but not really. How stupid is that especially as I had come  to terms with the memories I had from childhood and decided to talk to someone about them. Not that I have talked them out loud yet. feel very ashamed and embarressed by this but there is nothing I can do to get rid of them apart from crossing them out. Plenty of water before bed.  
I've been prescribed a 50mg dose of sertraline for anxiety and depression. I'm having recurring suicidal thoughts and have read many forums about how these can be increased for under 25 year olds when first taking them. I don't have a will to live anymore. I am scared about taking these but would very much like to improve my condition.   This has stopped me enjoying family time tonight as I've wanted to be alone and have these thoughts run through my head. 
I asked my  grandmother, "If you had to choose between something meaningful in your life that was permanent  or something that was important  that was only temporarily, what one would you choose?"    She chose the meaningful one.  She wanted something that was with her for a lifetime, something that was so valuable, she couldn't stand to let go.  And that's when I knew, who I should be with.  
Good morning,  About a year ago my wife was suicidal, mainly due to her job. She received help and now takes medication for depression, anxiety and adhd. She has a college degree but realized that she couldnât be successful in her job and quit. Since then, she has been working manual labor temp jobs. The problem is she can no longer take any type of bad news/criticism. For example, she was told she didnât do something good enough at work and it ruined her day, to the point she came home with a migraine and had to go to bed. A couple weeks ago she was told she needed glasses and had a melt down from that which lasted a few days  All of her depression is new and was triggered by her old job and was never present prior to it. Now she is working what I would consider very basic jobs that you could do with a high school diploma and she is still struggling. We have two great kids and it is not an option for her to not work. I honestly feel like I now have another child that I am taking care of. Any ideas or suggestions? 
I've tried suicide , I  need to figure out why not complete. I take antidepressants, I find it impossible to get out of the feeling that I'm useless I don't enjoy anything,it's impossible for me to share my thoughts and feelings.I'm not going to do anything today ,  
Hello I have made a friend and I was lucky enough to meet her and hopefully help. She has been depressed and has gone to the doctors and been given drugs for it, Zoloft. Anyway that is not the problem I think I can help her with that easily.... The real problem is that she is addicted to drugs that are not good.... I dont know what they are yet but I think I have been able to push her to try to stop and I want to help as much as I can and give her a good plan of how to get off of them as easily as posible. Can someone please help me? And I am unable to get any offical help becuase of her situation. I realy want to help. 
I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to be here anymore. What's here for me? What am I on this earth for? To be alone forever? To struggle until I'm dead. I'm 24. Never been in a relationship. Depressed. Worry about everything, have bad anxiety, no friends, no job. Haven't had a job for 8 months now, have had one interview. One. Out of 35+. I'll never have a career. I'm afraid of life and I don't know what to do anymore  
Well he left me and took her on the holiday that I was supposed to be on. Whilst I'm stuck at home with depression taking my anti depressants and pain killers he's off with his child substitute. You've guessed it she 20 years younger and walked into my life. So whilst they are winging their way to The US of A he's gonna get a rude awakening upon touch down. No Cash, no cards. Shame really as she's after him for precisely that. Do I feel good - damn right I do.  
Hey  I'm Louis, I'm 15 years old and recently i have recently been down after reflecting on my life after the events of my dog passing away. along with my grandpa having a operation removing a tomour from his stomach. I smoke cannabis regularly and find it hard to resist when i have the chance to smoke it. All these events get worse as i see my dad about once every 3 months and believe that he is cheating on my mum as i saw texts on his phone. These events have really put me down and i just wanna know what will help?   
I am a 20 year old male with Aspergers syndrome and I don't know what to do or where to go about these feelings of utter dread and hopelessness that I feel. I feel like I am a collossal failure, I have watched everyone I know go on to do well for themselves, they have jobs that they are good at, aspirations they are achieving and I'm stuck in a hole that I can not seem to get out of, no matter what I do. I never had the best grades, nor a great deal of confidence in my abilities in anything as I constantly screw everything up, even simple things that seem to come natural to everyone else. I go to university but not to one of any note at all, one that is poorly run and fails to be intellectually challenging in any way. I chose to study a subject that I do not enjoy nor see much of a future in, because quite frankly I am damn idiot. I am stupid and I don't know why I am even alive, I am a waste of oxygen. Things have been looking up a little after I fell in love and got into a relationship with an amazing woman, she has very similar feelings to my own from time to time but she is so fantastically bright and has offers for post-graduate work and fantastic grades. She is everything that I am not and I don't feel like I deserve someone as magnificent as her. She deserves a real man and I do not feel that I am one at all, but a fool with no future. I want to be worthy of her, of my life, I have plans that I fully intend to implement in my future but they are not gurantees for success but I also do not want to rely on others for success, it wouldn't feel right. Everytime I have a plan to climb out of this hole, it just seems to turn into mud. I can't take this anymore. 
Hey everyone. I've been dealing with anxiety/depression for a while now. it mainly started when I was dealing with an eating disorder which caused me really bad anxiety. I feel like for the most part I've resolved my eating issues, despite my poor self image  anyway, for the past 6-7 months I've been dealing with constant nausea, which brought out my health anxiety to which the nausea kept becoming harder to bear. I've had numerous tests such as blood tests, stool tests, urine tests, x rays, ultrasounds and even an endoscopy, which came out all clear. I've gotten opinions from 5 doctors who have all put it down to my anxiety/depression. It's crazy how I didn't even realize I had anxiety and depression until I looked back at my life for the past two years and realized something wasn't right. Anyway, if anyone one has experienced depression/anxiety nausea and has gotten over it, please give me hope! I feel like it will never go away, and it's hard for me to believe that my brain could be making me feel nauseated!! ..I have very supportive friends and family but I still feel empty, sad, and physically ill  
My boyfriend and I have been together for over 8 years. We've lived together for most of the time and although we have some rocky spots I feel like we are good for each other. We are both in our mid twenties. Recently (over the past few months) I noticed him pulling away from me more than usual. He doesn't want to do anything outside of being home. I thought this whole time it was something I was doing and confronted him about it multiple times and he said he will work on it. He smokes marijuana most days which normally doesn't bother me much but he would say that's the reason he never wants to do anything and was trying to wean back off of it. We went to a wonderful fair yesterday and he seemed miserable the whole time. I practically had to drag him out of the house with an argument to get him to come. Today I got really frustrated and told him he is a closed book and that I wish he would communicate with me better. He finally broke down and said he's depressed. He thinks he's always been but right now is the worst it's ever been. He did tell me about 5 years ago he thought he might have depression but never talked about it again and seemed fine. He told me today that he loves me and I'm the most important thing to him but nothing in life makes him happy anymore. He said he doesn't know if we can continue in a relationship and try to make me happy when he doesn't even love himself. We both broke down crying and I asked if he wanted to break up. He said he can't take care of me and wants me happy and that if breaking up is what it takes then we should. I told him I love him and want to support and help him and that I believed in him and he should get help. He said he could barely talk to me about this and that seeing a therapist is out of the question and he needs space. He told me if he can't make me happy he can't be selfish and he wants me to be with someone who can make me happy. I told him he makes me happy and that we needed to focus on him and getting him better. He also told me that he didn't know what the future had in store for us and he wasn't sure if he wanted to marry me. Even though he has told me that we will get married several times in the past. We had a long conversation and I ended up leaving for most of the day so he could have time alone. I'm about to go back but this is all so new to me and I need help on how to continue forward.  
Hi all,  I'm 34 years old. I have been dignosed with depression & anxiety. Within this 9 months, I have had work, financial, health and marriage issues.   I'm in e-commerce. My work demand alot of my time and focus. I was hospitalise for liver infections. My boss ask me to go for a meeting a day after I went home after hospitalisation. His response to my marriage issue are to work harder and earn more money as to be stronger then problems. Since I join this company, I had not been laughing and talking as I used to. My boss is very successful but I feel are too commercialise. Or this is the market out there?   My wife and I going to be separated. I admit I had neglected her and my family. I was focusing a lot on my work, working 12-14 hours daily as to clear some debts. We had been married 5 years. I was doing relatively well in my business when we was married. Around two and a half year into our marriage, I got to close down my business as market demand is changing. And I occur some debts due to it.   I was a very confident, fearless and cheerful person in the past. I am now thinking of taking a break to heal my mental health but at the same time I am worried about my family expense. Eveything came crushing down. It's like standing in the middle of a four way cross-road. I dont know what choice to make, and what to do.   Can someone kindly please advise,  Many regards & thanks!

Hi everyone, so I am a 28 year old female. I have been battling with severe anxiety and depression for the majority of my adult life. I have a 4 year old son who is so sweet and. Amazing but after my pregnancy my life took a turn for the worst. My depression after my baby was born has gotten worse and worse over the years and now at an all time high. Yes I have cut myself but am NOT suicidal. I could never do it because I have my son and I understand the messed up situations that make life hard to deal with are temporary. Well besides the fact I just got diagnosed with genital herpes which I got from my partner of almost 4 years. (He raised my son since he was a few months old.) We don't k ow where it came from other than when we took a 6 no the break he received unprotected oral. Anyway that's a discussion for a different forum of this site. Finances have been hard and we are barely getting by let's just say there will be no Christmas. On top of that my relationship is rocky, I have no family, and I don't even want to be around my son anymore due to my depression and anxiety. I don't want him to see me like this and I snap at him because I'm so short tempered. I have been prescribed meds but they make me feel so high a few hours later. Doesn't matter what kind, Zoloft, celexa, prestiq, xanz I usually don't talk about my personal business but this site is all I have right now. I have no family and no real friends. Any support or advice is greatly appreciated. Even if you would like to share your story!   Xoxo  PS: I'm trying� 
I don't know what to do anymore. Had MH issues for last 14yrs. Three years into intensive treatment and nothing is working. I just give up. I've nothing to offer anyone, and nothing positive to bring to any situation. I only have two family members and we haven't seen each other or spoken for 15 years.. and I've no friends anymore. I don't even want any friends tbh. Too much effort. I've no interest in being alive anymore, I'm just a drain on NHS resources. Death is the best way out for me.

I am having extremely difficult time sleeping, i can't sleep during nights for the past 2 weeks, I am spacing out from my family completely and i feel empty non-stop. I am 20 years old, I was lonely since elementary school till this moment, the 1 friend i thought i have (since infant-hood) shows no interest to hangout with me or even a answer my messages on the phone.  I've also quit gaming recently, ive completely threw it out of my life which was also very hard and i don't know what to do to feel the emptiness inside me, i feel so lonely, no friends, so empty and sad, it pains me so much i feel like suiciding every day during the night when i lay in my bed daydreaming of all the ideal things i wished i had in my life.  the only thing kept me busy this far was watching Anime non-stop and drawing.  please help me 
Depression has quite literally taken everything from me, and feelings of despair and hopelessness dominate my life. Increasingly I am left asking myself 'If this is all my life is ever going to be, then what is the point of existing, because this is no life'.   A bit about me...  I'm a 20 year old male, currently at Uni. I have serious self-esteem issues, have been struggling with low moods since at least 16, mainly due to bad bullying at school and poor family relationships.   I have a lot of 'demons' and issues, and I won't go into them all here...  However.. I have abused alcohol for at least the past 18 months. It is now a problem I have under control. I turned to drink to combat severe loneliness and to try and block out thoughts and feelings which have plagued me for years. I knew it wouldn't work, and it doesn't. But it became a mechanism by which I could in a strange way escape. I'd often drink to the point of passing out, and as strange as it sounds this was almost a relief, because for that evening I didn't have to think about those dark thoughts. I appreciate in the long-term alcohol will only have made things worse. I can drink in moderation, and have tried to cut down my solo drinking sessions, but my dark thoughts persist.   I'm now at Uni and *should* be happy, but I'm not. In fact, these are the darkest days I have faced. I have no motivation left to do anything. I have exams over a period of the next month. If I pass them a miracle will have occurred. The truth is, my motivation has gone. I ask what I'm working towards when I live a life of such despair anyway. Aren't these supposed to be the best days of my life, if they are, what on earth have I to bother about?  I'm not sure whether this should be in the sexual health section - I've placed it here because depression is my main problem, and I believe it to be the main reason I am having the problems I am today.   I have suffered with questions over my sexuality, and am now fully accepting of the fact I am gay. This has been a big thing for me to conclude because much of the bullying at school was homophobic in nature, so I was almost conditioned to believe that coming to terms with that being my identity would prove those individuals right and be an admission that I was a lesser person. My dad is also a devout catholic, and I know the fact I am gay will always mean I am less of the son he wanted me to be, and I will always be a let-down to him in that regard.   However, I have no libido or sex drive and haven't done for about six months at least. I have stopped  masturbating, and can't remember the last time I had a proper erection. I attribute this to depression, and a general loss of hope and happiness. Of course though, it in turn has become a factor in the way I am feeling.   To cut a long story short... I have always had very low confidence, so asking people to do things with me has always been a big challenge, as have gaining friendships. The thought of a relationship has been terrifying. Mainly because, at around 14 I told myself that no one would ever be attracted to me or love me, so I might as well give up hope it would happen. I finally plucked up the courage to ask a guy I like out for a drink. I thought he might like me in that way, but wasn't sure.  Anyway.. He came back to my place and wanted to have sex which I was comfortable about because I do feel attraction towards him - in fact the first time I have been properly attracted to anyone, however, I could not get an erection, and was therefore unable to perform. In turn, he took that as a rejection and that's another friendship I can put into the bin and another blow to my confidence.    As such, I feel I will never be able to pursue a relationship and will never be able to have anyone in my life. I am pretty much again resigned to the fact I will never have a significant other and will always be alone.   My problems are deep rooted, and there are many of them. I just don't see things ever getting any better and don't know what to do. I was on antidepressants (citalopram) the side effects were horrendous and I have never thought about suicide more than when I was on them. I came off them myself. At first I felt 'normal' (lack of suicidal thoughts), however, my mood is becoming ever darker.   I am getting counselling through my uni, however, this is limited to just 6 sessions, and it's clear that nothing is going to be resolved in that time (2 sessions to go)  I've lost a stone in the past 3 months, and have lost my appetite completely. I can go for days without eating properly, and have to force myself to eat when I do.   Is there any hope, and am I ever going to feel better, because I can't go on like this any longer. 
Just joined. Was looking for a site where I could hopefully come across people who can identify with me. That alone feeling, can't talk to anyone. Would be nice to come into contact with people who understand.   
Hi, I started my first year at Uni in September, since then my life has been on a downward spiral. I am already a year behind as I failied my exams so had ot resit a year at school. At first I didnt enjoy Uni as I couldnt find anyone I clicked with or that went out and had a good time. I have felt very isolated and alone sitting in my room all by myself, at first my boyfriend and family were always there for me and came to visit so that every week I had something to look forward to. Then one day out of the blue my boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me, he was my best friend and absolute everything, I have never loved or cared for a person like him. He is in second year at a different Uni and basically just wants to be a typical single boy with no cares. This breaks my heart to hear him say and to see him getting close with other girls. I have looked into dropping out of Uni however to my parents that woud make me a real dissappointment and a waste of money and honestly im not even sure what I would do. Slowly over the pst two and a half months I have got to the point where I dont even know what im living for anymore. I have no career prospects, no real future, I cant sleep and I just feele like im hvaing to stop myself from breaking down every second. Since being home for Christmas ive felt exactly the same, I hate social situations becasue no matter how hard I try I cant seem to force myself to have fun. I have also found that I get very anxious when I go somewhere I once went with my ex and it feels like my heart is racing and I dont know what to do. My fmaily have become very short dempered with me and get very angry when im feeling low. I could go back to Uni but I hate it there and it makes me feel vert low or I stay at home where noone wants me to be becasue they say im miserable. I try so hard to put on a smie etc but inside im hurting so badly. I feel like the pain wont go away and I just want some release! I dont understand what the point in being here is, I cant talk to anyone as noone understands. I have nothing great in my future so is there even a point?

Hello there :D I am a 22 -year- old male , i don't know where to start because i came here all of a sudden as i found this site by luck during an internet surf and that's why i didn't prepare what i have to say in detail but my problem is that i am a kind of nerd , i have spent most of my life studying and now i am in the school of medicine and my social life have always been empty , even during my childhood i didn't get as much of it as my other colleagues , but that didn't bother me because i had a few friends (3 to be accurate) and i have spent much time with them having fun and so on but there is one thing that i have never experienced which is romantic life and relationship with girls throughout my entire short life , i was in a boys-only school (a catholic school) although i am not christian but let's not stray away from the main point here , the thing is , i haven't really had any kind of experience with girls in general , to the extent that i have never even hand shaked a girl because i am in a middle eastern country , during my teenage i was mainly studying and playing online games and nothing more , and even when i tried to approach a girl i failed due to lack of experience , during high school i went on a study spree that lasted for 2 years to get high marks to enroll in a medical school and these 2 years were like a black hole in my social life in general , i became so fat during this period that i did hit the 116 mark on the scale (by kilograms and not lbs) , but i went to a nearby gym and now i am 80 and looking fit , but the problem is still there and it actually started to bother me because during this period of my life i feel like i need this new experience , i started to be much much much less productive due to the fact that i always feel like i miss something in my life , lack of sociability was never a problem for me because i am successful in making few good friends that i am satisfied with but the lack of romantic life and social life with girls started to make me feel uneasy , i don't think anyone will understand this unless he lived in the middle east for some time , i have never touched a girl , never kissed one , never talked to one until i joined the college and the talks are always short and academic , never got in a relationship with one , what made me feel so bad recently is that i had a crush on a girl and tried to approach her throughout a period of 3 years but never had the courage nor the good luck to start a conversation , recently she has got engaged and i didn't even tell her despite the fact that i wanted to , that made me feel bad , and it made me feel like i am in a desperate need to tell someone about this bad experience just to get some reassurance or so , i am not even sure if that is normal or overreacting but that doesn't matter because i feel bad myself , even if my depression or saddness is an overreaction it still bothers me and i want it to be fixed , and now i started to have sexual fantasies just imagining myself touching a girl i love , not perverted fantasies , being consumed by the need of romance and being less productive and day dreaming about our most basic needs , even in psychology it is categorised as a basic instinct , i tried to talk to someone about this and all his answer was "just wait" , ok i am waiting , waiting my entire life but i am not feeling well about it , and i think the situation that triggered this is that i tried to approach a girl for so long that she got engaged and i am still here doing nothing but complain , it makes me feel like a sissy boy who can't get over his problems but i feel lonely although i am surrounded by my close friends which are few and all of them are males , i want a new kind of relationship that i lacked my entire life and now this deprivation started to knock my door and slam me to the ground and consume me in all aspects , i admit that i want to kiss a girl , touch her , love her , i want to experience these things that i lack , some people may not welcome this idea but i am facing this need within myself , every time i sleep i imagine myself walking with someone i love across the streets or kissing each other or even having sex and i really feel that it is desperate and shameful to fantasize over these basic things , that's why i came here with fake name and information , because i want to share things like this without being personally accused of being psycho , perverted , not a grown up and so on , i am an INFP type of personality if that's relevant here , just mentioning it , i know i have been repetitive and i know that my language is not very good so i apologize that i stretched this confession to the extent of being boring but it was important for me to write until my hands get sore to make sure i stated everything :D 
I have suffered from depression on and off for over 25 years & am currently going through a terrible depression & I cannot see any way out of it this time. My world has caved in & I cannot cope anymore & there only seems to be one answer to this torture I am going through.  i am very lonely, only have 2 proper friends (who are both ex-partners) but they are both in long term relationships & don't really have time for me. I am long term unemployed because of my mental health problems, but to try to help my mental state I walk a couple of dogs every day & have made acquaintances with a group of people & I poured my heart out to them yesterday. They all made sympathetic noises, listened to me & said I mustn't end my life. But nobody knows what I am going through or the despair I am feeling.   Short story - I am a 55 year old gay woman, been single for 18 years after having made the decision I would never find anybody & gave up trying to find a partner. Out of the blue 12 months ago I fell in love with an attractive, caring, kind, gentle, woman but unfortunately there was no way I could tell her & there was a 0% chance that she would feel the same. This woman was my wonderful GP, who I could tell anything to - except this. I had a number of consultations during this year, each time counting down the hours until I could see her again. I was well aware that I had a problem and had a number of counselling sessions to talk this through & try to understand why this had happened and was continuing to happen even though I knew it could never be.  I had an appointment with her earlier this week & she told me that my current therapist had told her all about my feelings. She said it didn't bother her but it meant that she had unknowingly been compromising my care & wouldn't be able to see me anymore, but in any event she was leaving my surgery in 3 weeks & moving hundreds of miles away. At that moment my world caved in.   On on top of that, the only family I have are moving away from the area in 2 days & I will be here all alone.  I'm scared & keep fighting feelings of panic. I'm hardly eating or drinking & am starting to feel physically ill. I can't sleep & altho I did ask her, the GP wouldn't give me any sleeping pills because she was worried what I may use them for.   I don't know how to get through all of this & I do think that I would be better off out of this world. 
Hi all,  I've hit another rough patch and looking for advice for others in a similar situation.  My condition seems to comprise:  40% low mood 30% anxiety 30% frustration and anger (sometimes over small things like losing a sock or a bit of traffic).  I've been this way on and off for 3 years now mainly due to:  - Lack of relationship  - Isolation - close circle all marrried with kids - Self-employed challenges / isolation  - Trying to perfect everything!  What's worked for you?   I've taken Prozac and citalopram in the past and may need to take something again (currently taking very small does of mirtazapiene for sleep.  I've had therapy in the past (private and NHS) which helped but NHS was only 5 sessions and private is expensive.  I know no two mental health conditions are the same but would appreciate any advice. 
Hi all  I'm new to this forum but thought I'd seek some help as its very much needed.  I'm a 29 year old male, an have not really been myself properly since 2008.. Every year I go through a low mood an then get so tired. I was prescribed anti depressants (citropram 20mg) then it went up to 40mg at certain points. Every time I have a change in my life then I seem to go strange whether it be in work or home life, well I think it's to do with change..  I used to love work and work all hours an travel to different countries & my work ethic was brilliant but my confidence has completely gone in everything I do and it's been like this for nearly 6 months now.  Last year was a complete mash up for me, my wife told me she didn't love me anymore so we split & sold our house and I moved from Wales to England to live with my friend. We were married for 4 years and together 8'years. I think my bouts of depression did not help our relationship as sometimes I was happy but most of the time had no energy and was down. She did not like the idea of anti depressants and rather me sort out the cause of it..I did do counselling but never helped.  Also For many years (14 in total) I've suffered with gambling addiction as well, would never be a point where we had no money as both were in very well paid jobs but of course that did not help the relationship.  Anyway since we have split up I've constantly been in this low mood and depressed an few occasions just thinking of ending it all, so in November the doctor changed my tablets to mirtazapine 15mg and oh god... I took the first tablet on the Wednesday,slept all day on the Thursday an by the Friday I was unstoppable... Was in the gym, was not scared of any work, was cooking and felt so focused... Was dancing to Xmas songs around the house.. I felt alive. So much energy.... Counsellor was pleased, I was doing all my things to do list each day and everything was clear... Like my brain had opened the flood gates. Unfortunately this only lasted a week and a half and then I was back to my grumpy self with no energy again... Had points was feeling suicidal again. The phycaitrist doubled the dosage then but 5-6 weeks gone by an I was feeling nothing.. No motivation..no energy,,,no life in me. I decided to come off all tablets over the Xmas period by reducing the dosage over the weeks so by new year I was completely off them.   Since the new year I've not been on any tablets, not gambled at all and have been on a 6 week course for depression/anxiety and have not drank any alcohol at all...joined a gym an eat healthily but I'm constantly tired.. The doctors signed me off over Xmas but I chose to take my holidays instead as I do not like being off work ill but when I went back on the 7th Jan I could not face it... I was in physical pain and have been signed off since with low mood. I just don't understand any of this.. I'm trying all sorts, courses, relaxation tapes... Exercise, I've spent about £150 on viatamins like omega 3 oils and magnesium. EPA an DHA are supposed to be vital for depression and bi-polar so I've made sure the omega 3 is high in that. Also now drinking herbal tea. If someone said sit on your head for 3 hours a day I would!   I've seen a private doctor and she's put it down to low self esteem an confidence...and the gambling.  My head tells me everyday. Every hour "you're useless" "life is not worth living" " you are stupid", "you're going to lose your job and never get another one" etc  I've had these inner voices for so long now that they are just built into me. I used to want a family but now dead against having kids as insult not want them to go through these horrible thoughts and feelings.  There are so many people out there with much less then me and they cope but I'm just constantly worrying and hate life... And exhausted all then time. Even though I've got no money issues, still have my job but off sick. I feel selfish for being like this but just can't get out of it.  Was asked to go way this weekend, I agreed yesterday but the didn't sleep all night as was worried and then had stomach pains this morning so I cancelled going as I did not want to be grumpy and spoil my friends holiday.  Doctor prescribed dexetine today but so many bad reviews... Do I go back on tablets or anything else to try?? I've got a lot more to add but there's just no point adding it....  Any ideas welcome as I'm losing the will to live......  Sorry for such a long message.  R x 
I have just passed two months on 20mg fluoxetine per day. Initially like most people taking it I felt worse at first. That improved, but I cannot with hand on heart say that I feel any better now than before I started taking it.  âIs it possible that it is still early days or should I think about going back to the doctors and saying they are just not working.    
So I've had trauma induced depression most of my life. Since my teens at least. This let to huge amounts of addiction, many forms of addiction, self harm, life being ruined completely by losing all my money,my friends and family, my job. Basically to the point where it nearly took my life.   Recently I've managed to make theoretical progrsss. I say theoretical cos i got work, overcame my addictions and became stable enough to live alone. Basically i could not eat or wash Before. However, in spite of all of this I've still not been happy. I would say I'm depresed, i don't really know for sure. I assume it's depression as i don't enjoy things and think about suicide.   Anyway the other day, kindof out of the blue i cut myself again. To the point i needed emergency treatment and so on. Since then I'm feeling awful and basically thinking about ending it. Strangely i don't feel like going back to my addictions. I can't explain that. You would think i would naturally return to that.   I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow but ithink it won't go well. I'm pretty angry. And i often take it out on people. And i don't have that many people who care for me. I don't have a clue what to do. Hospital is out of the question, and i can't be forced, it's extremely hard to be forced into hospital here so i won't go.  Medication doesn't work  Therapy, talking doesn't work  Tried doing all the getting out there, exercise, hobbies that didn't work.   So am i a case of untreatable whatever? To be honest that's what I've been thinking for a while and so it's very likely I'll take the get out clause at some point.   I always thought that no matter how bad u get, there would always be another stronger drug, or a new thing or whatever. But i can't deal with another case of keep going.  
ok so here goes....writing out my feelings for you all.  i feel rubbish, worthless, useless and very low. I dont have anything to smile about. The positive things in life have hindrences that make matters worse. Im consumed with suicidal thoughts and self harming because thats what i deserve except i cant carry them out for fear of failure and getting caught and ending up in some nut house. My partner would split up with me and id be alone and that would make me worse.   i cant go get help with it as im ashamed to admit it. The whole thing would stop me from working. work is the only positive right now and i need that but id get sent home straight away with my job.   my family aint approchable, always have something else more pressing to worry about.   i dont have many of friends, most havent got the time to speak so i just sit here in a constant whirlwind of suicidal thoughts. its like im drowning and everyone around me is breathing. they are fine and im just looking at myself for the failure i am.   
We're obviously all in these forums to be there for each other and help each other out in difficult times that we all are dealing with or have dealt with in the past.  My question to everyone is do you think it is good or bad to post in here when you have a problem or difficult times. I seem to fall in the same trap in a lot of places online whenever I feel down or I'm having a tough day that I end up posting about it and it becomes an endless cycle of looking for reassurance all the time which I've come to think makes things worse because I do it over and over instead of just dealing with problems on my own. I know these forums definitely have there place but I think they can also be detrimental to us getting better unfortunately.  Just wanted to see what some different opinions of some of the people who actually know what it feels like to go through depression and anxiety everyday like myself. Thanks for any info or reply in advance! 
I have had depression for many years now which resulted in me becoming alcohol dependent. i am clean now so ready to tackle depression my mood had lifted i was sleeping and eating quite well. Went to Dr they recommended sertraline 50mg was ok apart from i went back to not sleeping my IBS flared up and for some reason i need to pee constantly and sometines not much comes out (dont knowif these connected) went for my 2 week review ( I know it can take a month + to kick in but was prepared to persevere!) Doctor was a bit abrupt. Mentioned the not sleeping well again ( had to use OTC stuff to go to sleep) so he said stop sertraline and go on amitrpteline 10mg increase to 20mg if need be) i was on 10mg previously for ibs and it didnt get me to sleep but i did sleep better. But i think this is a low dose for depression and pharacist agreed..... last time i was on sertraline i was on amitrpteline also........ he said now im not drinking if i sleep that might be enough? What do people think? Thank you 
Hello, I have always struggled with anxiety, but the past 2 weeks I have suddenly found myself totally spiraled downward. 3 weeks into citalopram my doctor and I decided to come of it bc of the side effects. I've been off for just 3 days, I am at least sleeping again but I have barely eaten in almost two eels and feeling more low than ever. I feel so emotionally disconnected from myself and everyone else and it freaks me out. I have a beautiful 3 year old son and wonderful husband and I just wish I could feel anything again and not feel like I'm just going through the motions. Please, anyone kind words that I will feel connected again and tips, I've just begun seeing a therapist, but only one session in so far. It carries over into my daily routines, and I just feel so disconnected. I've had a lot happen in my life especially this past year, is this my body just protecting itself? How do I get my sanity back? I want to feel happy, or sad, or anything! ��� 
This morning when I woke up, it felt like there was silent war in my head. It's almost impossible to put into words but I'll try.   I know I could have sat up, stood up, rolled over if I wanted. But it's more complex than that. Just because I could have doesn't mean it was easy to make it happen. It was like my body had all it's will defeated. It was not a muscular problem, not even a nervous problem far as I could tell. It was my will, by extension my psyche. I felt so burdened, so heavy. I occasionally twitched my toes, inhaled deeply, or whimpered, but that was about it. I did not open my eyes. There was no area which I felt any acute physical pain in. I wanted to fight this feeling, but I lacked the WILL.   I guess it's like when you're in a situation where you want to tell the truth but you can't. You know you can, you know you just have to open your mouth and speak the words on your mind, but it's so difficult that you stay silent.   That's actually how I felt about moving my body. I really wanted to get up, to even roll over and look at my phone, ANYTHING, but I was blocked.   Such an awful feeling!!! When I finally did get up I felt so much rage. I am extremely irritable today. But I know that's only one layer. Underneath all that rage I feel incredibly weak and powerless. And just plain sad.   Who else experiences this? I'm depressed, with likely borderline personality disorder, and take 50mg of Sertraline by the way.  
I have been going through a lot. I am 15 years old and have had anxiety for a while now. Lately though I have been feeling empty and emotionless. I wish that I could smile again, be happy, and I even miss being able to cry. Sometimes I feel like I should just end it but I don't want to I just want to be myself again. I really don't feel close to my family. Everything irritates me. I lock myself up in my room when I can. I feel no motivation to do anything. Stuff that I used to enjoy a lot like hanging out with friends now require great motivation for me to even try to do. I see a therapist every two weeks but nothing is really changing. Sometimes I feel there is no hope for me and worry that I will be like this for the rest of my life. Right now I just want to find ways on how to change this and be me again. Anything will help. Thanks 
I've been on anti-depressants for the majority of my life now (17 years). For the first 15 years I was on prozac. Love it, did it's job wonderfully. I switched 2 years ago to Trintellix as I wasn't feeling as great as I had been previously on my prozac. Now I am questioning if I made the right decision - I am wondering and going through in my mind, if perhaps I was just in a 'funk', a low and knee-jerk reacted? The Trintellix has been okay.. not great. At first it seemed to do the job, but now I feel it not so much. We have played around with the doseage and I don't know.. I feel like perhaps I should go back to prozac. When I started prozac way way back, I didn't have any negative symptoms... I am worried if I was after speaking with my doctor, to go back on prozac, what the chances are that there may be symptoms/sideaffects that I didn't have the first time.   Anyways.. I will stop  the rambling. Just curious if anyone else has ever had a similar experience and if so, what was the outcome.   Thanks!

hello, to start i'm new to the forums and just looking for advice or something to settle my terrible worries about this. i've been diagnosed with depression and been off work for 3 years with it (yes its severe.) i'm on a very slow road to recovery and i've been getting weekily therapy with a mental health team for 2 years now.  as of reccent (just this week) i've been in one of my worst depressive states and extremely low and i've been sleeping for 12+ hours each day however the last 3 days i've suddenly woken by my own body violenty shaking/shivering(?) this has happened after very strange/upsetting/uncomfortable dreams (one of which involved me throwing up blood before i suddenly woke.)  it feels and looks similar to a seizure and i'm uncontrollably shaking to the point where i can barely pick up a glass of water and i struggle to speak. it takes about 5-10 minutes to completely calm down but its very scary (especially when you have anxiety over dying/death and immedietly think something is extremely wrong with you.)  i also currently have gallstones and i'm on a waiting list for an operation to get my gallbladder removed and i'm also very worried it is something to do with this. told my mum and she has told me to eat sugars as she thinks the gallbladder diet that i've been on for 4 months could have made my blood sugar levels drop. the diet is extremely low fat, i'm not eating any meals/snacks above 15g of fat but im still eating 3 meals a day as well as low fat snacks such as tea biscuits and low fat crisps. i ended up having tea with a table spoon of honey and sugar and some toast with honey too but i've still felt really dizzy and slightly confused all day.  i just really want some advice as to where to go/who to see. if its urgent or not and if anyone else suffers from this. im scared to sleep because the shaking is so violet is actually leaves my arms sore. please help!!! thank you !! 
I've had bouts of anxiety before, but I've been recently unwell (food poisoning) I'm getting over that..however I'm left with serve anxiety and keep getting these terrible cold sweats...anyone else experienced this ?  
I never thought it would get this bad but I feel like don't have any other options.  I guess I'll start from the beginning.  I just turned 25. About 5 months ago I was very unhappy. But I had somethings that I could use to keep me going. I liked things like making music on my computer and I had a girlfriend that I thought was amazing. Eventually it came to a stop when both lost my grandmother and my girlfriend disappeared. Combined with the stress of having to take care of myself and a very stressful job I had a very bad panic attack while smoking.  I smoked everyday. The past 5 years really. It became who I was and everything from my social media to my music was all about it. After it left me cause of me being afraid to do it again I started going down hill. I got extremely addicted to cigarettes and I lost my passion to do anything. I eventually had to move out of my house and stay with my granddad because I couldn't handle it anymore. I stopped talking to people. I stopped listening to music because it either reminds me that I'm alone or the fact that I can't find the passion to do it anymore. This is the thing that kills me the most because music was the only thing I went to in these dark times.   Currently I'm living with my granddad and he thinks I'm crazy because I don't talk anymore. I can't. I've lost all my confidence and self esteem because I don't know who I am anymore. I'm in a constant battle with my mind and my negative thoughts. It's made it so I can't concentrate or remember things at work. And hanging out with my friends is so hard for me because I look at them and wish I could go back to being normal. I feel like I'm losing them one by one and I can't seem to try and do something about it.   Everyday I wake up and feel like I'm in a nightmare. I can't get up in the morning unless I force myself to and when I finally do I never have anything to occupy my time. Smoking was such a huge part of it I really don't know how to live normally.   I feel like this is a situation I can't get out of. I can't make goals for myself because when I do I feel like they won't matter in the end. I can't get back social because I've lost myself and I'm going to just end up awkward or weird trying to fit back in. I feel horrible because so many people have worse situations and I can't seem to be happy for what I have. But I'm at a point now that taking a shower in the morning feels like a something I can't do.   I feel like eventually I'm going to have to end the suffering. I'm on bupropion 150 mg and I'm on my 7th day. Hoping that it can at least stop me for constantly downing myself. I don't know why I'm putting all this here or what can help but I guess I just needed to vent it out. I feel like I'm overreacting and it's just knocking me down lower. But I don't know what to do. 
I never feel good.   I'm always complaining about something.  Everyday it's something different.  A headache, back ache, heartburn, I mean I don't know if it's all in my head or am I crazy?  I'm so tired all the time.  I know my stress level is incredibly high.  I'm not sure what I'm trying to say.    
So I was diagnosed over a year ago now, 20mg of Citalopram once daily. I don't spend hours every night trying to get to sleep now. I'm no longer drinking a bottle of wine a day. I've gained a massive amount of weight because I'm eating now but something has changed recently.   Over the last few months I started to feel more numb each day. I can't feel happy/excited/sad. I go to work and do my job every day. If I do decide to drink I just can't stop at one. My weight gain disgusts me, I have no sex drive because I repulse myself so much. I feel bad for the boyfriend.   I don't see a future, I have access to dangerous drugs at work and although I haven't yet, I have considered taking some and getting absolutely sh*t faced so I can stop feeling like this. I drunkingly text my boyfriend the other night telling him outright that I don't want to live anymore and I just feel ashamed. I don't want him to see me as being weak. I feel weak, I want to get excited about life but I feel stuck. Nothing is moving, I'm exhausted and do not have the energy to change anything.   I just needed to rant, I could go on but I shan't.  
Anyone who knows me I've been going through the wringer lately. Had a very stressful week, had  respiratory tests done, got a machine to test my breathing morning and night for a week, good news my second bowel test was clear, yipee!!!!. Had 3 monthly appointment with psychiatrist actually went well felt as if she listened this time and lasted an hour, told her more stuff has come to light following my BP assessment not that it would make a difference I don;t think but she will contact the Dr that completed this. It's stuff I need to download to deal with it. Next day the long travel for OHS assessment had been a wake since 5 am, self harmed on the bus as getting very up tight and anxious stupid or what, got in a panic as got lost and couldn't find the street in the city where the building was, did find it in the end. Panicked because the city was busy, felt trapped in a few shops, managed not to cry. Appointment went well the Dr remembered me from last time as I frightened him being so aggressive, he said he had noticed improvements and I know what;s going on , his report he said will hopefully protect me at work while I am still trying to sort my head out without them sacking me, I think my work are quite concerned as I walked out a few weeks ago and took more meds than i should of not enough to do myself in but enough to make me shot away as they hadn;t put in place support as the both members of staff I was suppose to go to were off. Anyway suggestions are reduce my hours for at least 8-12 weeks, more support and structure, further assessment after that. Very unsure as can;t think how this will work, contacted union rep who has been involved since I went off over 2 years ago. told you it will be a muddle. got my eyes tested they are ok but panicked again in the shopping centre as too busy. 70 mile drive home was good so good that I got high and a rush from its speeding and it was dark it felt good!!, delivered shopping that I was asked to get from a work colleague who said I was a different person she hadn't seen. I was flying... Later got a text from another friend who is struggling with the news about the abuse to young footballers as it is bringing memories back to him (not being a footballer though) tried to answer his text suggesting to talk to gP/Samaritians/family or even write it down as he doesn't wnat to talk about it this is the 3rd time he has text me about this. Find it hard to help did offer to listen but couldn't give any advice  As have my own problems(wouldn;t talk to him as don;t trust him as he tends to drink too much in company loose tongue), bought in more memories to me ended up driving very recklessly made myself park up before I crashed and rang samaritians talked through his texts, mentioned my past changed the subject managed to calm down, talked again about me but avoided a lot of answers as not ready to talk about it. good walk out with a friend on Saturday, did fall over in the mud even laughed. Still only sleeping in two hour slots, took diazepam again to try and relax, today at work dreaded it, talked ot my line manager about last week he said too busy to look into yet plus he is off later this week. He is very stressed to as he is temp manager or an I making excuses for him, he is getting paid extra money. got my copy of the report, went to exercise class tonight after ended sat by the sea, high tide deep enough to jump off the car park, but going to g/kids school xmas show on Thursday then got to keep going as my sister is coming to stay so got to do housework so ended going for a good drive in the dark. Now home getting drunk cos i can and just updating you all.  Said it would be a mess like me. Thanks for reading if you get to the end. x 
No one understands how hideous depression is. I push myself every single day to get the house cleaned since I'm not working anymore. Today is not one of my better days. Just sitting here in the silence and crying. I just wanna curl up in a ball and hide from the world. But I know I can't do that.   I have a mound of housework to do. I have to clean out the refrigerator because something sticky spilled ad it's all over the bottom shelf. I have pots and pans that need to be washed. There isn't even any room in the sink. There's laundry that needs to be folded and put away. I need to run a load of towels, also. I need to dust and vacuum. I'm sitting here looking at the mess in the living room. Clothes, socks, my coat, etc... Needs to be tidyed up. And after all that I need to take a shower.  My husband keeps "reminding" me that this stuff needs to be done. His clothes for work are still in the dryer. He's sick of looking at the mess on the bottom shelf of the fridge. I've already had to go down and push the slush off the steps in case the landlady shows up.  In the last few weeks I have gotten so low that I've gotten suicidal. I mentioned it to my husband, but he just got annoyed. Why would I do this now when he has enough to worry about. Gee... I dunno... maybe because I'm so depressed and so fed up that I really don't want to be alive. I'm tired of life. I've had enough. I can't find a job. I can't get the ambition to clean. Hubby's under stress because he's not used to being the sole provider. I'm the one who always worked. He would just have some seasonal work where he would work for maybe 4-6 weeks in the summer. He has a temp job now and he's hoping that they'll hire him on, but he hates the work and doesn't much care for the work environment either.  And oh..did I mention that my husband is a "dry addict" and "periodic alcoholic"? So I have to deal with the guilt that all this stress may push him into another binge. He comes home at night and spends 2 1/2 hrs drinking beer. He doesn't get drunk. He's got a high tolerance. But still... something he hasn't done in a very long time. He buys a 12-pk (bottles) every other day.   so yeah... my life sucks big time. Luckily it's only 1pm here and I have until 7:30 tonight to get everything done.  
As it says in the title I'm really struggling I'm feeling so depressed and anxious feeling very detached from my self and reality I don't seem to have any control over my thoughts my mind is overrun with constant thoughts of dying on top of all this i have a gambling problem today I lost all my money in the betting shop â¬900 I had for Christmas to buy my family gifts and some new clothes for my self now u don't what I'm going to do.   ��� I don't expect people to feel sorry me because I was stupid enough to go in to the bookie's and lose all my money but I would appreciate someone to talk with about my other problems ����� 
Has anyone else experienced this? A marijuana edible triggered some very serious depression and out of control anxiety/fear/paranoia/borderline delusion a couple years back and while it has slowly become less acute and more generalized and easy to handle, recently I just feel a lot less of everything. Like im not really anxious and only somewhat depressed. Overall its way better than ive been but its weird. Like i just feel very little. Its like, on the surface Im in relatively decent moods and I get excited about things and sad about others like a healthy person would but theres just this overarching sense of numbness. Like in the broader sense of all this there's no real meaning or purpose to be found. Its kind of like being lost or out of place. 
Ugh feel so drained and tired of almost everything at the moment, the smallest little thing irritates me!  I am not sleeping very well due to chronic back pain, i am taking meds but this time of year is the hardest for me!     
Hello. For the last 2 years I've suffered with low mood, anxiety and/or depression. I have most things in life that make you happy. I have a house and a job and a lovely wife I married last year.  So why am I suffering?    My main symptoms are chest discomfort which moves around from day to day. Some days it's severe and in a particular area then it's like over night it moves somewhere else. It has never woken me up at night and with tests done it's excluded heart problems  Next is a what I call over active gut. Most of the last 2 years I've had loose stools. Not diahorea but some days are worse then others. Also my gut continues to make noises Most of the time It's worse when I have no appetite.  I've been on mirtazapine 30mg for the last year but I don't think they have done much to help.  I've now started on sertraline 50mg a few days ago and they have made me feel awful. No appetite at all and make me feel really sick. I'm not sleeping well and have no get up and go which was the problem for the last 2 years.   I worry I have something seriously wrong with me. Everytime I think I know what's up with me I look it up and convince myself that's what is up.  It makes me feel better for a while but never lasts.   The last few months I've tried to convince myself there is nothing wrong with me. That these feelings I have are just anxiety but I can't get rid of them.   Any help would be appreciated in finding out what is wrong 
i got started on a low dose (10mg) of fluoxetine a week ago. i haven't experienced much physical symptoms besides the occasional headache or stomach pain but im not worried about those. i know it takes awhile for antidepressants to start working but I'm having some worrisome effects. i have increased suicidal thoughts (they got really bad earlier today) and i feel lower than ever. i get irritated so easily and i just feel so terrible. i know that it can have these effects sometimes but is this something i should be concerned about?  
I heard the other day than an ex landlord of my local pub had died of lung cancer.  He was one year older than me at 63.  After the shock of hearing the news my first thought was 'lucky man'.  And I wish it had been me.  It shocked me to the core to think that as it came out of the blue when I am not especially depressed.   It got me thinking.  He had a loving partner,  kids and everything to live for whereas I have nothing.  I would have swapped if I could.   Not looking for meds/counselling advice but just other people thoughts.   Does it mean I am depressed without realising it?  And how can that be?  I haven't though beyond that as I can't get past my gut reaction.      
Please read my story and I would be so grateful of some advice and support. I've recently slipped into depression after a major life transition. I hope I don't sound too ungrateful, because my situation may sound absolutely idyllic. I realise that people have far, far worse problems in life. But I still feel depressed. I had it all - I was in an extremely well paid job at the top of my career, with a short commute and reasonable hours, excellent working conditions, a gorgeous little house in London. But I wasn't happy. I was constantly stressed by office politics that left me drained all the time. And I have always struggled to feel engaged at work. I had no energy left to do the things I really enjoy - photography, the outdoors and travel. It didn't help that the people I worked with weren't sociable, our neighbours downright unfriendly. We had no relatives nearby, and my wife and I have no kids. Almost all my old friends moved away from London long ago, and London demographics have changed so much in the past few years, I feel like a stranger there now despite living there over 20 years.  I am fortunate that, having been in a well paid job, with simple needs and no kids, I had enough money to retire in my late 40's. I also had built up a decent little business selling my photos online, and I could find consultancy work if the wheel came off.  So this year I quit my job with no regrets. We thought we would move out of London to a lovely house somewhere near Henley, work on the photography, and lead the "good life." Bliss!  Then it all went pear shaped. My wife's father died and she decided she wanted her mum to come live with us. My wife was adamant we needed a huge place to accommodate us. That limited our options but I went along with it. We ended up buying an old farmhouse further out in a very rural area. It's not the sort of thing I would have even considered, but again, I went along with it. The house is certainly "impressive", but it's a complete fixer-upper and as soon as we moved in I regretted it. It needs much, much more work than I anticipated, it's very isolated apart from a few houses nearby, yet the road is much busier than I realised, and every lorry that thunders past just feet from our windows, shatters any illusion I had of an "idyllic" country lifestyle. I miss pavements and street lights, and having coffee shops and restaurants at the end of the road. And I think we actually enjoyed nicer countryside living on the edge of the green belt in London.   I quickly became utterly depressed. If ever there was proof that money can't buy happiness, then I am it. I struggle to face every day. I am desperately homesick and I've thought of moving back to London, but in truth I can't replace our little house that I loved so much. I renovated it all myself and it really was the perfect house and even the estate agents said so.  I even want to go back to work for sanity's sake. But we're now so far from London it would be a really tough commute. I thought if I regretted leaving work I could do consulting work from home. But that doesn't get me out of the house so I'm not sure it will help. And my wife and her mum both love it here. The neighbours are very friendly. My wife and her mum aren't bothered by the passing cars so for them it is really peaceful here. For me, it feels like my old life has ended and I am doomed to spending the next twenty years in a house I hate, miles from anywhere that inspires me, and with no job to get away from it all. I really don't know what to do, how to settle, how to get into a routine. I am not productive and struggling to work on the house because every time we sink money into it, it feels like one more nail in the coffin.  I'm just getting more and more down. Haven't done any photography either. London awash with things to photograph. Now I'm surrounded by fields. I know that both London and Oxford are reachable but I feel so disconnected. After quitting my job and moving house I don't know who I am anymore, or what I am doing here. I practically had an anxiety attack when I had to answer the "occupation" question on a form. I struggle to get out of bed every morning and waste half the day procrastinating. It's putting a real strain on our marriage too as my wife is left picking up the pieces.  I guess I'm just looking for some advice... please help!   
Does anyone else go dizzy when concentrating, this has started happening to me for the passed few weeks now 
Quite alot lately ive been thinking about my suicide (really every second im not distacted by something), ive been picturing my funeral, my parents and siblings crying as im lowered into the ground, sounds terrible but thats just what im thinking. I still havnt seen a doctor or therapist, Just hasnt happened because i dont have the motivation to even leave my room. I have tried to cry but i really cant feel emotion, my family are really noticing that. Im always hoping to be bedriden by some accident or sickness, though i would feel bad for the person made to look after me. Schools over for now so i have zero distraction from these thoughts except video games which i know are not good for me and im wasting my life, as im constantly told, but if i didnt have them i would have stepped into traffic years ago, ive been feeling like this as long as i remember and my parents dont think its that big of a deal because i havnt even scratched the surface when explaining how i feel. Sorry for this, i know that someone will say you just have to talk to someone but i would never tell full truths and get wronly diagnosed and i would tell a counciler, if thay asked how i was doing, that i was better when im not. Thats just how i am, no changing that.I know that someone will say to just talk to someone but i dont see the point. Really dont want to continue living, only reason im still here is because i found this sight while researching painless suicide methods.  (not really worrying about punctuation just rambling)    
Hello everyone, I don't mean to bombard everyone with questions but I would love to get feedback on anyone who has experienced this. If I had any earthly idea that antidepressants would affect love, I would have never started them. I was into my last year of nursing school and was very stressed out so I went to my doctor and he prescribed me 10 mg of Lexapro. I started taking the pills at the end of August 2015. In September I met the love of my life. Omg I loved him so so much. I couldn't believe I had met someone like him and I just felt so incredibly blessed to finally find my soulmate. Just thinking about him would make me tear up. I loved him so so much. We had an incredible, amazing 9 months together and I was done with school so I decided to get off the lexapro. I quit cold turkey around May 2016 cause I thought I could handle it and wasn't really concerned about withdrawl. Stupid I know. The next 6 weeks or so went great. I had maybe had a couple headaches and been extra tired but nothing that I couldn't handle. My anxiety had increased but I still felt good, very happy. And then out of nowhere, my world fell apart. I woke up one morning to realize my world turned upside down. I looked at the man I had been so crazy about and I felt nothing. He kissed and hugged me before he went to work and I had no feelings whatsoever for him. Just like that. I immediately felt dizzy and ran to the bathroom and threw up. I couldn't believe what I was feeling. The man I was certain I couldn't wait to marry and love more than anything. I felt nothing for him. I cried and cried. It has been 5 months since that day and the feelings still have not returned. I am terrified. I cry so often. I hate everything. I cannot believe what I'm feeling. I was so so happy and now this. I got even more terrified when I had read something about people sometimes fall in love with people they normally wouldn't if they weren't on pills. This makes me literally sick. I loved him so much on the pills, I just cannot even began to believe that the 9 months with him were a lie or all caused by some pills. I wish I would have never started lexapro or stopped them cold turkey. I pray with all my heart and soul that this is only from withdrawl and that my love for him will return as this gets better. I don't know what to do. It's getting so hard to fake it but we have so many amazing memories together. Please please please if anyone has experienced this please let me know. Even if it didn't get better, I would like to know what I should maybe expect or if I should plan on getting them back. I really need some help. I'm afraid if I keep going on feeling this miserable, I'll end up in a mental hospital somewhere. I apologize for the length, but I didn't know how to shorten my story. Please let me know if anyone fell in love while on pills and if you felt like you fell out of love during withdrawl. Thank you so much in advance. 
So I'm new to this. I never thought I would discuss anything on a forum especially regarding what I think is my depression as I have never discussed this with anyone before.   I am 16 years old and never really had a friend. I suppose it's because I never really fitted in. It's not that I'm socially awkward or people dislike me but I haven't ever wanted one. I never felt the need for a friend nor anyone to talk to. I guess I'm just a loner.  I have had crushes before yet never felt the urge to get to know them. I have  forced myself to go to parties or hang out with people but have dreaded every minute of it.   Im not entirely sure when it started but I have been upset for so long it feels abnormal when I'm happy. I have a few problems at home such as my dad being an ass and my mum being miserable all the time but I know that neither of these things are the cause of my depression.   My largest problem however is that I have a lack of caring for things. For example I never cared about what happened in the world or what happened in my future which has caused a huge lack of effort in everything I do especially school work.   Despite my shortage of enthusiasm I do enjoy many things such as reading, writing, drawing, music, guitar... and cutting myself. Like most self harmers I cut myself when I am very upset which happens to be quite often however I do it because I get this strange sensation of excitement that makes me happier. I don't cut my wrists nor anywhere that is easily visible so I usually just cut my chest or thighs.  As I said previously I have never spoken about this and know one in my life has any clue about my problems. Most people just think I'm some sinical, loner kid who thinks he's too cool for everything.  The only real relationship I have ever had with anyone is my mother who happens to be the only person I really care about.    Lastly there have been only two circumstances where I have been beyond miserable and have very seriously contemplated suicide.  One of them was when I father left my mother. You see my dad as well as being an ass is an admirer of attractiveness which my mother used to be but after having two children and going through cancer he decided she wasn't good looking enough for him so he left and practically started another family within 2 months.  I don't feel comfortable sharing the other one.   I guess I'm writing this because I have kept all this a secret for years and it feels so good to share it but does anyone know what exactly is wrong with me and how to fix it?   P.S. Sorry it is so long as these are things that I have been wondering for the past few years.  
I have just been diagnosed with depression and i thought i had the support of 2 friends... now it seems i have been too much for them and feel like i have been pushed away... some background is that i have went through alot of situations where i managed to hold it together for everyone else.  I.E  mother-in-law disowning my husband because she took up with a paedophile ( we have 2 kids), this is still upsetting because my husband refuses to speak to someone about it.  My best friend of around 20 odd years telling me i wasn't there for her when her little girl passed away ( i chose not to go to the hospital to watch her die).  I was there after it at all times. Finding out on facebook my aunt is actually my sister and its never talked about.  This has brought me to where i am now.  One of my friends has been through depression and helped me alot and thats why i relied on her.  She helped me make sense of what was going on.  So now my biggest fear which was pushing people away as i feel i am toxic to everyone has happened  my husband is trying to be supportive but he just keeps telling me what i have been doing to everyone!! .  I am stuck... i want to get better but every time i seem to be getting a little better someone pushes me back.  the stigma is still there.  
I'm into my Third week on Fluoxitine, and i find it incredibly hard to Ejaculate, or even get pleasure out of sex.  Will this go away? or will this side effect stay with me while on the medicaine? and is there any other anti depressents that will not have this effect on me?  thank you 
I've had a few issues over the last year or so. I started on zopiclone for a month or so to help me sleep, at this point I had been diagnosed with nothing and it was my first lot of medication. I was desperate for something g to make me better but it just made me worse. About 6 weeks ago my doctor said I have anxiety and depression so I started taking citalopram, switched to sertraline and I've been on venlafaxine for the last 3 weeks. The last few days I've been hearing loud shouting/arguing voices in my head which makes me not able to think and it makes me feel like I am going crazy. The later at night it gets the worse. It rarely happens in the day. I always feel constantly on edge.  
For around 3 or 4 months now I've felt incredibly down and just empty (I don't really know how to describe it), I want to stay in bed and sleep all day and I have no motivation at all. I dont go out very often and no longer enjoy going to the gym like I used to. It's started to really affect my university work because I have no motivation to even go or do the work.   Finally I decided to go and speak to my GP about it and she explained that because of my age, I'm 21, they were unlikely to prescribe anything and would try counselling but the earliest they could get me in is the 12th of January.  Now I feel even worse because it just seems so long away and I'm struggling to cope now. I really don't know what to do or how to help myself before then   
any advices, please? 
Hi.  I have often commented in the past about the ineffectiveness of anti depressant drugs. After going through major issues, very traumatic ones, I have suffered from depression and pretty bad addiction issues.  I've been on venlafaxine for years. But it's of no use.  It's got to the point where I can't stop taking it as my life is just finely poised at the moment and the doctor doesn't want to do anything that could upset that. After really accepting that drugs do not really work, I've tried to practice what I preach and do things like exercise getting myself out, trying new things etc. This has been really really hard for me and to be honest, even though I've battled and am winning my addiction problems, I am still hugely depressed. I mentioned to the doc about taking a new drug not so much that I think it will cure Me,but more I will take anything I can get that might ease it somewhat.  So he reluctantly said maybe mertazapine I was wondering if anyone's been in a similar situation and what did you do?   I find there can be alot of scare mongering on here, especially with regards to meds and isolated bad experiences, so I'm not really looking for info on withdrawals. Just anyone who decided to try this medication.  Thanks  
HI, this is the 1st time i have basically reached out for help. I'm a very private and frustratingly stubborn person. But i desperately need help. I have a serious case of Depression and Anxiety. Saw a GP a few weeks back. Diagnosed me with his handy little checklist and gave me a stress relief booklet and sent me on my way. Even after sharing that suicide is on my mind everyday.  I'm 23, unemployed, still staying at home with my mother and have had Depression for the larger part of my life. Though my family don't know about the Depression and Anxiety. Won't be telling them.  I have been looking for help for months but things take too long. Plus i have limited internet access and can't phone any specialists in fear of my family finding out.   I hate to admit it but i'm scared. I don't know how to move forward. I don't know how to even live my life.  I've had a rough and confusing childhood and painful teens. Not the worst, but bad enough to mess me up this bad. 
I was prescribed 30mg for a few months and I have started splitting the tablets in half and having 15mg, which strangely enough I feel better with.  What is the next step I should take to come off of these?   Thabks 
Wondering if anyone on here has used or is using buspar, if you have did you use it by itself or to kind of supplement your main medication and did you have positive results with it? 
In a study conducted into mental health forum posts the most common theme was found to be drugs, or more specifically, the drugs donât work.  We canât blame the doctors, theyâre under incredible pressure from NHS bean-counters and patients alike. I studied health economics years ago for my first degree. Even then we highlighted the impending crisis - ever increasing demands set against ever decreasing budgets.  But perhaps we can blame the Drs for their unscientific approach, if the way they administer drugs was put under scrutiny in a laboratory test theyâd be laughed out of the lab. When they prescribe drugs itâs a shot in the dark at best and in the US over 800,ooo people are killed every year by Iatrogenic Illness.  Then we have incomplete knowledge, all knowledge is. Take the universe as an example: It turns out that roughly 68% of the universe is dark energy. Dark matter makes up about 27%. The rest - everything on Earth, everything ever observed with all of our instruments, all normal matter - adds up to less than 5% of the universe. And theyâve no idea what the other 95% really is, or how it works.  Itâs the same with medicine and the brain, theyâre working to the wrong model â ie bio-chemical machine controlled by genes. This is not how it works, but thatâs the subject for another day.  And then thereâs the cartel of drug companies. I mean, no coffee shop wants you to give up coffee, does it? The top 10 pharmaceutical companies carve up close on a trillion dollars every year â thatâs $1,000,000,000,000. â and that figure is increasing almost exponentially.   Itâs predicted that by 2030 mental health will be the biggest strain on the UK NHS, but believe me you wont have to wait till then, its already happening.  In my next post I will share another bombshell with you.  Love to all 
hi,  âbig depression cant do anything even stand up as i get dizzy, big issues with antidepressants because too sensitive, psy tired of me, do not know what to do, several ad tried , i want him to find the right one , desesperate ; only 50 mg lamictal but dzzy, 5mg of prozac because cannot breathe, psy so upset!!!! ive tried moclamine, seropram, stablon, anafranil, seroquel, zoloft,cymbalta, ixel  âare people like me ? try an ad again that did not work before?   
I havenât used a forum before for this and Iâm not even quite sure what I want to say. I kind of just want to get my thoughts written down for once because I feel like itâs all just weighing down on me too much and I  donât know what to do with myself. I canât tell anyone I know because theyâll think Iâm over reacting or being too dramatic and I donât want to put my problems on to them.  It all kind of kicked in when I was 11 and started high school, my auntie died soon after I started and my mum was depressed for a really long time and she confessed to me that she tried to kill herself. I always feel so guilty and so selfish that I didnât do anything to help her but I didnât know what to do and I was so scared. I didnât really have any friends and I started to get bullied a lot, I didnât really make a fuss about it to anyone but I cried a lot and thought about killing myself and attempted it once but I feel like I was just being a hormonal teenager. After I Ieft high school and went to college things started to pick up, I still had pretty low self-esteem but nothing compared to high school.  Things went a bit downhill again when I started University, at the beginning I felt great and I made good friends with this girl I live with. But then I started drinking and going out a lot and I began to feel down again which I just put down to home sickness. Not soon after I started I lost my virginity to someone who didnât really care for me because I figured that no-one else has ever wanted me and this would be my only chance to do it. A while after that I started smoking a lot of drugs because it makes me feel happier for a while but I just end up crying every night and I few months ago I started to make myself sick after I had eaten.  Iâve been doing all this with the girl I met at University. She told me she has depression and that recently Iâm the only thing that keeps her happy at the moment. Itâs just too much. I have to pretend to be happy whenever Iâm around people but when Iâm alone I just cry and then put on a brave face the next day. We both confided in another friend that we were making ourselves sick but my problem just got brushed aside because Iâm always âhappyâ and now everyone just has this repetitive conversation about how my best friend needs to get help. This conversation has been repeated so many times and it makes me so angry because I love her so much but I just donât care and I feel so guilty that I donât.  Right now Iâm just at the stage where I just feel so lonely, I sleep a lot, cry a lot, think about suicide sometimes but to the point where Iâm almost an expert at hiding my problems.  Iâm not going to go the doctors or going to speak to anyone I know because I just wanted to get this off my chest. I know Iâm not an exceptional case and people feel this way all the time so Iâm not going to annoy people with my problems because theyâre pretty insignificant in the bigger picture of things and I donât think I have depression, I just wanted someone to tell.    
I'm on 15 mg of Mirtazapine and my doctor would like me to go on an ssri but I've been unable to tolerate any of them so far..  Are there any other options out there, I'm thinking of weening off medication all together but I'm apprehensive because of my depression and anxiety along with insomnia. Any thoughts on what to do going forward as I'm at a lost at what to do. 
So.. Hi everyone. I'm 18 (male) and as the title says I've been depressed for over 3 years. Yeah, The high school is psychologically hard.  I'm not being bullied.  Never had a girlfriend or a near person with whom to speak to.  I do have friends, if we can call them this way.. I sometimes hang out with them, when my parents give me money, just to get drunk.  I usually feel a complete failure and especially useless. I often think of suicide, like daily..   These years have thaught me some things, the most important of them is that I do not really like people in general. I can't stand them and their habits, sometimes neither my parents. I really like to stay alone thinking about me and my future, I'm anxious about my future. Maybe I'm a narcissist or maybe not..  I thought to book a visit with the school psychologist, many times, but I never actually went to ask for one.  I don't consider myself as "ugly" or a "weirdo"..  I think I'm good looking. Girls stop talking when I pass near, don't know if they like me or not. But I don't really care, I ignore them and keep walking minding my own business. Sometimes I think I'm asexual.  The things that make me feel a bit 'useful' are usually marks, just for a moment until I realize That they really don't say or mean much .. I love music, R&B (today's), metal and some rap.  Maybe I went a bit off topic. 
Ive suffered with depression for many years. I was on sertraline previously but changed to prozac and it was making me tired, then the side effects were horrible terrible anxiety needing the loo all the time etc so i came off it. A few months later the depression was no better i got insomnia so bad i went about 2 weeks without sleeping al all and developed a drink problem have have been off work since July. Ive successfully completed an alcohol detox last month, started feeling much better in myself although my body still recovering, depression had lifted a bit, i want to do stuff now seem a bit more focused etc. All my fsmily kept saying to me was get the alcohol sorted and then go to docs about depression as oviously the two dont mix. So went the other day put back on sertraline, took first one Friday night, didnt sleep at all groggy next day so decided to switch to a morning, so left saturday and took sunday morning and this morning. Im really struggling to sleep on a night, im tired but its like my mind wont shut down it strangley also makes me want to pee more so im up and down going to the loo and im scraping by on 4-5 hours sleep a night it it takes a while before i pull myself round on a morning. After my detox i was sleeping quite well! I just cannot cope with insomnia. Im on half pay now i need to get back to work soon and havent got the time or money to mess around changing meds. Can any one give me some advice is this likely to pass? How long should i give it? as other than that after detox i was doing so much better. Please help! Thank you

Hi everyone (Those who read this),  For the past year, I have been suffering with severe abdominal pain. I have been under a consultant at the Hospital for a while now, but my case has just been passed on to the Gastroenteolgy Department.  My appointment is not till the 24 Jan 17; the waiting time is up to 97 days! (redicilous right)  Anyway, in recent time I am having to take time off from School because the pain is so dibilitating! Its causes me to loose feelings in my legs, and restricts me from walking. However. In recent weeks, the pain is becoming so severe I am having horrible, nasty deep thoughts that someone my age shouldn't be having.  School are threatening to enforce action, because my doctor wont back me up in saying I require time off school.   I feel as if I am being treated unfairly, this could result in my mum going to prison.   Which is making my Anxiety severe. I feel depressed, now its turning in to Suicidial thoughts. Which is scary, scary because if it happens I have left my mum. My dad was never around so my mum is the only person I have, but I feel like I cannot speak to her.  It makes me worse, thinking how she would cope without me. I am just lost for words, and have no idea what to do.   Thank you for reading.  
hi all, i've been pondering this question for quite a while. am i depressed or just lazy? i'm in year 12 and it seems like i've had no motivation to do anything lately. i can't pin point exactly why i feel this way, though. since i was in year 9, i've never really had a true motivation to do my school work. throughout the years that sorta developed into no motivation to do anything. i can't figure out if i'm just lazy or if i'm really depressed? there are things that still make me happy in life. those things are always only temporary, though. i talked to my doctor about my depression and he said that i probably have it but he doesn't think a pill or therapy will help me.  what i'm wondering is, where is the line drawn? how can one tell the difference between depression and plain laziness? 
I got divorced from my first marriage in 2009. I was heart broken for years after that. I had always suffered from depression and panic attacks and took all sorts of medication until one day few years back I threw away all my medication in a thrash can and started doing just fine without them. The only thing I needed to drag myself out of bed for work and to concentrate on work and motivate myself was clonazepam. I remarried mid-August this year and all the depression, loss of interest and panic attacks seems to have come back. I fell sick once beginning of August right before marriage, and I fell sick (high fever) twice two months into my marriage. One time it was a severe urinary tract infection. I wasn't able to go to work for about two months. But even after my recovery I couldn't bring myself to go to work anymore. I just felt I couldn't. I kind of already hated my job, but not so much as to quit it. But now I have quit my job from a very renowned organization (very good pay too) and except for weekends when my hubby is at home, I cannot drag myself out of bed before 5pm (and that is also because I have to). I feel miserable about quitting my job and now having to depend on my husband. I also feel I am a disappointed for him. He had married this strong, independent, working woman and now I am this sad, weak, lazy person getting stressed out by every little thing. I feel I failed miserably to live up to his expectations. Although he is very supportive and keeps reassuring me that it's fine and I can take my time to feel like myself again.  When I was marrying him I didn't love him. But I think I started becoming weak and vulnerable after I started developing feelings for him. He is an incredible man, one of the nicest people I have known. He would do anything to make me happy. But what has happened to me? Does love release weird hormones? Is it having to leave my own house and my mother and my comfort zone? Is this an adjustment period I am going through? I do remember developing feelings for someone once in 2014 and the same thing had happened, I couldn't get out of bed and was fired from my job for being irregular. But that was a one-sided love. But my hubby loves me back and I trust him with all my heart. And yet getting up from bed in the morning to go someplace seems impossible. Except for when someone is with me, I can manage. I am also a little more cheerful on weekends when he is home or after he gets back home everyday. But there is still a part of me that feels sad. I was also on pills for two months after marriage until I felt the pills could have been making me feel so miserable so I stopped taking them.  What should I do now? I know going back to work would be the best thing to do to feel better about myself and to keep myself busy BUT I JUST CANNOT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO DO IT! Clonazepam used to work miracles but it doesn't seem to work anymore. Should I see a therapist? Should we go on a honeymoon (I know I will be happy during the honeymoon but I will just end up feeling more depressed after we come back)? I just need to stop feeling sad all the time, be able to drag myself out of bed and feel interested in things. I need to get back to work. Please help.    
Hi. I'm Hannah. I was put on Zoloft after 4 years of depression. At first it didn't work at all, so they raised my dose and now it is kind of working. I've been on the higher dose for a few months now. I noticed that when i'm feeling alright, I think of depressing stuff and I think my mind is trying to get me down. I don't know if it's because the medication makes me numb and i'm craving emotion or if i'm addicted to the feeling of sadness or something like that. what's wrong with me? I just never feel like myself if i'm not sad. 
Ugh....My smiling depression is killing me...litterally. With my depression, anxiety, and the cutting I can't seem to sleep, or eat. Even when I'm hungry or tired. I just feel alone and unwanted.                                              Help Please...... 
Well actually probably the majority of this semester of college. I've taken on way too many activities at my college and can't handle them all and I've pretty much burnt out and don't do anything even though I'm the president of a community service club on campus that needs to refund thousands of dollars to its members. The past two weeks have probably been the worst. I almost never leave my room, I sleep at 6am and get out of bed at like 4pm, I eat one meal a day, I skip all my homework, I cancelled all my planned activities with my friends. I'm just alone and dying and feel like I have failed everyone this semester. Sometimes I try to talk to my friends but I feel like they're lives aren't going too well and I don't want to burden them anymore. I just emailed a university counselor this weekend and hope she replies soon. The biggest part is as president I'm instrumental in getting thousands of dollars back to members of my club and I don't think I can do it but I really, really have to and if I don't then that would be very, very bad. I really wish someone could tell me exactly what to do and guide me to being able to do work again. I feel like a little kid in a tunnel with no light at the end. Thanks in advance for replying. 
So I had finally been seen by a psychologist after seeing my gp for a good solid 9 months regarding my depression. So after they had lost my referral I went back to my gp and asked him to make  the referral once again. they booked me in quite quickly. So from the telephone assessment they were given a Brief description of the causes of my depression, the fact that I know longer have the motivation to take my medication anymore, I have plans to kill myself and I am having trouble sleeping. So as the session begins I go into description of my depression and how it began etc sobbing my eyes out at the same time. He then ends the session with there's a 3-4 month waiting list for individual therapy. Cheers mate, no wonder so many people are killing themselves. I am currently more depressed having left the counselling session than I did coming to it. suicidal people give themselves 2 options you either kill yourself or seek help, people are seeking help but aren't getting it.what are we supposed to do? Pills are not adequate. 
Hi all. I have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety a few years ago. I usually manage it well with meds and therapy but A lot has happened in this past year. My mom had gotten sick with cancer in died within a year of Her diagnosis. She was my last parent. Her literally dying in my arms still haunts me. After her death I was living in a studio apartment with my two kids all by myself. I pay in rent and utilities and babysitter money while working. Being a single mother is exhausting LOL. My kid's fathers do not want to be in their life and have actually managed to to hide from the government so I have not receive child support in almost 2 years now. I have no family to help me either. I have lost a job lost my car and have literally just barely escaped becoming homeless with my two kids. I haven't tried for any type of relationship in a long time. I had tried one with my best friend but in the end it was a mutual break up. Between all of this going on along with the weight of everything else that has happened this year I do not feel like myself anymore. I had just recently found a new guy that I'm interested in and he is wonderful with my kids. He helps me out around the house and even helps with bills and household necessities. I like this guy but deep inside I still do not feel like myself. He is in love with me and told me that I make him want to be a better man and that he wants to be there to help me out with everything I need. This makes me feel happy but at the same time I'm scared. I know this man could be amazing it seems to be everything we are looking for in each other. I told him that I don't feel like myself but I do like him a lot. Something is holding me back. I am getting my medication adjusted and hoping I become myself again. I am looking for other ideas on how to get myself back and be able to give my entire self to this wonderful man and my wonderful kids. 
Someone made a reply to one of my recent posts which said:  Depression: I hate it, but it feels like an old friend. Yes, I am aware of how twisted that sounds butâ¦  I can identify with that.  Does that ring true to you too? Or is it just me and him that are weird? 
 currently Im on some pretty strong combination of meds because of a depression which started with a complete loss of the ability to sleep about 4 months ago.  To deal with my disorder I now take 40 mg Prozac in the morning to cope with the depression per se and I also take about 20 mg Mirtazapine and 25 mg Seroquel in the evening to get me into sleep mode (+ some valerian and sometimes melatonine). In the last weeks I started to feel better regarding the depression symptoms and have the feeling that the Prozac is working its magic. So far so good.  Last week I was also diagnosed with an attention deficit disorder (ADS) and my doc wants me to start taking Ritalin (immediate release version to find the appropriate dosage).  Now Im more than a bit worried about the possible side-effects regarding drug interactions. Im especially worried about suffering a Serotonin Syndrome, triggered by the addition of Ritalin. I also worry about interactions regarding the serum level of the different drugs in my bloodstream. As far as I know Fluoxetine as well as Methylphenidat seem to inhibit CYP2D6 which could lead to elevated serum levels of both Fluoxetine as as well as Ritalin.  Has anyone been on such a combo of meds or a maybe similar combination? Is there reason to worry about adding Ritalin to my daily medication?  thank you! 
I'm starting to believe that I'm evil. I'm irrational, selfish, ungrateful, ugly, and lazy. I wouldn't seriously consider killing myself, I just wish that someone else was born instead of me, if that makes sense. Someone more deserving of the life I have. My family shouldn't have to deal with someone like me. They deserve a social, happy, polite, appriceative daughter, and I'm the opposite of those things. I feel guilty when people compliment me and call me a nice person, as I know that's just an illusion I give out. I'm scum, and I guess my behaviour will catch up with me once everyone stops trying with me and I'm all alone.  
Hi currently I'm too scared to ask anyone for help because I can't trust any of my friends and I don't want to ask parents but recently over the past year I just feel horrible and ive wanted to kill myself many many times and honestly I'm just generally angry and sad at everything. 
I'm sure no one here likes being on medication, I know I don't! Most posts seem to focus on the negative aspects of medication which I'm also guilty of which makes it worse for all of us here. Has anyone had positive effects from medication and has made there life and depression, anxiety better? 
Sorry for being such a pain to everyone but this week just seems to be getting worse. Got my face to face appointment with the OHS next week got to travel 3 hours for a 30 minutes appointment then 3 hours back, can't wait!!! At least it is with the same doctor i saw last year the one I frightened as he thought I was going to hit him. Got home yesterday split my tousers cos I;m so f fat, these extra exercise classes aren't helping. Got another testing kit for this bowel testing due to blood found in the first one now I;m worried. Tried to be positive and attended the local christmas turning on of the lights that my son had arranged, saw the grandkids got over whelmed with the crowds noise and festive cheer which I just cant seem to feel. Home and receive first christmas card addressed to Mr & Mrs. That has just finished me off. Just sitting here cryng, drinking and hate life. When is it going to feel better, I keep trying but things just keep going wrong or I just can't seem to cope......I can't see the point anymore.  
so lately after something happened a month or two ago i've been feeling more sad everyday my anxiety comes along to follow me everyday too even when i seem happy there's always a sadness in the back of my head and when i talk to this person about how i feel i get overwhelmed with confusion and sadness, and sometimes i get more energy than usual in the end i would feel a dull feeling of sadness my mood can change alot over a period of time  is there something wrong with me? 
More an idea for all you out there still suffering. Today I havent been feeling my best. Scratch that, this last 8 weeks or so. I sometimes write when I'm upset, and came across a cool idea. Its the same idea as writing a letter to someone you hate but not sending it. So I wrote one to my depression. Obviously I am aware depression is not a person, but if it was what would you say? I actually felt better after writing, and its also something I can share with friends and family to give them a better insight into my head.  This was mine  âTo my depression,  My depression.     It's been many years now, since you came into my life. And I often wonder when you will leave me alone. You've ruined relationships, happiness, friendships ..anything that has meant something to me. You've made me doubt everything about myself, and made me feel unwanted.     You're a cruel illness. You show no physical side affects. There's no horrible scarring, unless you count the hundreds of marks caused by the sharp edge of an object, shoved violently across my arms in an attempt to feel something, anything. There's no rashes, except the scarlet red blotching from the hours of tears over feeling unstable. A blood test will come back negative, there's no sample to analyze. It's there, but it's not there. No one can see it. No one can see the suffering.     Nobody offers to 'help you with your shopping'. No one will 'pop in to check on you'. Because to the outside, you are just a lazy, uninteresting person who doesnât need any help, you need to 'pull yourself together' 'its all in your head'. You are the only thought in my head. You never let me rest. You make me constantly tired, but terrified to sleep. You make me want to binge eat, but sick to my stomach at the thought of cooking. Youre in the back of my every thought, every decision, every part of my life.     Medication helps, but it cures nothing. Therapy helps, but I'm still broken. You make decisions hard for me. Every day questions. Should I answer the phone? Should I have one piece of toast or two? Am I well enough to see people? What do I want to watch on T.V? Do I even want to watch T.V?     You've taken away all my hobbies. I can no longer go swimming, I can't bare people looking at me. I cant work, I can barely function. I don't have the concentration to read a book, a hobby I have always loved. I can't see my friends, seeing people is a daunting thought that makes me sick.     I no longer try to look nice. If I havent showered in days-Why should I? I'm not going anywhere. My top is stained- so what? No one would want me even if I tried to look nice. My hairs a mess? My lifes a mess, I cant fix that either. I have scars all over my body, whats the point in pretending I'm worth looking at.     Being stuck in a head that wants nothing more to destroy you, will slowly kill you. So why die slowly, when theres a bottle of pills in the drawer? Who would actually care if I was gone anyway? Everyone would be happier, they wouldnât have to put up with a depressed, socially awkward person who appears to make no effort anymore.     People who donât suffer depression donât understand you. But I do. I will put on a fake smile every single day, until the smile is genuine. I will push myself to step out of my comfort zone, because why should you win? I will get better. I will not be a victim. I am a survivor.     To my depression,     You may have broken me, but broken things can be fixed.  âEven if I've helped just one person find a new strategy that might help, then I feel it was a worthy post.  âTake care... We will all beat this!  Corrie x 
Hi everyone  I don't even no where to begin I feel so alone even though I'm surrounded by family and friends I recently had a mini meltdown as I call it everyday life got to much and I couldn't take any more this happened whilst at work before this I would get so frustrated with myself because I was struggling to support my family son and husband on a single wage that I would hurt myself. I really hate my life at the moment I feel I have no one to talk to as I feel every one close to me has played at part in how I'm feeling as I'm writing this I have tears in my eyes as I'm looking at strangers for comfort. Sorry for the melt down  
If your body posture is a reflection of your internal state and how you feel â which it is. Then your body language also helps to reinforce that mental state by producing the appropriate chemicals within your body to maintain that state.  Itâs called a Cybernetic Loop.  Have you ever tried smiling when you are angry? If you have youâll know itâs hard to do. Thatâs because your mind is saying one thing and your body is doing another. But if you can manage to raise a smile youâll notice that right away you stop being angry.  Maybe you donât feel like smiling because youâre depressed and feel quite rightly that you have nothing to smile about. But smile, and when you do, know that I will make a difference. Or maybe youâd prefer to stay depressed? 
Tuesday I am seeing my CPN, it has been four weeks since I saw Him last. It is part to do with my Conjenital Short Term Memory Concerns and my upsetting the Wife when I disappared out into the countryside several months ago. I feel in a field then because I became tired and I could not get back up. In a way I was lucky someone was passing and helped me up. In a way I was lucky as I fell on a footpath leading to a historic site and all could have been different if it happened now because of the cold.  I am really having problems now with my disability the body wants to get up and go while the disability just wants me to take it easy  We took Pax to the beach three times this week and today we walked along the promanade as the tide was in so after that I was shattered and needed to sit around for a time before I could go shopping then home.  Thank goodness for Black Friday we needed several things for the home and we seemd to do well out of it, although we had one nasty shock, the Central Heating oil tank needs to be replaced before Christmas. The season of good will strikes again as we arrange for builders to prepare a new foundation for the tank to nestle on, the old foundation is to old for todays posh one. It could not have happened at a worse time  B. 
I am very suicidal and I have anxiety attacks frequently. There are so many things happening in life. 3 years ago my father got abducted and he hasnt returned..my family fell deep into financial crisis. However, my youger brother left for university on my 150% scholarship and I was so passionate to continue with my studies (university) i got admitted to top universities on good scholarship  70-80% but even the rest I couldn't afford. I didnt want to waste my year so I started working a night shift at customer support and with $700 a month I started paying bills and rent and supported my family of 4. I didnt take a single penny for myself even my atm card with with my family. So i worked 9 hours for nothing but hope that next year I might be able to afford college. Its been 2 years and my family said that I'm a girl and girls dont need to be extraordinary. Just graduate in anything it doesn't matter..they constantly talk about the issues with my other siblings but never about me. They say bad things all the time and I have started to stay in my room all day locked up. I had many break ups and guys have literally used me for a few days and left me. I feel so worthless and used like I'm an object and anyone can do anything with me. I'm 21 and I have already given up on things. I lost my faith my hope and I'm miserable. Thinking about ending my life every other day. I don't know what's wrong with me  
Hi all,  In the summer I experienced a full on psychotic episode which although I vaguely remember enjoying(!) has left me with amnesia (can't remember most of this year), depression, the feeling of being alone now, despair, difficulty concentrating and the overwhelming feeling that everything has got a bit pointless.  I have/am seeing an NHS psychiatrist and have been put on 10mg of Aripiprazole (about 3 months) and today my GP has upped my dosage of Sertraline from 50mg of Sertaline to 100mg as I'm still very low.  Just after a bit of advice really about this combination of medication (what to expect? Will it work?), what I can do for myself to help get normal(!!) and are there any forums/groups anyone would recommend as I do feel very isolated and it would be good to talk to someone who has been through a similar experience. I live in the Portsmouth area.  Basically I'd like to get normal but today, I'll admit, the perceived enormity of the task is getting me down!  Here's to us all getting better Worthe 
I think the short answer is yes.  You watch the news and its all death and destruction and financial meltdown. Itâs enough in itself to make you depressed. Thereâs never any good news, no fluffy white cats being rescued from trees by nice fireman, or the like.  I usually switch it off before it gets started. But the other night the headline was mental health so I watched. Despite promises that funding would be increased itâs actually being slashed by many local authorities. There was a story of distraught parents with a young daughter having to travel 300 miles for treatment.  And then thereâs the constant bombardment of advertising, portraying beautiful people having wonderful lives. You canât help but compare yourself, compounding the disappointment you feel with your own life.  Pile all that on top of your own problems and its enough to make almost anyone depressed.  But coming back to the young girl, one of the most disturbing things I read about within the forums is children suffering with depression. And the research indicates its increasing rapidly.  So I wanted to ask you all to share your thoughts on why you think this is happening to them.  Love to all, Tony  
Any one suffer from restless legs and on zoloft for depression? 
Once I'm registered the receptionist said I will need to see the doctor before he can give me any medication (mirtazapine).   I feel that I still need the medication, what happens if he thinks I don't need them? I don't want to stop taking them.  What do I say to him?   Thanks  
I haven't been on here for a long time. My depression has gotten worse. In May I got real sick and it turned into a disease and I almost died. After two surgeries they saved my life but I lost my colon. I don't know the forum for that help but I'm feeling so lost.  I can't work. I feel I'm letting my daughter now 14 down. She was 13 when i got sick.  I feel she's embarrassed of me. We have been through a lot.  A divorce from abusive husband a year ago. Gail bladder surgery before that. Then two surgeries and seeing me out of my mind just breaks my heart.  She stayed with a friend for over a month.   I can't remember things right and she gets upset with me. I try to have fun when out and she always tells me to stop and be quiet. I'm not doing anything bad or around people. It hurts. It really makes me wish I died in June.  Walking hurts. The strength hasn't come back. It gets me really upset. After the divorce things were suppose to get better but it just keeps getting worse.  My job didn't last long. It was causing PTSD attacks and anxiety attacks.   I feel worthless. I'm not whole anymore and no one would want me or hire me. One friend will get together with me. But we talk about our exs which helps but I just want to talk about anything else.   Daughter and I learned not to speak because we were afraid of him but he's gone and things haven't changed much. At first it was better then it got real bad. Major attitude and disrespect. I fought to live. But I'm sick of living this way.   I get confused. I forget things. I can't get out of my depression and with both of us with it it's hard. Both have PTSD and panic attacks.   I just don't know what to do anymore. Trying to sake things to have money. I don't drive. I'm not working. If I fall I can bleed to death on blood thinners.  My legs hurt when I go walking. It hurts so bad I just want to stay in my chair and never go out.  I know my daughter loves me but her behavior makes me so worthless. I'm lost.  I have thought and almost took handful of pills but didn't do it.  I'm tired of my daughters disrespect. She has admitted to lying about things and for eight years I don't think she knows how to stop it. So I never know what's true or a lie. She lied to keep our family together but it cost be a hurt shoulder and her an almost broken jaw.   I can't myself to do anything. I'm always lost and down. I want to do something but I just can't get it done.  I'm sick of the ostomsy issues that I was having but so far things have gotten better.   
If i change doctors will I still be able to get my prescription (mirtazapine) will I need to see a doctor again?  
i went to my doctors today as i am on 40mg of prozac and was having panic attacks when i had my tablet was upped,  he has given me propranolol 10mg to help me with the side affects.  one 3 times a day  i wonder if anyone else is having problems till it gets in your sytem. 
Do these work??  
My boyfriend and I were doing great were really happy. He started to become withdrawn and wouldn't really open up to me but always wanted to han out with his friends and seemed ok with talking with them. He recently started drinking more and when I confronted him asking if he was ok he just kept shutting me out. He recently moved out and ended things with me, because I had asked what he wanted out of our relationship and did he love me. He couldn't give me and answer only saying "I don't know". For me this came out of the blue, I knew he suffered really badly from depression and had been self medicating on weed for five years and recently stopped it. So isn't on any medication. He says he doesn't know if it's just that he's fallen out of love or if it's his depression. Only a few weeks ago he was telling me how inlove with me he was and how excited he was to really begin our future. Now he says he's felt our relationship has had an expiry date for a while and doesn't know now if he sees a future with me. It seems to me he still cares, I just don't know what to do? Should I give him space to figure it out or just move on. I don't want to move on but what if he's just done with me  
the matter is that last day i fell from an e-rickshaw and thank god it was in the middle of a traffic jam. i was late for class and i was rushing. anyways i fell from the vehicle i got embarrassed because everybody were watching me fall and it was in the middle of a traffic jam so you can imagine. i somehow managed to go to class but i could not sit still in class. my fall was constantly haunting me. i could not control and the emotions were clearly reflecting on my face. i could not concentrate in my class and my teacher felt something was wrong with me that day. it was horrible. this happens to me all the time especially when sth happens in public. the think haunts me over and over and could not do anything properly. it affects me badly that i cannot concentrate on other matters as well. i feel bad abt myself and what i do is that i tell my friends and feel relieved about it. still it takes time for me to get over with the matter. i also have noticed myself getting lost after i do severe mistake because the problem haunts me so much. please do help me with a good advice.  
Hi all, thought I would reach out here. Please read my story as I will be grateful for advice and support.  I am from Australia and a few years ago, started experiencing very depressive moods due to high workloads and work politics. I felt like I couldn´t escape my work. I eventually ended up losing my job and my girlfriend due to this. I was also very unhappy with my life in Australia, coming from an immigrant background I felt like I never really fit in there and always experienced racism growing up despite being born there. It certainly wasn´t an easy ride. I guess I was always low in confidence and self-esteem looking back on life. I only had very few friends as I always felt like I never belonged where I was.  I spent months trying to find work and possibly a new relationship but I really struggled and constantly felt rejected by everyone.  I decided to leave and move to Europe to the country of my origins but after a few months here I also feel like an outsider and experience the same kind of treatment and feelings of rejection. I find it very difficult to make new friends, as people my age are starting to settle down and get married and have kids plus they already have circles of friends.  I thought about going back to my parents in Australia but the situation there is just as bleak and I don´t think it is going to help me. Many of my close friends have also moved on the past few years and have no time for me and I would have to start all over again in a place that I was never really happy to be in.  I am fear going back to an office job as I feel it will only make me worse with anxiety and depression. I did try working here for a few days but I couldn´t find a way to keep going. I broke down a few times and getting out of the house was a real struggle. I want to try something new but it is a mission to get out of bed and I can´t seem to get any stability in my life. I try to make new friends and meet women but I can´t seem to make anything click. I feel more and more alone. I feel worthless and have a lot of self-doubt and negativity right now. I know most of you are going to say seek help and possibly take medication but I have done that in the past and it didn´t really help, I am still in the same situation just in another location.  It really bothers me that I feel like I have no place to call home, no real career path and no future to look forward to at the moment. I don´t know how I can find the motivation to be a normal person and wake up and complete tasks like going to work, having a normal social life plus other activities. I guess the only positive I have at the moment is some money but it definitely isn´t bringing me happiness. Things could be much worse I know and I feel like it is heading in that direction. 
Hi All,  Not sure if this is the best group for my question, please let me know if there is better one, anyway it is related to depression.  When somebody is seriosly disabled and has very limited means of communication with outer world (or none at all), how this person can be entertained? I wonder if there are some mind games for such situations.  For example, there is a story by Stefan Zweig called Chess Story, about a man being thrown into prison who learned how to play chess and played chess within his own mind for years to resist boredom of solitary confinement.  Thanks! 
I was on 5mg of lexapro for anxiety and depression two weeks, i started to feel better but after a week or so i felt like i was back at square one. Yesterday i went from 5mg to 10mg and i feel so sick. My side effects from the 5mg wore off so im not sure if there coming back or its all in my head. Is the nausea and stomach problems the medication or am i getting sick?  I dont really feel like im getting better anymore, i just want all the bad stuff to go away so i can enjoy life. Please let me know whether or not there side effects and if so when theyll go away. Thanks Rhaya. 
I have been on this drug i.e. Motival for 27 and a half years.  I was prescribed it originally for post natal depression.  I have tried to come off it twice now and both times ended up in hospital.  I am now determined to come off it and also at the moment my worse fears have been realised in that it is unavailable due to manufacturing problems.  I only have 4 months supply left so have no option to taper off over those four months.  It is a situation I have always dreaded as it is a very old drug and I know full well that it will be discontinued at some point in the near future anyway.  I have cut down by a fifth of the dose (only ever been on one pill daily) so am on course to be off them (god willing) in the next four months - I just hope I can make the time scale.  I am very happy to be coming off them I just wish I had more time and no time scale to keep to.  I believe this is a drug no one should be put on as the withdrawl effects can be totally horrendous.  I was off it once for 10 weeks and it was the worse time of my life. I would be very grateful for any feedback or help or advice on this drug and coming off it.  I am doing it as slowly as I can i.e. filing it down as cutting this tablet because of its shape etc is impossible. Thank you for any help you may be able to give me - I need it!!!!

Yesterday I was feeling a little low, so I decided to go for a little walk, and Iâm very glad I did.  As I was walking past a school playground I happened to see some young children play Hopscotch. They were laughing and giggling and having a great time, it made me smile too.  So I thought Iâd give and goâ¦and before I knew it I was hop-scotching down the road myself with a smile on my face for the first time in a while.  You know we walk around the world most of the time with our heads down, so involved in our own thoughts that weâre practically in a trance.   So now Iâm hopscotching around the house as I go, from the sink to fridge for some milk and back again. Try it for yourself â itâs almost impossible not to smile when youâre hopping around. And donât do it half-heartedâ¦you have to give it your all.  Love to all, Tony 
Good Morning Guys  Newbie here so please be gentle!   I'm into my 4th week of being signed off with depression. I'd left my previous job after 6 years where I really enjoyed the role and was close with all my old colleagues to go to another large financial company in april. Unfortunately the role hasn't worked out how it had been sold to me and it's built up so much where it got to the point where I was struggling to get out of the shower to leave the house for work in the morning. Has anyone ever felt like that? It was like I was getting myself through the week, then the day until even an hour or so was a challenge.  My wife basically dragged me to the dr's as I found it hard to admit that I was struggling. I feel better in the respect that I went in and the dr signed me off initially for 2 weeks and now again for 3 weeks.   I was just wondering how long you guys have been signed off for and how long it's taken for normality to occur? Apologies if this sounds a daft a question and appreciate that there isn't a timescale. I'm just worried about being signed off, I'm hopeful of being offered a new job which will suit my skill set but I worry if I don't get something new that I'm going to have to go back into work and even as I type the thought of even walking in the front door makes my head hurt and feel physically sick.  Additionally I just wondered how you guys found Fluoxetine? This is my 3rd week on 20mg one tablet a day,I feel like I have a slight headache and can be a. It subdued. Additionally when I go out walking, to clear my head, I sometimes feel a bit apprehensive/paranoid if a lot of people are around me and I'm never usually like that. Possibly down to my confidence being shattered with what I'm going through.  Apologies for the novel but just hoped to speak to other people out there who have gone/going through anything similar. 
Hi Guys, My name is Bomba l have been depressed for as long as l can remember and the funny thing is l don't know why???? 
Hi, I am 24 and currently suffering from depression which is making it hard to let my guard down and go on dates. Has anyone experienced this before or have any suggestions? Thanks  
My search for a cure for my depression and anxiety turned into an obsession in searching for a cure on the internet and hoping to always find a way to cure my depression and anxiety which eventually turned into insomnia. I would search all different times of the days on all my free time and still get urges to check the internet a lot.  Has this ever happened to anyone else out there and did it only make things worse for you as it has for me. What are some ways that people think that would be the best way for me to get away from always looking stuff up and start living again?      
Is anyone here on multiple antidepressants for depression and if you are have you done ok being on two? I see on some websites that you should only be on one antidepressant at a time but was wondering if other people have done multiple ones ok? 
I'm 36 years old I married a wonderful man full of life at the age of 30 (he's the same age as me) after we married my life went down hill he became violent towards me and he became depressed. He tried to hang himself and he has cut his wrists. He doesn't know why he feels like this and I have tried everything. He has a consillor and he is on medication and he has said it was his job that made him so unhappy. I helped him get a new job and I'm so proud of him he had his first interview in 12 years and he got the job straight away. He was over weight and he lost 3 stone I thought things would get better but they haven't they just get worse. I feel like I'm living with a ticking time bomb and I have lost all of my confidence and self esteem all my time is focused on him and his feelings. Last night I felt like ending it all. I'm unemployed at the moment and I'm at the age where everyone asks why we have been married so long and had no children. I can't bring children into the world with his illness. I'm now seen in my family as the childless weirdo and I'm crumbling fast.  I was always so strong before. The strange thing about it all is I've had an awful upbringing my mother was drug addict and my Dad had PTSD ex military but I have forgiven both of my parents for all the stuff I went through and my husband was an only child and grew up with everything he wanted yet he is so ill. Can anyone relate I feel so alone and nobody understands why I stand by him but when I said in sickness and on health I ment it. 
Hello,  I have never posted on web help site but I really need some guidance. I appoligize in advance for the long post but I feel I need to explain my situation in detail in order to get some input. I have been in a common-law relationship with the mother of my two children for 17 years and it has recently come to what I think might be a point of no return.   Although I now realize that the issues have been around longer than that it all started for me 4 months ago when my wife asked me to go on a walk. Now don't get me wrong timings where not all good before that but I did not expect what she was about to tell me. That day she told me that she was "questioning our relationship. She told me that she had some issues she needed to deal with and that she was also questioning what her feelings were towards me. From then on everything got worst and I am afraid that my reaction to that day and the last 4 months made everything worst.   We have had several discussion since then but it was the end of any emotional involvement in her part and the beginning of a downward spiral for me.   In a nutshell this is what she had told me. She says that she does not know if she loves me because she doesn't know what love is. She told me that she doesn't think that she is capable of feeling things and that it has been like like that for several years. Now I must say that she is not the most caring or affectionate person to start with and that part didn't come as a total suprise but she even told me that every time she has said to me "I love you" in our relationship she has done so because she felt it was the thing to do.   It has been 4 months now that we are semi-separated (we still live in the same house with the kids and all but we do not sleep in the same room anymore) she is still telling me that she is unable to make a decision in regards to me. She is telling me that she cannot move forward in or out of it until she fixes issues within herself.   I am very much in love with her and it had been a very difficult 4 months as my emotions are out of wack. I go back and forth from telling her that it is over and we should part to being willing to stay on the roadside and continue on like this indefintely until she is able to understand what is going on inside of her. She had done a few therapy session but opt-out and is no longer seing any therapist.    I am so hurt by it that I am not helping the situation either by consistently trying to squish the live out of her. She is 48 and it really feels like a mid-life crisis mixed with a depression.   Is there anybody else out there that has gone through this that can give some guidance ? 
Hi, I saw my physiciatrist on Tuesday, only second time we have met.. I suffer with depression, anxiety and ptsd. All  fought on by a breakdown after my disabling accident 5 years ago. Unfortunately, it also brought back deeply buried memories of mental and physical abuse by my parents, and being raped my a male relation when I was 9 years old. All got on top of me. Anyway, because I was having memory problems I was refered to him. He arranged a ct scan and all is okay.  Now,, according to him I should get over it, it happned decades ago, what's done is done and I should lose some weight , stop looking so old (I just had a patient of 73 in here,he said, you are  66, and he looked 10 years younger than you) I have heard of reverse physiciatrist,  just never received it before. Mike.. 
I have just found out that my parents are getting divorced after a long marriage. We were a very close family and I feel shocked and devastated by the news. I feel like my world has collapsed around me and I have no idea how to get through this  
I've started to see my 14 year old cats health declining for a little while now. It got to the point that I could no longer see her suffer and had her euthanized yesterday. I have had her since she was 8 weeks old. I am devastated beyond words. I loved her as if I'd given birth to her.  How can I get through this pain and guilt I feel? 
Long story short (ish):  My boyfriend of a year and a half told me he has suffered from depression for many years. The reason he aditted it to me was because he would be there one minute then the next not speak to me for days without any warning. That went on for awhile, but recently it got much worse. We were perfectly happy and fine (our relationship has been pretty strong minus the depression) and I lost my temper after we had plans and he just ditches them which happens fairly frequently in our relationship. He says this is the only way he knows how to deal with it and it doesnt have to do with me. These past 2 months have been different. When i expressed my anger for taking my time for granted, i stopped hearing from him for over a month! Not one word. I tried to reach out to him but he would never reply to any messages. I finally decided to call him to ask how he feels and if we are still together and he could no give a 'yes' or 'no' answer- only 'I dont know'. I asked if it was the depression or just me and he replies 'this is what im trying to figure out'.  I know the common answer would be to walk away..but i truly know he doesnt mean what he says and really does love me and it's the depression talking. How long could this last for?  Obviously have felt so heartbroken from all of this, but I think I have made myself too available. He always knows he can do that and me just forgive him. Should I just wait for him to message for now on and show him what it would be like me not always being there? 
Done with tablets! I've stopped taking them, nothing  changed except now my Asthma has came back in full force! I hate thinking and feeling..."poor me" but it just seems like that's the case, it's like I can't get away from feeling rubbish! Sometimes I guess it's just easier to except how things are? I know I can't change things...I've tried !!!  
I am currently at work in the office, and am not having a good day at all. Started this job 4-5 months ago after I thought I was well again from my depression earlier this year.  Feeling anxiety getting stronger and stronger today and I am close to anxious tears. But as I am still in the office, I am doing my best to push through and not let it show. Some days are better and some are worse. But I cannot help to feel isolated at work, which is due to me needing to be quiet and on my own when I feel anxious, especially in the office.   Went for lunch now, enjoying a baguette for lunch, went out to eat to get a change of scenery for a while.  Trying to keep a good profession face at work is incredible hard while carrying such heavy feelings and thoughts. Doing my best not to seem or sound sad/cross/short/dismissive. Does anyone have any good advice to share that have worked for you?  Thanks for your time reading this.  Jen 
 too much going on in my life and I don't know how to handle it.... Have g the urge to cut myself.. need someone to talk to. really wanna give up 
I have necer felt so low in all my life and I have suffered with anxiety and panic attacks for over 30 years. I am in such a horrible situation and I feel that I am putting my family in danger if I stay here. My daughter who is 16 has been suffering with severe stomach cramps for the 2 months and has missed school since then. This is the most critical time in her life as it is the time of her GCSE exams. My husband is also diabetic and is really suffering with hypos all the time. I am constantly panicking that either of them are going to end up in hospital and selfishly worrying about myself as I dont want to be left on my own and know that I cant let my daughter deal with this on her own. She doesn't deserve a mother like me, I am putting her in danger as I can't even get her back to the doctor because anxiety sets in. I just need to be out of this life, I can't deal with this anymore. I need my family well again and no worries but everyday there is something else to worry about. It has got so bad I even worry about the weather. 
Hey Everyone Im New And Need Someone To Talk To.   Basically I'm a Mid Twentys Male Who Has Suffered With Depression And Obsessive Negative Things At A Very Early Age Starting At Around 17.  Counsilling And Medication Did Not Work For Me As In My Opinion These Things Only Work If You Got Friends Or Some Kinda Social life which i dont.   It also Failed To Work Because I knoe One Of The Nain CausesFor My Depression And Thats looks im really ugly it dodnt bother me as much when i was younger but now that in older im more self aware of the ignorance of some people if not mostwe live in a very shalliw world and its surely not a coincidence thats why death in young men is so common as if you are ugly you got no chance to have any decent life or make any nice new friends, which leads me to my reason to post on here im getting very upset at the noment because amytime  i go into a shop the cashier fails to acknowledge  me and when i say thank you they fail to respond it makes me feel so sad and it hurts my heart maybe im over senstive but this happens all the time now and they say thank you or greet every other custoner with open arms it makes me feel like im the worst person in the world how do i get over these thoughts can anyone help?  Also got very poor hygeine skills i lost them a long time ago my teeth are ruined but i try my best to brush them everyday but its hard i also find it very hard to get out of bed and when its tine to get up energy from my brain weakens and its like im paralyzed ita like constant rain steaming through my head but no tears coming out.  
Hi, I've been coming off Clomipramine (by tapering down) and took my last dose about a week ago. Since then I've had (amongst other things like upset stomach, bleurgh) pretty bad insomnia. Despite being really tired and sleepy, gritty eyes etc, it takes me around 3-4 hours to get to sleep and once asleep I don't sleep particularly well. I took diphenhydramine one night, which did work, but I don't want to do that every night.  Has anyone else had this experience, or just general clomipramine withdrawal experience, and could give me an idea of how long it might last. I'm really struggling to function and my emotional state is taking a bit of a hit (though whether thats the lack of sleep or the withdrawal, or both, i don't know!). I'm also worried that taking it has effected my sleep patterns etc in a more permanent way  so some reassurance that this is just temporary would be nice too!!  Thanks so much for any input  
Hi all, nearly 3 weeks ago I increased my dosage of citalopram from 20g to 30g as advised by my gp because of my increased health anxiety. The thing is I've been getting daily tension headaches and a feeling of hard to focus/slightly drunk/inner ear. Feeling and it's distressing me as I don't know if it's due to the increase or something  else as I have MS too and I know the symptoms can be similar but only really noticed it worse since increasing citalopram.. feel like I'm going mad :-( 
I have depression, anxiety and insomnia from it. I've been on Mirtazapine which I'm down to 15 from a high of 45 and now I'm starting Fluoxetine because the Mirtazapine just helped me sleep but gave me multiple side effects. I workout daily, meditate and eat a good diet and take supplements such as fish oil, turmeric that supposedly help depression. I've talked about my depression (lack of feelings) until I'm blue in the face but feel like I've gotten nowhere for the two years I've had depression.  My question to everyone is what is left for me to do I feel like crap coming off Mirtazapine and going on Fluoxetine and I don't know what more I can do at this point because I'm out of answers.. 
My situation is a difficult and complex one, so here goes.   I'm a 26 year old male, who in my teens suffered from really bad depression and it made me feel terrible all the time. For example; feelings of numbness and a sense of impending doom like there was nothing to live for. It all seemed a endless struggle of trying to find a solution to combact the problem. The result was no job, no career and nothing to really aim for.   In time, I managed to gladly come to terms with my situation and went back to college to rediscover what would be best for my life. For so long, I was not able to work because of my condition but this gave me the inspiration to beat it. I felt more assured, confident and energetic. So little by little the numbness dissapeared and a sense of normality was returning. I even managed to find a part time job.   Two years on, I am now in my second year of university studying English and Journalism. A fantastic achievement considering where I was only a few years before. However, this is where things have gone downhill.   The first thing is communting. I was not able to find any accommodation in the city where the campus is based and as a result this left me with no option but to travel by train on a regar basis. I couldn't afford more higher accomodation as no one would offer me any help and assistance. The worst thing is travelling every day and this has made it difficult to find a job to fit around it.   It's horrible to know that I am missing out on making friends because of not living there. I can't even find any meaningfull work experience and when I do contact people, they never get back to me. My original excitement has now diminished and it seems this is now a burden. The train journeys are an hindrance to my life and drain my student finance. I can't earn any extra money from working because no employee is interested in giving me the hours. I haven't worked for nearly 3 years now. My original part time I gave up as I thought I was moving away.  I'm starting to become disillusioned with it and my preperation for assigments is all over the place. My first one was a disaster and I can't seem to pick myself up. I really don't want to lose all the hard work to get in this situation. Anyway, if I would have forseen this before then I would not have bothered. I regret not applying locally.   Lastly, I have friends locally who are never interested in meeting up anymore and as a result I spend far too much time not socialising. I'm not sure my life as gone forwards or backwards. Anyway, lately I just feel really numb and in lathargic mood all the time. How did I get myself back on top of things.   (By the way, I apologise for the grammer. I did write this at 2:30am in the morning. Could not sleep) �     
im a 25 years young man I know im not a bad person , but i cant get rid of all the bad things ive done in my life , at some points ive been so brutal and cruel towards some people very bad people, and also ive been cruel toward some people which werent bad , like my brother or mother or lets say my family. i have anger issues , some crazy and insane thoughts , its been a year or more that i havent hit anyone , ive got all my feelings under control , but now i feel so confused and am sabotaging my self for all the mistakes i made , sabotaging my career and future. I am really talented and have some skills which make me uniqe at what i do , but recently i realized that im ruining my life and the results are appareant , i really wanna be my best and do my best in my life and fullfill my potential and live a wonderful life , but it seems that i am really stucked in a doomed loop.   Ive read so many articles on self-help. watched alot of videos on youtube , ted seminars , everything , now it became worse , i am really obsessed about my life and sometimes i just do things to sabotage my life , sometimes i do worse things to make the pain of the past go away.  Im not a faint-hearted guy , im tough , all in all im a man , sometimes i need to be really tough , if i have made many mistakes , i believe ive done more good things and at the end i cant decide , am i really a bad guy ?  i think i don deserve to think clearly cuz ive made my mistakes and i truely regret that , i wish i didnt , but what can i do now , under some circumestances u make them and u dont even realize it , sometimes its bcuz of power , lust , anger , sadness or .....  im lost and i want to change ... 
Im 16 and really dont know what to do. For most of my school life ive been, well I dont want to say deppresed but i have next to no motivation to do anything and have had suicidal thoughts for a while. I really dont think ill do something to myself but it dosnt stop the negative thoughts.  i dont want any sympathy. The thing is i dont have any real good reason to be deppresed so maybe its just me.I havnt gone through any major truma or accident. i havnt suffered any abuse form anyone. I have little to no friends and i cant talk to my family as im incredibily shy and reclusive. I spend all of my time playing video games, which I know isnt healthy but its the only thing that pulls my mind away from these negative thoughts.   Anyone gone through something similar?      
Dear all,  My name is George County, I live in the United Kingdom, and I work as a stock trader. I do not have experience with how to post on forums, so please forgive me, and feel free to point out, if I should fail to follow forum conventions.  Anyways, I have been in a depression for slightly more than 2 years since my wife and I got divorced. It was a truly tragic experience for me, and only post-divorce did I realise that I derived all my sense of self-worth and safety from my intimate relationship with her. I have gotten over the inital heart break, but the depression is still clinging on to me and tearing me to bits.  All and any advice is warmly regarded. 
ive beeen taking Sertraline for approx 6 months and my dose is 100 mg. the past week I've noticed my anxiety levels rise and the last couple of days I have started to feel very depressed again.  Has anyone else experienced this? Does anyone know what the maximum dose is? I can't face getting out of bed as I feel awful � 
Hello everyone, I was taking Lexapro 10 mg for about 9 months for GAD. I was never depressed before taking this drug and was generally a happy person. I decided to quit the pills cause i thought I could function fine without them. I stupidly quit cold turkey 5 months ago and I was fine for about a month but when the second month hit something changed. I become so depressed, I questioned everything I knew. I started having major doubts about life and I could see no light at the end of the tunnel. During my period I cry almost everyday for about 5 days and I'm so panicked that I can barely keep food down. When my cycle passes I'm definitely more emotionally stable but no where near the happiness I used to feel before the pills. My current feelings are either miserable or less miserable. It's terrible. I'm curious if anyone else has had this happen? Does this sound like normal withdraw or could these pills have caused me some kind of hormonal or chemical imbalance? I've been to my doctor and he seems to think I've had a chemical imbalance all along and I need pills to fix it which is not the case  I was so happy before them, just an anxious person  
Hi all  I am currently tapering down from two types of anti-depressant one is Amitriptyline (was on 25mg now on a quarter pill so around 7mg) and Cilift (SSRI) (20mg also now only on a quarter pill so about 5mg currently). The amitriptyline is for my migraines whereas the SSRI is for the depression.  The last few days I've been having what i can only describe as a dizzy spell or light headedness but it last for a split second but I am having many of these a day. My first thought was that it could be a mild form of a brain zap which I know is a side effect of anti-depressant withdrawal however according to what I can find about brain zaps it doesnât to be this. There's no pain or electrical shock feeling just the light headedness. Similar to when one gets up to quickly but it doesnât matter what I am doing or what position I am in.  Anyone else have this same feeling when coming off the medication? or could this be a symptom of my anxiety in physical form? (Iâve been under a lot of stress due to home life and work this last year).  Any help you can offer would be great.     Thanks   
I found this incredible quotation in this Dr.'s book:  "Courage doesn't always roar.  Sometimes courage is the qauiet voice at the end of the day saying "I will try again tomorrow."  She states: "Depression is the kind of illness that requires a lot of courage.  Many of us go around with this illness in silence, not mentioning it to any but a few of our closest friends and family, quietly struggling.  It takes alot of effort just to get up each day, to get showered and dressed and try.  It takes enormous courage to get up and face another day of depression, of darkness and despair and hopelessness.  When you are willingto do that day after day, you have courage unlike any other.  You do not have to shout it from the rooftops - - you show it quietly by your efforts."  I think this is so true!  Nancy 
I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for many years now. I've taken almost every medication under the sun and really, it's just been a trade-off between felling miserable and feeling "bearable". It's wintertime now and that brings up a whole new range of negative emotions and feelings from my past. I can barely get out of bed. I usually only get up to eat or use the bathroom. I've been sleeping maybe 14-16 hours a day which is irregular. I have school assignments to finish, and I can't bring myself to do them. Any advice?  
I have been taking cymbalta for a couple of years 120mgs a day. I have now been described Aripiprazole 5mg a day can anyone tell me if they take it and does it make you put on weight please. Thanks a lot Carly 
Last year I start taking medication for my depression and anxiety. I really want end my life didn't had the reason to live and really did had anyone to tell my problems and what I'm going through in life. I was victim of crime and police passed my information to victim support. So I start getting help from her but my thought things didn't change. So I tried 3 times committing suicide but I stop myself because my of  religion( probably sounds funny but it's true).   It's come time where I need go dr because of my health. I went dr they put in to medication but it didn't help. So I told my family what I am going through. Grandma didn't care; she said "when I was taking depression medication you didn't care and look you have the same problem �" she laughed on my  situation. I really care about her when even my dad left her I look after her, But still I didn't give up.   It was hard but I told my sister but this time I got I letter from dr. She believed me and she want to help but the advice she was give me I couldn't take it. She want me to leave my grandmother. I thought that isn't the best  solution.  So I called my aunt(from back home). She told me to visit her and other  relatives. So I went come back to my own country. I stayed there for 45 days. I was happy and knew there people who love me and want me to live again and be the girl that I was. But I guess my happiness wasn't for long.   Came back to England. But my sister and all my other friends thought I got married someone. Start questioning me and saying thing I really didn't do. Just because I started wearing Hijab(head scarf). But I didn't wear hijab because I got married or because I want to impress someone. I wear because I want to  practice religion. well  basically no one believed me. And I started losing friends �.   However; it's been 4 week that depression and anxiety is back. Can't sleep, can't control my life when I have my  panic attack. Sometimes my panic attack is a hour or so. When I have my attack My full body will be in so much pain. I don't see point of living. I have counselling but I don't feel is helping.   I am in 2nd year of university doing computing science and have part time job as  volunteer , but I am thinking of dropping out from university. Dr and counsellor told me to drop out because it's make my anxiety level goes up. To be honest university is my drama is something that I live for before. But now I don't want to go uni. I get scared of people I don't feel confidence on myself. I feel empty,  sad, depress don't have reason to live.   I love one guy I was in relationship with him for 1 year and we decided to get marry but I found out that he  cheated on me with 3 other girl and he promised one of the other girl that he will marry her too. Like what hell! It's be 2 years now so I started talking with other guy he was nice and caring person who was like my angel whenever I had problems he always be there. But someone told him that I kissed my ex so he left me. I swear I never did that I tried so many time explain to him but he  never listened to me or tried to believe me at least once. The funny thing is I still love him�.   Where I live people think bad about me don't know why. At the moment I don't have any friends. I thinking of end my life. I have mum but she doesn't live here she married 2nd time, I have my dad here but my relationship with him is so bad. He never tried to listen to and understand me, all he and my grandma wants me to get married one of my aunt son so I can bring him to England. I don't want that.   I want marry someone that I love not because of my  British passport.   I don't know where to go or what to do. I feel hopeless don't know who to trust. I know middle East girls doesn't open up they stories to public but  I really want my story to to be out there. I really want life a normal life and live happy. But it doesn't work anymore. The only thing I can think of the harm myself, end make end of all the problems.   I have appointment tomorrow with psychologist. I hope they will help me, to night my attack was so worst that I used google "I don't want to live anymore".  And I found this website and I decided to tell my story  instead of keeping inside.   What shall I do?, Drop out from uni?, End my life?    
Hello! I finally went to the doctor today (if any of you remember I've never been for depression) and she diagnosed me with depression this morning. She is putting me on 50mg of Zoloft everyday, has anyone taken this and what were the outcomes?? She also said I'd benefit from therapy

Hi, I am currently revising for my exams and I'm finding it very difficult to focus and remember what I need to know. What can I do to reduce the cognitive symptoms of depression?

Turns out I've had depression since my teens. I'm just very stoic as a person. I've been off work for 7 months now with totally crippling depression - I'm 31. With a psychiatrist's help venlafaxine has enabled me to leave the house again and start doing normal day to day things. Anxiety is manageable. Citalopram and Sertaline before that didn't work. I've been on 300mg of venlafaxine now for 6 weeks (overall on it for over 5 months).  My problem now is that I'm desperately sad all the time. I have no motivation or interest in life. I do things when other people are around and I can act normal but when I have a moment to myself my mood plummets. I cry a lot. Distractions stop the feeling for short times and then it returns. It's like I've glimpsed the darkness and I can't seem to shake it . It's like my soul is darkness and I can't escape it.   Anyone had similar experiences? Advice on meds?   Thank you.  
Hi there,  I've been on Prozac for 2 months (20mg), I was feeling better and it was working well, however my mood dropped and and I began to feel flat/motivationless/tired etc so I have upped my dose to 40 mg (two a day). Today is my first day and I'm feeling awful, I have tight shooting pains in the chest-some for of terrible anxiety,  dizzy,  blurred vision, dry mouth and  feeling unpleasantly strange! It's really getting me down and I just wanted to know how long it would last, I just want to feel better especially befOre Christmas.  Been bartleing with depression for around a year or so now and it's frustrating as I was just starting to feel better and it dropped again. Is it normal to increase the dose as I heard 20mg is quite low in the grand scale of Prozac. If someone could get back to me with answers and support I'd really appreciate talking to someone who is in the same sort of position as me in prder to completely understand.   Thanks a lot, Alice x 
Has anyone heard of this new anti-depressant? It is a combination drug of the active ingredient in Prozac (Fluoxetine) and Zyprexa (Olanzapine).  I'm not sure if has come to Canada yet.  So initially it is an SSRI and a anti-psychotic together. The same if you were taken something like Zoloft and adding Abilify.  The latter has not worked for me so I know I'll be looking for something else at my Dr.'s appointment.  If Symbyax is still under patent, it probably is a costly one.  But, I am going to ask the Dr. about Prozac and Zyprexa.  I have had no side effects from Zoloft or Abilify so why not?  But, hey, I'm not the psychiatrist. 
I think it all started year 2012 when I was dropped out of school.  I live in a country where the tuition fees are ridiculously high and the quality of education is horrible.  I am socially awkward. I'm always afraid of what I said sounded stupid. I always avoid any form of social activities.  I never had a girlfriend. I was inlove before but she just know me when she needed something. Itâs too late when I just realised that.  I also have zero friends. Yes, I do have those âfriendsâ before, but they also just know me when they needed something from me. So, I threw those parasites out of my life.  When it comes to work, I easily quit because I canât take that horrible $6 or less per hours of work.  All I want is to become a web developer. I know it will take a lot of time and practice. But members of the family wants me to work and take that horrible low-paying job. On my personal view, Iâd rather study web development than to take that f*cking 8 hour shift. I canât apply for that position cause Iâm an undergraduate. I tried freelancing and quit cause no one wants to hire me.  I donât know what to do. Iâm all alone, stupid, and a disappointment. Iâm not happy with my life. I feel like I have no purpose. All I want is to die to put an end to all of this once and for all. But I canât, Iâm not a suicidal.  I donât know what to do. 
Hello everyone, any type of help or advice would be so appreciated. I quit Lexapro cold turkey about 5 months ago. I was okay the first month off but oh my gosh what 4 months of hell this has been. I have been so anxious, so depressed, even suicidal thoughts have kicked in  I was put on Lexapro 10 mg August 2015 for anxiety. About a month on them I met an amazing man! Oh my goodness I was so head over heels in love with him and we were making wedding plans about 9 months later. I loved him so so much. Before the lexapro I had never had a long term relationship and I was always pretty content being single, I just assumed that when I met him I had finally found the one. However, When I quit the lexapro cold turkey, something has changed. I woke up about a month after my last dose to feel like I didn't love him anymore. Out of nowhere, without warning, all my love for him felt like it was gone. It's been the most painful thing I've ever gone through. And since quitting the lexapro, I've also noticed myself looking at other guys, or thinking about them but these have been extremely unwanted thoughts!! So maybe that's part of my ocd/intrusive thoughts? I'm wondering if I'm just one of those people who need pills in order to be happy or even have a successful relationship? Those 9 months with him were the happiest I've been all my life!! This can't be the end of my relationship  has anyone been on pills long term and had very positive effects? Or I'm wondering if I just need to let the withdraw pass and see how I feel. Even though it will be a living hell. thank you in advance.  
Not sure on anything really, just need to don't really know either. Had OHS phone call on Thursday following refferal from my manager for advice due to my behaviour/things I;ve been saying which I don't remember. Anyway cutting it short answered her questions honestly, the normal questionaire about suicidal feeling/worthlessness etc over the past two weeks. I could tell she was getting worried then a anxiety questionaire which I;ve never had before the last question was "If I told you you would die in the next hour what is your answer" mine was relieved. she then said I will have to contact your GP, talk to your manager as I was a high risk then ring me back I just said ok. I don't really care plus. Why can't I lie? it would save a lot of hassle, except all the hiding away my emotions, feelings, that has happened over the years I have hidden has caused all these problems so be honest. The call back was contact my GP for an emergency appointment and shouldn't be at work which I lost it then as I wouldn't be paid, my GP/CMHT/psychaitrsit all say I'm better off at work it give me something to concentrate on, occupy myself I rhought I was doing ok over the past months apart from a few hiccups. Saw GP he gave me medical certificate saying I am fit for work. My boss wants an opinion from human resorces who he couldn't get thorugh to for advice. i;ve been in contact with the union too.   I've been busy all weekend, exercising, walking socialising even cookedm yself a meal no wonder the snow is low down on the mountains. Plucked up the courage to light a fire as I am scared of opne fires. Today is a year aniversary of the death of my mother just remembered that I don't feel anything of that either. Dreading work tomorrow want ot just tell them to stuff it,  if they are going to give me hassle which I cannot cope with, sorry I'm rambling now been on the sauce as dreading tomorrow. Is life really worth all this heartache and hassle?????? 
I am going through depression because of my personal problems.  I don't feel happy anywhere.. I don't know what to do?? I want get ill  to myself. I want to feel happy  . Want to come out of this state of mind.  
I have suffered from depression for 16 years and usually manage to keep it under control. I dip in and out of feeling down. My anxiety is daily but sometimes it is really bad. At the moment I just can't seem to get it together. I feel awful, I am fat, I can't bare the state of the world. I am using so much energy everyday trying to continue breathing it exhausting me. I hate myself and I know no one will probably want to write back to me as I am not worth it but I just don't know what to do. I feel so alone and useless. I can't talk to my friends because they don't understand. No one understands how bad I feel about myself, all the time. I think everything would be better if I could just disappear but I can't. I feel so trapped at the moment. None of my clothes fit me anymore I am so fat. I know everyone is judging me. I'm pretty sure my friends just keep me around because they feel sorry for me. What can I do to help?? I need some help! 
Not sure where to start ano alot of people won't like me but I don't like myself either. I hide behind a smile wen I'm falling apart inside I've been cheated on what hurt like hell I consider my self to be a good dad and person but because of wat happend I went to hit the lad with a sword but my kids came from sitting room and started crying so I stopped put it away and said I was taken the kids as she had been drinking all night and there were cans everywhere my kids weren't dressed and my daughters nappy was hanging of her which u could see was soaking I got a 18 month prison sentence for abh on my wife causing her bad injury she has now had our children took of her by social I get to see them supervised. I hate myself for what I've done and can't get it out my head I think about ending my life but my kids come into my thoughts and there the only thing that stops me Ivery never spoke to anyone about this as people seem to dudge or think they no all the answers I can't talk to family as don't want anyone asking if I'm OK or feeling sorry for me I cry for no reason I've not had a good upbringing saw my dad cut his wrists wen I was 9 and came home from school one day to see he had took an overdose I've allways wanted to be better than that and seems I'm just the same I'm now 37 I work hard I don't know wat to do as Im scared to loose my children  all together  
I've been in 5mg of lexapro for two weeks now for depression and anxiety and the side effects haven't seem to fade. I have constant nausea, bloating and fatigue, it taking over my daily life as i feel sick and exahusted 24/7.   My mum was on the drug and she said her side effects only lasted a week but i feel like there not even slightly going away. How long will the side effects last, someone please respond. Thanks 
I've posted on here once before regarding my depression and anxiety consuming me. I've been on medication for a bit and im hoping to see a therapist very soon but the emotional effort it takes to just get out of bed is killing me. I spend two hours every morning convincing myself to get ready and leave the house for work and it makes me feel sick. I'm really struggling but I can't afford to be off as I've said before as we'll lose our house but I don't know if I can deal with it much longer. I often wonder about getting hit by oncoming traffic or hope I'm involved in some accident that will mean I can stay home and not have to see anyone. I'm in a bit of a rut tbh and it's horrid.  
Hi all  Long time sufferer of depression and anxiety but I also have aches and pains in all of joints and muscles.   I've always had this and it seems to be getting worse as I'm getting older (37). I take a Pregablin 200mg x 2 daily, Trazadone 300mg a day.  I want to know if anyone else suffering with the same aches and pains or is it something else that is wrong with me.   Thanks Neil 
Let me try and explain this or try and understand it myself. This evening I've registered for a 4 week fitness programme as I thought it would help me motivate myself to attend more classes than just two a week. also help me to loose the weight I'd put on while taking mirtazepine which I stopped under supervision almost a year ago. This is the positvie me. BUT also today while at work I was ready to walk out leave my watch, handbag which i carry my passport and letters in (so people know who I am or was), finance keys etc and walk across the road and step off the pier into the sea, the weather has changed drastically now it is very cold etc hopefully wouldn't take long to get hypothermia and die. I've got home following an aqua class, it was ok went through the motions, chated to the fitness instructure joking etc, not eaten much today as can't be bothered, helped a work colleague who was having an occupational assessment today to consider retirement on ill health due to her having a stroke, she thanked me for my suggestions and support. While doing this I was thinking about suicide. Why can i seem to talk sensibly to people but not myself? it is as if I am two different people. I'm trying to be positive but negative at the same time, i feel as if I need to be punished, self destruct because i am a bad person. tried talking about this during my therapy earlier in the year she was quite shocked and upset I think at some of the stuff i said and wrote that I think should be done to me looking back so am I but that is what I feel. I should be punished for who I am and has happened as i feel the only way is by hurting myself or destroying myself because I deserve it.  Does this make some sense to anyone don't worry if it doesn;t i just needed to put this down to try and get it out of my head again!!!! Life is a bit rubbish at the moment yet again. 
I'd like to know if I'm an attention seeker or if I have something wrong for the past 3 or 4 months I've had depressing moments at school I am pretty upbeat although I can slip out of this feeling at random times and when I get home everything changes i have nothing to do i dont want to talk to my parents every activity i take up i drop shortly after as i cant keep hobbies i cant concentrate whilst studying and it leaves me thinking my future will never ammount to anything. I looked through sources and found the k10 test which i got a score of 40 on which is high 
Hi guys. I have recently fallen into a state of major depression, actually in the past 3 weeks. In these three weeks i've blamed it on my relationship alot, thinking that i have just fallen out of love with my boyfriend of 9 months. I fear that I am staying with him for comfort and not actual love. I think the depression may have something to do with my birth control and the hormonal changes - but i was wondering, has anyone fallen back in love with their significant other after depression? It intensly scares me that I won't feel the same for my boyfriend as i did just three weeks ago... I love him and don't want to lose him. He is perfect and everything I want in a guy.  
Hi, I know this is a bit long but I'm starting to get worried about where I am heading and I have started to run out of ideas for how to help myself.  I have not been formally diagnosed but I'm pretty sure I have what has become a severe case of depression. I know the reason behind it, it is due to a breakup but the thing is, the breakup was 2.5 years ago. I'll give a quick overview of the situation.  I am 32 years old, I started dating my ex when I was 25 or 26 I can't remember exactly anymore. She was my first girlfriend and first love. Basically she was my first everything, I was kind of a late bloomer. Before her I was always happy and enjoyed life and was hopeful for my future. We dated for 4.5 years, most of it good except for the last 6 months. I realized I hadn't known true happiness before her and the 4 years with her are truly the happiest memories I have by far. I did have some commitment issues though as I didn't quite understand how to tell when I was in love or if we should get married. I was always one to research any big decisions and this was a big one!  The details aren't important but in the end, I don't think she told me how upset she was that we weren't moving forward because she had been ready and started to pull away. I didn't know why and eventually decided that all I knew that I did wrong was not be engaged but I couldn't feel good about getting engaged until we fixed the issue and she couldn't feel good about us until we were engaged. It was a mess and it was hard to figure out what to do. I felt extremely guilty for it having taken that long and felt awful. I also became terrified that she was going to break it off one day. I couldn't eat or sleep anymore because I felt like any time I was dedicating to fixing the issue was wasted time.  I couldn't live like that though and eventually I decided that maybe we weren't meant to be because doubt means dont right?? Or at least that is what I read. I didn't really want to break up and told her that but I also didn't know how to be ready to be ready to get engaged yet. In my head I thought that if I was the reason we broke up then I could still fix it after we were broken up and then I could tell her I was ready to get married and we could get back together. I know...it was extremely stupid.   Long story short, we kind of broke up. Stopped talking or seeing each other as much. We remained "friends" but it was with a good amount of distance between us. I went between feeling like maybe it was the right call at first to realizing how badly I missed her after a month or two. I didn't want the same issues to happen though so unless I could say I was ready to get married then I couldn't tell her how I felt. I wanted to be one of those people "that just knew". This went on for a year. I was still in love with her after all that time. I didn't want to let go of her or stop thinking of her because I knew it was up to me to get us back together. I hadn't touched another girl because I couldn't get myself to even feel okay with holding someone else's hand. She I think was dating but nothing serious and I never knew about it until she had a new boyfriend.   When I found out it crushed me. I was so heartbroken, I hated myself I blamed myself for it because I didn't figure it out faster or whatever. I still didn't tell her how I felt because now it felt unfair to ruin anything for her ESPECIALLY if I couldn't say I was ready to get married. I decided that I needed to distance myself because of how much it hurt. I didn't tell her I was doing this or why and I pulled away. I tried to date and mostly it was awful but I started dating someone to try and help get over my ex. It did not go well and I just missed my ex more. Eventually though after a few months I realized that I didn't care at all what other girls were out there. It didn't matter, that as long as there was a chance that her and I would be together again then I would never let anything else work and I would wait for that opportunity for us to be together again for an eternity. That was then I realized I was not just ready to be married but was excited! I had finally felt the way I thought you should, figured it out so to speak. I also decided I had to tell her how I felt. I was scared how she would react but I would regret it forever if I didn't.  At this point her and the new guy had been dating for about 5 months. I hadn't talked to her much for about 3 months. I reached out to her, just seeing if she wanted to get lunch sometime. She responded favorably and was glad to hear from me but also then told me she had just gotten engaged. It completely wrecked me. I had no idea but I knew that it would seem like I was just reaching out and saying all this because she had just gotten engaged. I at first just called and congratulated her but then after a few days I had to tell her how I felt or I would regret it forever. I tried to get a chance to do it in person but she ended up not wanting to meet up and said that it was hard to hear for her too even if it didn't seem like it. I ended up sending her a long email but I kind of held back a bit in it and I feel like it kind of made it sound like I just wasted a year.  Obviously since I'm writing here it didn't work out for me. She asked me not to email her again about this after the one I sent and said "but let me know how you are doing" basically saying she wanted to remain in touch but I was supposed to just forget how I felt. I told her she was very special to me and that she didn't so anything wrong, that I was happy for her and that if for any reason she ever needed help, I would be there for her and that was it. That was about 10 months ago now since we last talked. At some point she unfriended me in face book, I'm not sure when but I guess that was probably good for me anyways because it would have been really hard to watch her post engagement and we'd photos.  So it has been about 1 year since I found out she was  and 3 or 4 months since they got married. Time has not helped me. I have almost constant anxiety about my life. I have tried to date but my self confidence has been annihilated. Any girl I consider anywhere as good looking (before I know anything about their personality) doesn't really give me much attention. Apparently my ex was only with me because she didn't know any better.  I have cried myself to sleep or close to it for probably 2 years now. I think about her constantly. I have tried exercising and even traveling to other countries to try and show myself that I could still be happy but mostly I just miss her more. The regret (since it was my choices that led me here) is an extremely heavy weight I carry around. I have developed a self hatred that is something I have never experienced before. Any time I'm sad or miss her it's like I can't even feel bad for myself or try and make myself feel better because this is my own fault. I have trouble focusing and i know my work has suffered. Basically everything has lost any meaning.  That isn't even the worst part though. The worst is the loss of hope. As time passes I feel like it gets harder and harder for me to find someone and still have a family. I don't want to just get married to anyone, I want to feel as strongly for this person as I did with my ex but nithing has come close. Its hard to build a relationship when you know deep down you would choose to be with someone else if you could. So it has started to feel like I'm just waiting to die. I never used to understand suicide but this has actually made me understand it. I have never tried and I don't think I would, at least not for a long time but I'm no longer afraid of dying. It is actually something I would be fine with. In my head, that is the only way I would be with her again and thus would be a relief instead of going through such a long life.   These are the scariest thoughts. This is the reason I have realized I really need to get some help. I avoided medication because I just hate the idea that because I chose not to get married now I need to go on antidepressants. At this point though, if they could just turn me into a zombie so I can just do what I need to for the rest of my life and then eventually die without crying all the time then fine, I'll do that. I know I have a lot going for me in all other areas of my life but none of it matters.   So as you can see, I'm pretty messed up in the head. I don't expect pity, I know it's my own fault for being here but if there is any ideas you have for how I can maybe just live with myself and not cry so much...I would very much appreciate any help you have. Even just hearing of stories of people that have made it through might help!   I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, it really is awful. 
Hi, I have found many posts relating to symptoms of severe Anxiety & Depression BUT none match exactly how I feel.  Lets start with the overall all day symptoms - I always feel down, I am extremely pessemistic and I feel i have NO value in life for the future. I have had suicidal thoughts but doubt I would act upon them and you shall find out below why I doubt this:  I saw a doctor today and they think i am depressed, here is where I am becoming nervous about my health being overlooked because I keep gettign breathing issues, my heart keeps beating strange, I loose all feeling in my body and i feel completely light (my arms feel non existant) I always get depersonalization and just recently I have has the SCARIEST symptom yet: Feeling like for a brief moment I have lost conciousness and blacked out! I will be driving and feel as though i completely lost conciousness for a second and my surroundings that were once familiar become unfamiliar... I know my bedroom is my bedroom but it lost all of its comfort for me! It seems alien.  HERE IS THE WORST SYMPTOM: Last night i got an overwhelming sesnse of fear rush through my body. Remember you saw that jump scare in that movie or you saw that spider and you get this intense gut rush of butterflies and a huge wave of fear fill your entire body, this occoured on a chronic basis for over 10 minutes. I felt like i was loosing control and that my actions were not going to be my own. I was met with OVERWHELMING sadness and I felt like i was being POSSESSED. I felt like this because i felt like i was going to do something horrible without wanting to, like kill myself. i kept looking arround my room reminding myself of all the contents and ornaments, reciting the objects in my room and what they were, my family and who I was... nothing really worked, everything lost its value and association with me and I was scared that i was going to kil myself right then and there and although I didnt want to i felt like my body was going to do it for me. I felt like I was loosing my own mind!!!  I am terrified, no single day has passed for a month since and whenever i think about it it comes back, not a single DAY where I feel ok  I feel comfort in being sad, happiness feels forced and i dont ;like being happy, but i do not like feeling THIS sad. HELP!" anyone else!!? Please for the love of god tell me     
Alot of my issues stem from my health and poor joints. I have been diagnosed with cancer 2 different types  2 separate times over the past 15 years. One was testicular cancer and the other was kidney cancer. I have had both knees scoped and have no cartlidge left and live in pain every step. My left shoulder was recently redone also. I had a rotator cuff tear and tendon tears. In my left foot I have a torn achillies and been in and out of a boot for the last 6 months. I have spinal stenosis and a numb left leg. I have been receiving injections every three months to help with pain. I recently lost a job I was at for 20 years and I am now on my 3rd job trying to find a happy healthy place to work. This is the first job were I'm in the customer service  industry and I am terribly failing due to my anxiety.  I just break out in sweats when I'm under pressure. It also is a wharehouse job and the lifting and constant running to pick orders is not the best for all of my health issues. I dread waking up every Day and going to work knowing that at the end of the day I will be stuck in my chair trying to recover and be ready for the next day. I can't sleep knowing that when I wake up in have to go to a job that I physically can't do. I have alot of family problems from when I grew up. My sister and I were both sexually assaulted by a family member for many years growing up. I have never told anyone or ever talked about it before this is the first time. I see him everyday and it is so hard trying to function around him.. that is a whole new book I could write.  I have a beautiful wife a 4 beautiful kids that  love very much. Alot of my worries are how I'm going to keep supporting them with all the issues I have. Right now I just want to climb in a hole and never come out..  
Ugh feeling so low and unwanted at the moment, i am on Citalopram which seems to keep me stable for a while and then hits me out of the blue!  I keep a daily journal and that helps a bit but i just cannot shake this black cloud hanging over me! 
I feel like im just losing every little but of me thats left. My doctors palm me off and are sick of me.  Ive been up since 5am head racing pacing the floor talking to myself i.e trying to tell myself to get a grip. Ive had to come down to just 7.5mg of mirtazapine because the side effects are making me very ill. Ive tried so many ads and seem to have sensitivity to them all. Im awaiting a psychiatric app to see what i can go on but that could be ages. Im a single mum of 3 teenage boys with no help. Signed off last 5 weeks. Unfortunately being stuck in makes you worse but psychically and mentally  im not fit to work. I dont get sick pay and i am struggling to pay anything. This is the second long stint at being off so dont get employment support allowance either. I was off 5 months last uears after my depression got so severe after losing my mum. Id had depression before that but the tablets i was on no longer helped. Was put on mirtazapine last oct been up and down with dose as higher dose was causing severe anxiety and when i tried to come off them.in july i ended up in hospital for a week. So now im back on them. Ive been on just the smallest dose 7.5 now for about a week and a half and the decline of depression has now got me back in its clutches. I have a heavy menstrual period which i know will probably be making it worse. But im sitting here thinking i cant do this anymore. There is no point. As for going back to the doctors they dont care just tell me they havent got a magic wand. Ive had enough. There is nothing in my life i feel happy about at all and feel i need to end the pain. If i cant work ill lose everything 
Hi I'm so desperate for help.  I know there are lots of threads on here regarding Depression, but I can't see anything similar to mine.  I'm 44 & my husband is 42, we have 2 children aged 9 & 15.  Been with him for 23 years married for 16.  4 Years ago he had a fling with another lady, for about 5 weeks, everything but Sex.  We were having issues and he wasn't happy, same old stuff e.g. kids changed me, not giving him much attention etc.  He has never cheated on me before, but we argued non stop. We brushed it under the carpet and just carried on with life.  Last year, we had house refurbished it was so stressful, as had to live in it whilst it being done.  Ran out of money and hubby had to decorate the whole house, I can't stand DIY.  Then out of the blue said he no longer wanted to live with me, but unfortunately no one could put him up, so he never went.  Then end of April this year, he said he is leaving me and moving in with his mum.  May 7th he left me, I was broken.  Then a few days later he bumped into this other woman again and they started a proper realtionship, full on.  She has no kids, lives with her uncle and drinks quite a lot.  She is 10 years younger than me, then I found out she was someone I knew, she was one of my Sister In Law's closest friend.  Felt sick.  Anyway started to accept he had left me and getting on with my life, money was always an issue, but he didn't leave me without.  He wouldn't sit down with me and sort the money out, just said carry on as we always had, joint account.  3 months down the line, he wasn't happy with his new life, he felt guilty all the time.  His new GF, so I believe, fell in love with him.  Not sure how he felt about her, he liked her a hell of a lot and kept saying she's a lovely person.  I never bad mouthed her or anything.  He moved back home on August 14th, not through my choice.  His mum had chucked him out, he'd ended it with his GF as he wasn't happy and I didn't have a choice.  So we are now 3 months down the line and 3 weeks ago he tells me he doesn't know what he wants anymore.  He's not happy with anything at all, I now feel like I'm living with a corpse.  I believe he is suffering from Depression and I just need to let him get on with it.  I've been told I need to concentrate on my own needs, it's all about me and the kids, but the SILENCE IS DEAFENING.  He's gone to the Dr's to go onto Antidepressants and has an appt next week to allow them to work and talk through what he needs to do.  I'm unsure what to do, as I want to save our marriage, but this is all beyond my control.  I'm chatting to the wall and it's worse than arguing.  As it's like I'm invisible, he doesn't show any emotion at all.  I'm hoping he's going to go for councilling, but at present he doesn't want to.  He's falling deeper and deeper into this black hole and I'm losing him.  I love him so so so much and can't stand that he's doing it all to me again.  Even though I believe depression has taken hold.  Any advice would be appreciated. 
Hi,  When I am working or doing a tiny bit of exercise I start to feel lightheaded as if I am going to pass out it is worst in hot environments coukd just be down to depression / anxiety or maybe a medical condition that isn't that if anyone can help with what they think it might be that would be great  Thanks  
Hi everyone, âI'm a 21 year old degree student.  âSo almost a month ago my boyfriend and I broke up. I was very upset, I couldn't stop crying. But now, for a bit more than a week, I can't cry anymore, even if I want to, I want to try and move on but my sex-drive is completely low, I feel unemotionnaly, I have been sleeping in late and not sleeping well, I've been messy, at one point I hadn't done the dishes for a week and I've just been lying in bed most of the time. I've been trying to do activities like go out with friends, walk about, going to cafés and that has helped. But yesterday I did something very out of the oridinary and stupid- I shoplifted. I don't know why, I have money, I didn't need the things I stole. I was caught but no police or anything were involved and its sorted, I apologised and paid for the products. I feel extremely ashamed and its made me feel even more depressed. I kept having suicidal thoughts but now they're even worse, I feel like I'm on the brink of going insane.  âI also acted reckless when I had split up with a guy before my recent ex-boyfriend, but in a different way, by drinking way too much, I had alcohol poisoning one night and I was having one-night stands. I've managed to not be like this this time but I'm afraid it is coming out a different way, through a feeling of wanting to be indestructable or something, but by shoplifting. My ex, even though he was loving, he was kind of emotionnally abusive too. He wouldn't let me go out at night, to go to a bar or a club, he had trust issues with me even though I had never been untrue to him, he was very jealous and he even went through my facebook once, to which I had to give him my code and password for him to keep. He called my a wh*** and a s**t. Often we would get into fights, and sometimes he would even split up with me and then quickly want me back, in which case I would always so yes. One time which is shows how ridiculous it was, when he had my facebook details, we got into a fight, he split up with me, deleted and blocked me on his fb. I went to my friends place because I was upset and after about an hour or so he went unblock me, friend requested me and then went into my own fb, and added himself back. âI also now feel a little scared of moving on, partly because I miss him and hope he comes back, but also because I'm scared he'll catch me, and also the fact that he called my names makes me feel like I'm just confirming what he said, and I feel like I have to prove him wrong. âSo instead of drinking and sleeping around, I'm doing other reckless stuff, because, heck, its gotta come out one way or another I suppose?  When I was with my boyfriend, I had episodes of anxiety and sadness, where I would get very weepy and cry for no reason, and I would say it was because I was greatful because I was happy that I found someone I loved (even if he was abusive). I knew it was kinda mad and ridiculous but I couldn't help it.  âSo all in all, what I'm thinking is that perhaps I have depression, but it becomes more apparent and severe after break ups/emotionnaly fragile. And what can I do in order to stop my reckless and self-destructive behaviour from taking me over?  âThank you very much in advance I'm sorry this is so long   
My ex (we broke up yesterday), was my best friend for 9 years through the years and distance. After what seemed like fate, we reconnected recently a few months ago and sparks flew immediately. We admitted we had feelings for each other over the years and that he had always loved me and compared his interests to me and my character. Over the years, we had always confided in each other with the deepest of things and genuinely encouraged and supported the other. Looking back on the messages a few months ago..i realized we really cared for each other profoundly.  We fell in love quickly and deeply and he was the one pursuing and leading the relationship. Due to some regulations in our jobs..heâs military..he was willing to get out ASAP just to be with me. He had been doing this the last few months..doing everything in his power to get out by December 30th because it was not only his dream...but he knew this was the only way for us to be together openly and asap. I am currently abroad for work for the last 1.5 months(and we were long distance anyways in the relationship), but i noticed a change in him. I noticed in the last 1.5 week, he distant and preoccupied. He was not the thoughtful, invested person he was just recently-not even my best friend anymore. He had told me JUST a few days prior how in love he was with me and i was the reason he was making these changes for (of course for his future, but i was the catalyst...otherwise he woud've waited another year or so and not pushed to get out of the military).  I brought up the fact that i felt his distance and that he was pushing me away. He admitted that he was depressed and then I said that  maybe i needed space too so it didnt affect me..one thing led to another and we were skyping.  He's been trying to separate since he's military so we could be together and also since his dream was to finish college. It's been hard since they haven't give him orders and he's been super stressed since if they do it last minute he'll have to get an apartment,find a job,etc within like 2 weeks.anyways..he's been very distant the last 2 weeks and pushed me away but wanted to be in a relationship..it hurt me so we got into more and more fights.he admitted that he's had depression..hasn't been working out,going out, been very negative and eating junk food-he's a health freak.anyways,for the last 2 months and up to last Saturday he told me how in love he was with me,that he would drop his dream job for me, etc. and yesterday although I brought up maybe getting space and starting to feel indifferent because he's been so distant ..he started saying "you're right" I'm not right for you,you deserve better." and mentioned that he wasn't happy.etc..I stopped him and said no..if this is what you want you do it since you've been distant.anyways..he said maybe his feelings changed and he didn't want it and he's been very distracted and down and that I didn't help. He told me if I were the right person I would've helped him change how he feels and brought the best out of him. So since I didn't change how he feels I maybe am not right for him.he completely changed from what he had told methat he wasn't in love anymore, just about 3 days after he told me he was falling head over heels for me --and we've known each other for so long..I'm so confused.i know it was stressful but what do you think happened?  He started crying at the end and said he's never loved or felt this way about anyone and that's why it's hardest and he's never hurt this much. I've never been this confused or heartbroken. He also said he never wanted to put his job before me but that without even getting there that even the pursuit of his job he put before me but that he did. He said i deserve better...I just don't get it. Is this indicative that he truly fell out of love with me in a matter of a few days...or maybe never really loved me? it seemed so final for a man who called me the love of his life, told me our lovestory was something out of fairytales and one who I have KNOWN so deeply as a friend--an intimate friend before dating.  I just don't know what he has told me what is BS may be an excuse...like the "you deserev better.." line. I'm heartbroken and don't know what to do and although I know he has struggled with depression in the past...I just feel hurt and like he is blaming me. I don't know if we can be friends right away although he hinted at seeing me soon in December when he would be near my town. Any thoughts would be very appreciated. I lost my best friend and although I know I came of as needy (especially not understanding until it was too late that he was so depressed), I"m wondering if it was over in his heart and he happened to be depressed or it takes over and makes other's judgement clouded. Basically, from what I have said...does it seem like there is any hope?  Thank you                                                                      
I am 52 yrs old,mother kicked me out when 16. i have had 9 children, lost my first with cot death at 18, was with a woman batterer who i had 5 children with.divorced him. I  have been with my husband for 25 years, who i had 4 chidren with, they are all still at home (youngest is 13) Just over 4 years ago i was assalted and beat up.  I then started a vicious circle and started drinking. glass of wine here and there, which led to more and more, then the spirits. Was on antidepressents then about a year ago i tried taking my own life (bottle, tablets) decided that i was no good and was no good with life. Couldnt cope with anything.  I hide letters (bills), then try and forget about them. I have now stopped drinking for about a year now. I do have the odd glass of wine now and again. I have lost 5 stone in weight (which is good) as i always thought i was fat, I decided i would always be fat and to cope with it.  I went on diets all the time. and since i stopped drinking the weight come off. I was 13 stone now im 8. But..... I feel like absolute c..p.  No energy what so ever. I want to sleep constantly. I have been to the doctors and she put me on antidepressants (venlaflaxine) i have taken these for about 3 months now. , i feel like i have no feelings at all, and have felt like this for a few years now, i cry, i dont get angry, i have the ' not bothered attitude'' about everything. No energy. I litterally feel phyically and mentally exhausted. I pretend that i am okay but im not. The doctor wont put me on hormone tablets as a few of my family members have died of cancer. I dont have any of my family that care about me. Its me my husband and kids. Thats it.  I'm ashamed of myself, i used to be bubbly Tracy. Now i haven't got a clue where she is. I drank because i was ME again.... if that makes sence... I just feel numb... dont want to go out... dont want to eat... dont want to do anything.... Just sleep..also very forgetful, headaches most days lately. When you try and tell a doctor, they dont really listen. My husband loves me with all his heart and soul, but i cant talk to him about how i feel. I just cant cope with feeling like this much more..... I am back at the doctors tomorrow.. (not that that will make much difference) I would just like to have me back again. Have a sence of humour, have a laugh... I can't. I feel an idiot an but just needed to get a lot of how im feeling wrote down.. I just want to start enjoying the rest of my time with my family instead of being miserable constantly. Is it all to do with depression or is it to do with menopause....... as i really dont know... 
My boyfriend of one year dumped me last Sunday. Before we got together we were best friends for about another year. I was always there for him - supported him when he was going through a rough time being unemployed, helped him to find a new job, spent hours and hours talking about his feelings, his issues. He was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at the age of 17. He took some medication for it, but he stopped 2 years ago. He was loving, sweet, funny and kind, but he also had his low moments - that's when I'd be there for him to cheer him up.   However, on Sunday he told me that he just wasn't happy, that if he was happy in the relationship he'd at least be happy to have me around, but he only feels a void when he sees me, that I can't make him happy, if anything - my presence makes him angry (for some reason? we didn't argue!), so he wants to break up.   We haven't had any contact since, but I saw him yesterday at a mutual friend's birthday. He completely ignored me! And our friends told me today how happy and upbeat he was yesterday, he didn't even mention the break-up to them.    I feel so lost and destroyed  I really thought I was special to him, that I was his go-to person, his partner in crime who always understood him and never judged him. He broke up with me before a few times, the longest we went without him wanting me back was 5 days about 2 months ago. Since then we've been on holidays together (it was amazing!), booked another holiday in June. It was his birthday 2 weeks ago and he was telling me how much he loved me and how grateful he was that I'm with him. And then within a week everything changed. When I tried to remind him what he had said just very recently, he only answered that his feelings change very quickly.   I don't know what to do nowâ¦ is this behaviour something you have come across? Will he be back? I really want him back, because I want the good and the amazing that he has to offer, making me the happiest girl in the world. Whad should I do? Just ignore him and avoid all contact, or should I text him that I'm here when he needs me? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! 
I'm in bad health, finances bad, marriage falling apart, terrible dreams and sweats and cramps at night, anxiety and rapid heart rate early morning and lack of interest in anything....feel like life is over. So sorry to bother, just feeling so very alone and small.....thanks 
Wish I knew what this was, what I was, who I am? Truth is I was confused before but now...now I feel I have no idea what the hell is going on with my life! I feel so lost! I'm not the same person I used to be, it's so scary! � 
I just want to scream or shout until every bit of rage is out. Then fall to my knees empty. I'm done with being ill. Its p*ssing me off. 
Hello all. I wanted to start a thread for people who are recovered or well on the way to recovery to share there stories. I feel it's a great way of letting others know that you where once in a dark scary place,that depression and anxiety once ruled your life but you overcame it.  Everybody gets a sense of reassurance and hope from others that have suffered and come out the other side.  There are far too many stories on the Internet that just drag people further into despair because usually people only post on forums when they themselves are struggling and living the nightmare. When we read these stories we lose a little hope. It doesn't even enter our heads that the success stories are probably many but people once they come through depression/anxiety are to busy being happy,living life and wanting to forget about this horrible stage in there lives to take times out to write about the fact that they beat this. I just want people to have a little hope that things can and do get better and I'm hoping you guys will help xxx 
Im 17 and was diagnosed with depression in 2013, later that year I was put on 10mg of citalopram, then up to 20mg, then after a year or so that still wasnt helping so i went up to 30mg. Throughout the 3 years I've been through therapy, discharged then went back, then changed therapist then was discharged again. I'm still a mess, i get upset for no reason, constantly stressed, always feel restless and cant stop jiggling my leg, crying more than i like to admit, my head is so foggy i cant pick one thought out from another? Im in my second year of a levels and i need to be able to focus but my mind just wont let me concentrate or recall things, my memory is dreadful, not being abe to remember something that i did yesterday or from the morning. I just dont know what to do? do i up my meds? go back to therapy? just givee up altogether?  im begging for someone to help me figure out a way to beat depression. 
Good evening all  I was hoping for some advice or guidance.  I have recently moved to another country for a working holiday, I have been here two months.  Before coming here I struggled with depression and anxiety, negative thinking.  It has been a period of a lot of uncertainty, even more so for the last year or so in the build up since I decided to do this experience.    Since I have caught here I have had a lot of ups and downs and I'm a bit dissapointed I haven't enjoyed the experience as much as I thought I would, it hasn't been what I thought it would.  I got a great opportunity to learn and work doing something I love here but i can't help but feel myself overwhelmed and stressed a lot by it, scared of failing, worried I'm not good enough for that or I'm bad at it, worrying a lot what others think of me.  I am not sure whether I should call it a day and just return home and seek help there or stick it out for a bit and try and overcome the challenge.  It feels like a lot to handle sometimes though and I can feel miserable sometimes.  My family are great and supportive but it feels hard to speak to them about it sometimes or to feel like they understand as they have never been through it.  I feel a bit lonely, down and lost and am not sure what the best way to deal with it is.  I use a diary often to combat thoughts but sometimes it isn't so effective.  Best wishes all    
Hello,    Firstly,my english isn't my mother tongue so I'm sorry for spelling mistakes.  I won't talk in my own languague because I won't be recognize.    In this times, I've been feel depressed. It's hard to me to accept myself, I hate to see my face in a mirror. I always hide me behind someone I can't show my face to other people. The worst is when some people say "you're ugly".

But even without those problems my life is really boring, I just hate it. I'm at school for more than a dozen year and after then, there is university. Some  of other students act like 5-years-old kids. The life I lead don't suit me at all.I want more independence and less stress. I had never like my life but I am melancholic now, everything is getting worse and worse.   I try to be kind to other people but they are just nasty with me. I'd like to have peace and a quite life. Sometimes, I ask to myself if I did something for deserve that. I'm opress from everywhere; school, home,..Finally, I want 2 things cry and die.  What should I do for get better? Please help me. 
I am looking to try and compare the side effects of doxepin and dosulepin to other tricyclic antidepressents to make sure I ma prepared before my doctors appointment. I particularly want to know how severe the side effects are 
I just have reached the end of everything.  My relationship history is disastrous- I turned down a girl I was in Love with as a teenager and ever since its been one crash after another. I allowed other issues to make my decision and it was a bad one.  Two long term relationships I ended- each one I loved but was never 'In Love' with. The seconde one ended because I was in love with a girl at work: who just used me to get her boyfriend back.  Last workplace I had a girl attracted to me who I rejected kindly because she was engaged but she made my life a nightmare.  But the latest really sums up how terrible much life is - it's left me in despair.  A much younger girl made it clear she liked me from day one- exaggerated beside me, staring at me, smiling. But because of what had happened before, and because I was honestly a bit intimidated by how pretty and perky she was I pretty much ignored her. She even used to work late so we were together but somehow we seldom spoke. Frankly, it was up to me to break the ice and I didn't.  You can guess what's coming- I ended up working beside her months laterand got on great with her. Buthe by then she had a boyfriend.  My life was going off the rails at that point and Finding out she was leaving didn't help. I was off a month with depression. Came back to find she hadn't left- but she had got a flat with her boyfriend.   Somehow although it was now easier to talk to her it also became awkward- not as smooth.  I made time to talk but I worried if she was twitchy- not the right word but I can't describe it- because of her situation or because she found me creepy. I don't know why I thought that but I couldn't understand why we seemed awkward. Maybe it was me. I only spoke when we met though I did find myself looking at her as she used to at me.  I had a crush- I admit it.  So I kept a distance.A few days after we almost bumped into one another and the way we looked at each other I can't explain- awkward but..I don't know. She said hello, I said hello, we walked on.  So she went off to train others for a month and I never saw her. The office is being rejigged and she definitely is moving now.  Now comes the reason I'm writing this- because this is both painful and truthful.  As I was leaving I came out the kitchen she had came up(maybe to see if her pal had gotten everything from her desk) and was saying Goodbye to the few left- I'm usually last to leave. As she passed I asked how she enjoyed training.  She didn't stop, said 'Fine' and never made eye contact. Said her usual flamboyant goodbye to the last two managers left and that was that.  Going downstairs five minutes later she was at another door nearby with her phone, perhaps waiting on her boyfriend.  She looked up, saw me, and turned her back to me.  That hurt more than you think.  Because at that moment I realised I had become that Creepy Middle Aged Guy- somehow everything had went wrong and I was to blame. I walked past- I would never do anything to unnerve her or make her uncomfortable but she had said all she had to without a word.  I have now truly realised how sad I am. Whether she dislikes me as weak for not responding at the start or creepy for trying to remain friendly it says it all about me.   Pathetic, sad, creepy and unlikeable. Yet they seem to really like me at work. Managers, staff, canteen, cleaners.  Maybe I'm deluded and it's simply pity for the Oddball.  I have considered suicide now for some months.   Now I know I have to- I have to leave with some dignity and control.  I won't be that sad old man at the bar.  I have to leave with something. 
Another episode. It's been coming on for weeks. You KNOW the symptoms... Angry, tearful, paranoid, angry, spaced out, coping, tearful, angry, paranoid, resentful.....   Unsure if i'm right, wrong or not even worth the effort right now. Has anyone found a good way to explain this to their partner yet??  Don't want to bother friends or family - everyone has thier own stuff going on, and there's always the "people are worse off than me" thought going round.  I AM grateful for what I have, but I can't shake the feeling that just isn't my life.... Had it for decades,,, just dealing with it - STILL x 
She had told me that she wasnt happy and i've tried really hard to get her to get help but she just doesnt believe that any help out there will do anything for her..and i know that the worst thing you can do is just sit at home with it and go down further when you are depressed like that...Also, she had unfortunate experiences in the past like sexual assault and abuse, which she hasnt yet had help with. She just keeps saying though it wont help her to talk to a psychologist or psychiatrist because it wont change anything. What do I do? I really love this girl and she really has so much more to her than just this... 
HI, So my boyfriend and i were madly in love, i still love him more than anything. But in the last few weeks he has become extreamly depressed (he has suffered from depression and ocd since 7) and says that can't feel love or affection or any positive emotions. I am trying to be supportive, and I tell him I will wait untill it goes back to normal but it's so hard looking into his eyes and seeing no love there. It breaks him up too, becauase we had it so good and there is nothing he can do to get out of this depressive episode. He really does want to love me again. Im feeling really scared and sad, has anyone been through this? Will it be ok? thankyou.  
so most of you know me already on here, ive been on 50mg sertraline for a year now. I feel like im better, just put a lot of weight on  but thats ok as long as im well. i also want to say that anyone else suffering or at the begining of taking sertraline or any meds, please please keep taking it and you WILL get better , but nit straight away and it will be a bumpy road, it gets a lot worse before better, ill never forget what i went through its kind of scarred me for life or i guess i should say its changed me Thank god. Have faith in god be strong and dont just rely on meds. Anyway, im trying to come off the sertraline, only because i dont want one day for it to just stop working and i fall ill again.  What i have been doing for last 3 weeks is just biting a quarter of the tablet off and disposing of it and taking the rest, ill do this for another few weeks i think and then take it to half, anyone with experiance please let me know if this is safe? im feeling ok not feeling any withdrawels, but could it hit me out the blue???  Thank you all, much love and huggs, xx 
Some of my friends make me feel like i know nothing and like i'm totally abnormal and worthless. I thinki'm useless because my brain doesn't work right (not in a handicapped way) in a way that i can't really focus or do anything, not even read well and focus on what i'm reading. I feel totally devasted and depressed. I went to a psychiatrist last March but i stopped going but still is taking the medicine, just a bit less. What do you guys think, i need some help. 
Hi loves i've posted on here a few times so I'll give this a try again.    I was wondering if anyone knows of any AD's that do not give the whole "depersonalization" side effect. OR- if yall have any suggestions for herbal or vitamin supplements, for mild depression. Just something to give me a lift throughout my days as I am in college and kind of struggling to see the light. Anything I could ask my doctor about!  
I feel really really unhappy about people who sitting around me or stand next to me, they always touching their noses like i am smelly or something. I don't know if i am a smelly person. I am a clean person. I always take shower in the morning and night. I wash my hair every night. I also use perfume and body lotion every time but still people always touching their noses when they stay or sit next to me. This makes me feel horrible and like i want to disappear from this earth. I feel like i don't want to see them. I feel embarrass. I REALLY am depressed. I also ask my dad and family about smell but they don't smell me or anything.  
Hi everyone. I am sorry to post this. I do want to say this, I love everyone, I do not want to cause fights and would prefer opinions or political talk to remain kept to oneself on this post. I would like to keep peace and kindness to one another and only communicate care and kindness. God Bless you for reading. <3   I have been suffering from deep depression lately.. I know I can sound petty sometimes but I just really care. The politics going on and the hatred from both sides on political matters is making me lose hope on my dream.. and I love my dream. It is like a child to me, I've become motherly to it. Can someone give advice for gaining my passion back? I will always love my dream and I always have passion.. some days though I feel like I can't achieve it though.    Thank you so much.. God Bless.  
Was wondering if anyone here is on a specific diet or what foods people may use to help with depression. 
I know we all go through break ups and sometimes we either see it coming or we don't - either way it blind sides us. But my (ex) boyfriend broke up with me on the count of he's depressed. We've been with each other for almost a year, I actually lost my virtue to him. There's a small age difference but so many similarities.   The night he broke up with me I wasn't expecting it, I had a feeling for a couple of months that there was a huge rift between us. He stopped caring and started talking to me with less affection and also started being meaner and a little tense with me. He suffers from depression and is possibly bi polar but that doesn't matter to me I love him.   I asked him if he fell out of love and he simply stated that the love was missing. I was flabbergasted. Then he went back and said it was not love and that I need to understand how depression works. He says he has battles with himself and loves himself one day and then another day he doesn't. He said he's trying to get closer to God and that God is helping him view himself as a better person. He said he couldn't let me bloom and that he was not letting me be the person that I am or that I wanted to be.   I feel completely hurt and beside myself with all of this pain. I have never loved someone as much as I loved him. But, the break becomes confusion when days after He broke up with me, he sends me a care care package. With a card, gifts. The card itself broke me down, he wrote I love you, and with that I cried for several days, reliving the pain once more.   Right around my birthday I texted him, a month after he left me. To get some answers. He blamed himself and his depression and leaving me with "you should now digest your existence and gain self love." I was confused and also hated him a little for that odd idiom. Once more, a few days after my birhday, which he texted me and I gave him the cold shoulder - thanking him more for remembering. But then, another package arrives, and when it does I broke down crying. He brought me clothes, a card, gifts and another card. The card this time leaves evidence that he wants me to move on but it states that he loves me. Then I see a wallet. What's inside the wallet is a paper airplane.  Needless to say when I asked him about all this, he gave me parables as answers. He said he knew it would "strike a cord" with me. I sent him a huge paragraph basically telling him that I still loved him but how can he except me to deal with getting dumped if he keeps sending me a package every month?  He answered with "don't worry I won't ever send you anything again. God bless you."  Where do our hearts lay? I obviously still love him and I can't keep crying about this. I've loved him for much longer than we've both been together. Please help 
I am permanently disabled, with depression, ocd and anxiety. Everyday I wake up so dissapointed I am still alive! I hate my life and there is nothing more that i want other then I pray I would die everynight and not have to wake up come morning. I am stuck living in a place were I feel used, disrespected and I feel as though I am nothing but the maid for everyone in this place. I am stuck living with my mother, and that was fine up until my sister came and moved in with her 8 year old and 16 year old. Before June my sister was home but not much and would let these kids do whatever they wanted how ever and whenever they wanted just to keep them shut up so she could sit out in the garage sitting on her phone all night smoking as we are not allowed to smoke inside the house only out in the garage. Her 8 year old hews like adhd or is just lacking the attention that her mother should be giving her but instead as I said ignores her to sit on her phone and smoke. Since June she has been gone to correction officer boot camp and now is working in a prison so far away that she rents an apartment to live away from home and her kids me and my mother are left to raise. It has been 5 months and I cannot take anymore. When she does come home again all she does is sit on her phone and smoke ignoring her kids even when she is home which is maybe 2 days every 10 days or so. My poor mother works 70+ hours a week and then has to drive my sisters kids all over the place as I don't drive due to my disability. I am like the maid in the house though, I clean do all the laundry and try to cook as much as possible too. There is 7 people not counting myself that I am cleaning up after and I can't take anymore, I feel so used and disrespected yet I feel guilty and bad that my poor mother is stuck taking care of all this that I don't want to leave her but honestly at this point I wish I would die everyday instead. Honestly I am stuck here because I do not get much money from disability that I could not afford a place on my own. Yet I am in so much pain, feeling used and disrespected and guilty for not being able to do more all while my sister is out drinking and having a good old time everynight out where she lives as my mother and I struggle taking care of her kids. I don't know what to do i feel stuck with no other options other then to pray I die every night. Besides my cats I have nothing absolutely no reason to want to live. I wish I would just die!!!! I think about just overdosing because I have no reason at all to want to wake up and continue doing this every single day! I feel so stuck and left with no other options. I just wish I would die! 
Hi,   This is my first time posting here. I've experienced depressive episodes on and off since the end of last year. My depression is mainly linked to uni and the stress of the work. I've been with my new boyfriend for 2 months and he makes me amazingly happy. The problem is that he is the only person capable of cheering me up right now and I don't want to be dependent on him. I love spending time with friends and I enjoy spending time in nature to help with my depression, but because of how busy I am with uni (it's my final year) I don't have much time to do these things. By the time I get home from uni I just want to sleep.  Does anyone have any advice on how I can become more independent from my boyfriend and find other ways of making myself happy?   Shannon  
Does anybody get the feeling that their life is kind of disjointed and there recollection of events is really vague? Kind of like a fog the gets worse in certain situations. Is this a normal feeling with depression? 
Hi everyone!   I have been depressed for two months and after going to see everyone that I could possibly go to see about my depression, there is nothing anyone can do about it , not pulls not my family and not my friends and I hate living with it, I'm constantly unmotivated and wanting too kill myself , sometimes I sit in class in school and think about ways to kill myself, I hate it !!  
i sometimes dont understand what is happening to me--am i losing my control--it stays for sometime and goes off a mental ache and few times restlesness  and thoughts just rushing in.  consulted psychartist-- 3rd medicene continuing in 4 months---no change  was deficient in vitamin b12 and d3  taking tablets for it.  any suggestions pls 
Hi there, I've been meaning to post on here for quite some time but haven't got around to it as quite honestly, I haven't been on here.  Just to give you a brief backstory, this time last year, I was going through the worst period in my life. (Work stress,family illness, burning the candle etc) basically I was in total despair. I thought I'd lost myself and everything about myself that I'd previously taken pride in, my appearance, personality sense of humour. Depression and anxiety hit me so so hard and I spent a period of about 4 months a shadow of my former self.  I wasnin despair and came in here and posted several times and visited the doctor who prescribed me an anti depressant (Vito something I honestly forget)  I had what I can honestly say was the most challenging period I'd been through couldn't sleep, lost a stone and a half and seemed to exist in a diet of coffee and cigarettes. If I stayed at home I'd be restless but if I went out with friends, i was only so conscious that I couldn't be "me" and it was noticed by all.  My family found it tough and no matter how many times i tried to "pull myself together" it didn't work at all. Anyway the positive bit..  I never actually took the anti depressant as the general impression I got was that it could cause side effects that could make things much worse, I felt at the time that I was looking for a "magic" pill that would somehow erase my problems but in my heart if hearts I knew that would never be the case.  The nightmare ended literally the day my employment situation changed (I got a new job that instantly took away the pressure, stress and worry of unemployment) I had a bizarre feeling once the problem had been taken away of feeling numb but it was a nice feeling as the chaotic negative thoughts had stopped. I slept well, are well and within 3 weeks of changing my job, I was the old person I and so many people had missed.  The period of turmoil I went through did have a profound effect on me as I became fully aware of how fragile even the strongest of people can be if circumstances aren't kind to them and it taught me (during my low point) to appreciate all the good things I have in my life. To that extent, I've lived life to the full all year not worried about pettinesses and have enjoyed each day if ever feeling down, reminding me of the time a year ago when things were much much worse.  I'm not saying my depression was a good thing by any means but it's clearly true what they say that it does make you stronger once through it and I wanted to share with anyone who is interested the fact that things can and do get better.  I also believe that it's important to stress that I didn't take any of the prescribed medications and that my issues did literally go away the moment my circumstances improved. I know that this isn't the case for everyone but i for one believe that in many cases it's the cause of a problem that needs to be remedied rather than medicating ones self to unleash further problems.  The bottom line id like to say to anyone who felt how i did 12 months ago is that no you're not "going mad" everyone has their share of bad times (with varying degrees of intensity) and things do get better! No you don't need to pop pills if you know that the cause of your anxieties are and hopefully circumstances will be kind to you in order to resolve them.  Peace and love to everyone who needs it x 
I have frequent mood swings that switch back and forth between feeling nothing and feeling too much.  I get angry quickly, but I can just as easily ignore what I'm feeling and shut down, hiding in my own head.  In my bursts of anger, I often have self-destructive thoughts.  I frequently think about harming myself, but the only reason I don't is because somebody would notice and I wouldn't be able to play it off as an accident.  In between my bursts of emotion, I feel as if in a haze, not particularly thinking about anything.  I look at my life as if through another's eyes.  I recently was asked how old I was--sixteen--and I couldn't remember.  When I finally did remember, it didn't feel like the age truly belonged to me.  I feel a detachment from my life.    I have a severe lack of motivation to do anything, even activities that I once enjoyed.  When I do something that I once considered fun, I don't really feel anything.  My lack of motivation and my detachment from everyday life are detrimental to my concentration.  I have difficulty even thinking about a book as I am reading it--even a light novel that I am reading for pleasure!  I am frequently lonely because I am extremely introverted and have no friends.  When the stress from school builds up, I feel like crying, but no tears come--I lack the motivation to even shed a tear--so I just lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, numb to the world.    I don't want to tell my parents about this, especially my self-destructive thoughts.  I said something once--the situation spiraled out of control and I played it off as a lie--and I will never say anything again.  I don't want their pity or the suffocating overprotective behaviors that come with it.    I have been to several therapists, none of which have helped.  I am desperate to find comfort, but I am terrified of the disappointment of rejection.  People will always let me down, so I never let anyone in.  These contradictory thoughts are always battling within my head, so I stay safe and alone, silently breaking inside.  What can I do?  I need help, but I can't find anyone to help me.      
 What a world we live in hey...  Our daughter went to the doctors this morning, she has been suffering from extreme depression, and quite confussed in her manner, not eating, a history of Kidney issues and infections,late last year collapsed and spent a week in hospital, This she explained to the doctor. The only thing the doctor said was you are just a little tied and need to rest, my daughter asked the doc would it be ok to bring my mother in so she can explain more, doctors answer was NO i have other patients to see.  It is quite obvious to us as parents our daughter has problems, where do we go from here ?.  My wife and i are at out whits end, not knowing how to deal with our daughter or the surgery.. Its all become to impossible... 
A little update !   Depression is the worst, I can't even live a normal life without worrying about something, or even doubting myself all the time, I feel like nothing can help me anymore, not pills or family or friends !   This needs to end !? 
Depression late night how to sleep 
Hi, I've been on Prozac for around 5 weeks. It has helped me a lot, after about 2 weeks I felt the physical symptoms lifting somewhat and after a month I noticed my mood lifting. 5 weeks in a feel better but not perfect, I'm still not very motivated, I don't enjoy much and I feel like I'm in a fog still. Will my meds now be at their full effect, Should I ask to increase my dose or stick with it for longer and hope it fully improves? 
Thoughts today have been very few yet the night comes and my head is overloaded!...I've written on here many of times and I'm sure you're all fed up with me but just a quick question If anyone could answer or at least relate? Do you/can you get through a day albeit struggling but at the same time the thoughts are kinda at bay? Or at least take a back seat? But then the night time comes and it's just so overwhelming ? Xx  
I had an abaltion because I was having fast heart rate but before this it was happening for 3 months till they finally knew what it was. My mom was on vacation when it first started and I was SUPER scared I had to go to hospital visits by myself. I starting losing weight quickly due to stress. My mom was there after she came back from vacation. I could stop the worry and it turned into panic attack and anxiety. I worry so much I became so depression and felt worthless, helpless,and stupid and ashamed. My mom recently told she won't baby no more and I have to snap out of it, doctors say your fine nothing is wrong with you, your going to make me depressed and I refuse to let you do that. Tough love this point in my life feels like I'm alone and makes me shut down even more then I did. If you give up makes me not even want to try what for, After that I felt like a burden I don't want to do nothing anymore I care then I don't care. I wish I had the strength and hope to be strong for myself I feel like $hit. I'm waiting for my doctor to assign my a therapist. I'm not suicidal I do want to give up and isolate myself. If anyone has advice or been there please respond

Quite new here and thought now is the time to get help. Days seem to get worse and worse, feel depressed all the time and it's ruining my relationship. Anyone the same? 
Hi, for many years now i have been kidding myself that i am fine and that maybe i'm just unhappy with how my life has turned out which in part is true but to tell the truth i've always known that i'm suffering from depression and it has now become to hard to hide. The way i feel at the minute i just want to hide away but thats not possible when you are trying to hold down a full time job and act normal (put a front on in front of work colleagues). I have never admitted to anyone how i feel but i finally told my daughter a couple of days a go and although she didn't say so i know she must feel  let down by me because im supoosed to be the strong one and let her now that everything is ok  
These past two months I've been feeling very unmotivated, I don't really know what is causing this to happen , school has been very hard lately and the teachers have been giving me a lot of work. It has been stressing me out so much! So much to the point that I don't want to go to school. I also wanted to do computer science but I have completely lost interest in everything I do, even outside of school I no longer want to go out with my friends and go to family occasions. I really need advice as to what I should do , anything to help would be fine !! Thanks  
I started at 25mg and upped it to 50mg after the first week.  Took 75mg 2 days(start of week 3) now and I'm not experiencing anxiety. Just very low mood and unhappy. Is this just part of the dose increase or the 4-6 weeks for the med. to take effect? 
I can't get suicidal thoughts out of my head, I've got the radio on for distraction, tried reading tried puzzles to occupy my brain but self destruction won't go away. I should go out but not s u 're if ill be safe. Should go for a walk. Want to smash stuff up. I hate feeling like this, I hate myself so much. Should phone the Samaritans but all I want to do is scream, shout swear . I need my head to just shut the f up. I even slept for at least 5 straight hours last night that's a record. My heads racing I just want it to stop. 
Hey everyone!!!  I've been severely depressed for a long time now and recently just started taking celexa for this and it sort of seems to be helping but the depression is still stronger than ever. However the one thing that's driving me over the edge and making me extremely suicidal is its effects on my speech. I'm not even sure if that's what's even causing my speech problems but I find that speaking is extremely difficult for me almost like as if I have no fuel to speak or the act of speaking is almost impossible and it seems like my speech center in my brain is damaged even though I've had an MRI and nothing was found.   The best way to describe this is that I know what I want to say but saying it is almost impossible and when I do get it out it seems like my brain doesn't want to cooperate. Long sentences are almost impossible All I can get out is one one word answers. It's extremely frustrating and causing me to have serious suicidal ideations.   The depression I can maybe tolerate but the speech problems is what's driving me over the edge.   I don't know if this can be caused by depression or anxiety or even lack of dopamine etc but this doesn't seem like a common problem with depression.  Please offer insights!!!! Thanks.  
I am so depressed and anxious. The past 2 days have been hell. Ive cried most of the day. Cut myself. And been so terrified of what i will do. I have a dr appointment on Monday. Ive been depressed for 2 years but only had a few bad episodes. Im on venaflaxine 3 a day. But they just dont work anymore. Ive done counselling and im doing cbt at the moment but nothing is helping. Im hurting my mum by being like this because she worries about me and she doesnt need it. If i kill myself she wont cope but I cant cope staying here. I keep thinking i could throw myself down the stairs  or fake a car accident but that might not kill me and ill just end up injured and back to this state im in. I pray every day i get cancer and die   Im so desperate for help but ive tried everything. I even asked if i could be admitted to a mental home or even to hospital for a few days but my mum said the hospital wouldnt do that. Im not strong enough to keep fighting.   Please I need some help 
So im an 18 year old guy, and I recently made a post about how I went for surgery on my appendix and ended up also getting antidepressants. I started on 20mgs of citalopram and had some major depression anxiety ect but that has since changed and is not so bad. HOWEVER now I seem to be having a problem with my libido.   They warned me that it could effect libido but there was meds I could take to *ahem* get it up. But my problem is not that simple. Infact it is reversed. I seem to be horny ALL the time. I was never this bad and it is HORRIBLE. I can honestly masturbate as many times as I want but it makes no difference its a real inconvenience. And I dont even have to be thinking about anything sexual and its harder than building a wall around mexico. Obviously when I was younger and puberty was more present it happened but im 19 in 5 months. also been eating ALOT and not sleeping well. Advice? 
Hey guys I was on here maybe a couple months ago talking about my depression. I thought If I just stopped thinking about it and ignored it I would maybe feel different so I got off this site and just stopped participating in talking about my problems. I need help. I don't know what to do NOTHING is helping me I cry so damn much every single day and I'm not here. I tell my mom that I want to go to the doctor but I know if I tell her why she will tell me I'm being dumb and I'm fine. I didn't want to even wake up this morning I wish I could sleep forever so I don't have to feel this way. I feel dizzy and nauseous all the time. I just got a new job I thought would help me but I'm not mentally there either I just am so out of place here in this world. I feel like I'm not even me I'm not here my mind is so full of thoughts and then My soul feels gone. I'm completely out of it. I'm wasting my life. I am a waste. I make people happy (boyfriend, family) but then I don't feel the same as them at all I am numb. I get sad yes but I don't have any feelings anymore just thoughts. Body is in auto pilot. I don't know what's going on and I don't know what to do. Someone please help me. Any responses at all would be amazing. Thanks guys.  
Hi, i have severe depression with anxiety, my doctor referred me to a psychiatrist, however I don't want to see the psychiatrists, I don't feel they are helping me in any way. I'd rather go back to my own GP as I feel more  comfortable with my doctor.   My question is can the psychiatrists and their doctors force me to keep seeing them?  I don't feel they listen to me or seeing them is benefitting me in any way. I want to carry on with the medication but I just don't want to have to see them. I want to go back to my own doctor.  
Slept badly took 5mg diazepam to try and relax, waking several times, bad dreams, then waking thinking someone was in my bedroom, (there wasn't). It's my birthday today, 1st birthday that my mother is not here, 2nd birthday my Auntie(my mums twin sister) is not here, 3rd birthday that my husband is not here as it was our wedding anniversary all on the same day.I knew it was going to be a hard day. stayed in bed supposedly the safest place to be but dreadful thoughts of the left over antidepressants I;ve got in the drawer a good mixture of types and dosages, the Dr only allows me 4 diazepams a week now too after taking quite a few in a state of distress, so what would happen if I took them all? Got upset, well very distraught, Samaritans were rung, told of the plans I had where I was planning to go a water filled quarry up in the hills but I can't as i had arranged to go out to dinner this evening with my son, his wife and grandchildren as a distraction as I knew I'd hate today. Cried as I received a lovely gift from a friend of photos in a book of a trip we did earlier in the year, then cried no sobbed my heart out after a gift of beautiul bright sunflowers from my sister. When meeting at my sons house a lovely decorated card from my grandchildren covered in kisses and lovely hugs from them they both sat either side of me at the restuarant. So why can't I accept this love and caring and get rid of these awful thoughts of doing myself in and leaving these people who care. It makes me hate myself even more than I hate myself already does that make sense.  I just want all this s***** to go away. The professionals all say I'm doing all the right things and carry on but the fights in my head just won't go away. I'm scared that one day I will succeed with the risks I take with drugs, alcohol and self harming. Moan over, cheers happy birhtday to me!!!!!! 
For the past few months, I have noticed a change in me. I am usually known for being a super positive person, but I started to go through life with a negative outlook. I find myself losing friends constantly, crying multiple times daily without a specific reason, and dreading each day. I pretend to be happy around other people in public, like when I'm at school, and sometimes I'll even feel a little burst of happiness and think I'll be okay. But before I know it, the process just repeats.  I have told a couple of my friends, but nobody thinks it's that serious. Some have told me they're sad too, or it's going to be okay, but they don't realize the severity of the situation. I have thoughts about suicide often, but they tell me I'm just going through a rough patch. It makes me feel as though I'm being dramatic about the situation and need to stop telling my friends how I feel. I am too nervous to mention it to my parents or my doctor.  I just don't really know what to do anymore. 
Since starting on Mirtazapine I've noticed that not only do I get water retention but my bladder feels sore after I have peed. Anyone else get this.?  Val 
Hello everyone, I'm dealing with loss of feelings and emotions. First off, I was put on Lexapro for anxiety about a year ago. About a month on them I met an amazing guy. I was head over heels in love with him. I loved being with him and when he wasn't around I would dream about him. Everything was so perfect. I decided to get off my anxiety meds and quit cold turkey, which I know is bad but I thought i could handle it. And about a month into my withdrawl something changed. I woke up one morning and it's like he was a stranger to me. I couldn't access the love I had felt for him that year or feel anything. It's been 4 months since then and I'm just devasted. I pray and hope that it's part of the withdrawl and my brains just trying to get balanced back. I KNOW how I felt about him and now feeling nothing just kills me. I don't understand how I just woke up like this one day. Has anyone else had any of these lack of emotions/feelings after taking or withdrawing from an antidepressant?  
I'm 26. Female.I have this problem since I was 13. At the beginning, it would stop once I have a No.2, and then it happens every moment! I don't feel sick or anything uncomfortable physically. But it tortures me mentally! I'm afraid to go out by myself , every time someone says something about fart it makes me nervous! I can't concentrate at studying! I used to be a outgoing person! Now I just want to stay home! I feel lucky there's  still someone willing to be my friend. But I've never discussed my problem with them I feel embarrassing! It makes me feel bad because I know they're suffering from me! After I moved to the other country,  I was seeing this boy and wanted to be honest to him before we got into a relationship! "I never noticed that ! "He said, I started getting confused!  At work, I finally opened up with one of my coworkers, she said the same thing!  But I'm sure people think that I'm stink! Because everytime I walk pass people, they will put their fingers under their nose or cough! And I also hear one of my coworkers said, it's gross to work around me! when I discussed my problem with my manager, she told me nobody noticed my problem and everyone worry about me ! But the thing is nobody willing to work with me or talk to me or be my friends at work!! I feel so desperate!  I've tried almost everything!  
Well, hello. I kind of myself know what I should do, but can never bring myself to do it, at least not in a consistent manner, so maybe you have some suggestions, something that has helped you, for example-or if you know it has helped someone else. Not sure where to start, so I'll start with my childhood. I have an older sister, who is rather an introvert, very logical and was always into books and literature, movies and games..yeah, so generally everything that makes you smart. She had cool friends. My parents too are educated. Me, on the other siide...as I was a child I grew up with my smart sister and got used to the joking and stuff. I was always very stupid tho, very unflexible. I always followed my sister around and was annoying to her. I never recall really..any clear feelings as I was a child..hell, i don't even remember nearly any feelings...or thoughts. So I feel very inadequate and empty, especially when I look into my past. And so as I walked around with my sister and her friends and generally simply was there and did what she did..Like, she'd watch sth on english and I too would, I never really had to make any decisions in my life, you see..I never also learned to have any friends. But you see..even as I was there with my sister..I never felt really there..I've noticed, after like 2 years of having problems and kind of observing myself (unsuccessfully..and really, I think like SUPER slowly) that I am generally very unaware of my surroundings and not really interested. And now we are coming to my problem-I am stupid. But, on the other side, I feel helpless. Now, but let me tell you why I am, because I've come to realise there is a reason about Everything in this life, so after looking a long time at the possible reasons...Well, my mother always helped me, you see, with studying as I was a child. I never really had to learn to ask the teacher or my classmates, because mom would be there, right? So I became a mute girl, kind of. Btw, I'm 16 now, strugging with high school in a different country, since we moved last year, germany, to be precise, and since my mom still is there (but haha, not my dear old sister, who studies now abroad game developing..well, she did, as you can see, something in life..but what about her stupid little sister? Well, she feels hopeless and helpless so asks random people on the internet. Let's hope it helps..somehow) since my mom still is here..she kind of pushes me still a bit..But here is the problem why I feel so helpless-I can't get motivated. On top of that, I am pretty negative, and well, stupid and undeveloped, as you can see, so it feels impossible for me to do anything. But let me also explain to you why-I have ALWAYS given up, about anything..brushing my teeth regularly? Naah. Exersising? Nope, just a week here and then 5 months nothing. Trying to be polite? Ok, 2 days and then nothing. It's like I can never motivate myself and after trying..well, not A LOT of times, but eh, I can say that I simply lose..focus of my goal, but then, even when I try and force myself to think about it AGAIN..I just don't care anymore. And want to die.(Ok, the dying part only since about a year now, and while some may say I have depression, I don't honestly think so. I elieve I am nothing that could POTENTIALLY develop into something, but never would because of stupidity and inconsistency..And then I feel disconnected from everyone and everything and feel like killing myself..that's that, but I don't feel like that ALL the time, perhaps on average, like a few hours a day and even that with breaks. I still laugh tho, I enjoy doing stuff. So you see, I am not depressed. In order to be depressed, I believe, one ought to have higher mental abilities up there, AND btw,someone may see now what I am writing and say I am smart because I have realised it. No. It took me TONS of time, you've no idea. I have rehersed this nearly every day for about a year now. So no, I am not smart. ) And this is the problem as I see it now. Things have been always done for me, by my sister or mother and I have also refused to learn due to..idk, being not smart, so I never learned stuff like focus or motivation, social skills, etc. Btw, I forget really A LOT, can't organise myself much, buy food and things impulsively, don't think about the concequences of sth and act stupidly, am not interested in knowledge (i guess older info is absend and i also remember awfully) , don't really have ANY meaningful relationships, feel empty kind of sometimes and like dying, but then again, am positive at some other times of theday, but can NEVER do anything like a new habbit for more than 3 days on average. Ah, self-discipline. And now it all feels so hopeless because there are so many stuff to do and decide and you have to be self-motivated and have grit, and and and...Any ideas? Or am I perhaps a little retarded or sth? Since I've also thought about that... 
Has anyone ever experienced a mild depression? And am I even suffering from depression at all? I don't feel particularly sad, but sometimes I cry to my boyfriend about feeling numb. Things do make me happy- but sometimes I don't see the point in life. If that makes sense. I took a philosphy class last semester and i think that really messed with my head and my beliefs. I question almost everything and nothing can convince me that I have purpose. Sounds awful- I'm 19 and have never thought this way until more recently.  I also had my mom pass away when I was 16- i think that opened me to the reality of death.  Am i just having trouble adjusting to college and becoming an adult?  Has anyone ever experienced this and gotten over it?  
Hi, have suffered from anxiety/depression for 20 years now.  I feel so so alone all the time or most of the time. My kids are 18 and 20 now and dont need me as much,my wife is disabled and  sleeps alot of the time. I spend alot of time on my own and to be  honest i dont like myself at all. I have tried to go out a little bit more but i could be in a room full of people but still feel alone. I dont  seem to have any friends,i have no confidence,i have it seems every form of anxiety going,just dont want to be here anymore. I  dont know what to do,sorry to go on  
I've increased my prozac from 20 mg to 40 mg and I'm noticing my increase of energy and the want to do more which i love but making sure it's normal to feel like this. A little more anxiety than normal and i wake up at night but i take them at night so maybe that's the problem.. Any ideas?  
Hey everyone!!  I was just wondering can depression make it somewhat hard to speak and cracking/stuttering as you try to speak.   I find that speaking for me takes enormous effort and energy to get the words out, seems like my brain is so depressed that even speaking is labored.  Basically it just feels like I have no energy to speak at all and mumbling as I'm speaking due to the lack of mental energy.  I just wanna know if this is a common problem and I'm not dealing with something more sinister.   I also have focusing problems as well but the speech issues is what I'm worried about the most.  Please offer insights!!! Thanks.  
Hello Guys,   Is there anyone here who was able to get rid of depression with their own efforts?   Looking forward to your reply. 
I don't really know were i am suppose to start all this sorry   So i'm just looking for peoples opinions so would be amazing if some people can share there thought.  I'll start by explaining the chain of events that led to this. So at the age of 12-13 was when i felt this the first time. I joined my first secondary school were after about 6 months i didn't have many friends at all maybe 1-2 but i was fine with that but that was intill they turned on me and starting trying to " fit in with the cool kids ". Other people ofc didn't like me in the " cool kid group " so rumours were made about me and people started spreading stuff. After about 1-2 months i lost the only people i could call " friends ". Then i became the punching bag for pretty much everyone i don't really wanna get into it but i had to leave that school at the end of the year. So time summer breaks comes to a end and i join a new school this time hoping to make new friends. Well thats not what happened at all, at the start of the year i was nice to everyone and really trying to make friends. Again nobody seemed to care and i was on my own again. Walking around at breaks on my own and sitting in class on my own. I felt like a outcast to everyone but this was the easy year because when i hit 14-15 i was targeted yet again but this time much worst. People would follow me calling me names and yet again i was everyone punching bag. It even got to the point were i lost complete control and threw someone againts a wall because he slapped the back of my head but i let him go instantly and said sorry but his group still ran up to me pushed me down and kicked me . So at 16 i left that school with no grades or anything now i'm 19 just got into college trying to get my grades. Same thing with college i have 0 friends nobody even knows my name. Everyone has there groups again and i have nobody at all. What makes things worst is i have many friends online that i talk to everyday and they help alot ( i havn't told them about my depression or anything ). I just broke up with my girlfriend aswell i was e dating her but we just wasn't right for each other. We was dating for a few months and it was the only time i didn't feel alone anymore but now its right back to that feeling and i don't think i can take that again. I cut myself a few times its becoming a normal thing now i do it every other day because the pain is just so bad inside. I just don't see light at the end of the tunnel and i'm thinking of ending it all i just don't wanna do anything anymore i just wanna sleep and never wake up. There is alot more problems but honestly its 5am and i got to sleep.  I just need some help so if anyone cares it would be amazing if you could help me please.  
Hello I'm new to all this! Where do I start....at the begining!? I met my now husband 12 years ago, it was a whirlwind Romance we met in the November and we're engaged by the February we married 16 months later. We have been very lucky in our relationship it has always been a mutual attraction, we have never doubted our love. I have always been inspired by his drive and determination, he worked hard and played hard..he has always been a drinker. He could light up a room with his laughter, the heat and sole of any party.  But a few years ago he started to suffer from the onset of depression  (not that I know it then) and back in March he hit his crisis point braking down and hitting rock bottom he admitted he added been drinking a bottle of whisky a day. we have 3 children 5, 2 and 1 and a tenant farm to run. I  persuaded him to come with me to  see the Dr and he is now on Meds which are working he is also seeing a counselor. The depression I can deal with, I get it, I have been looking after the farm and the children for a few months and that's fine it's what he needs to get better than I'm there doing it. but what I can't deal with is the drink! He has cut down loads and is now only drinking a pint or 2 a day BUT that pint can hit him quite hard and he is still using it as a crutch. I can not get him to stop. he says it's part of who he is, he enjoys it (he has little other enjoyment) it's what farmers do! But I see the effect it has on his mood, behavior his depression I know if he just sees it as part of the problem he would get better so much quicker but he just has ever justification under the sun why he shouldn't give it up completely. Am I being unfair? I know he has come so far from this time last year but I'm worried he will never truly get over this if be don't admit he is dependant on alcohol.  
I'm actually finding out that I'm in the near-suicidal zone because I almost attempted suicide. When I'm around my friends I tell jokes and smile just to hide the pain. Apperantly I'm in a case is serious depression but I can't figure out how to bring it up with my family. Today, I had to do rolls in pe, so I kicked my head as hard as I could, and then during cartwheels I bent my wrist completely sideways. I realized what I did just as the pain registered, so like five seconds after. I keep worrying what I'll do to myself next.        It started last winter, but it was mild up until a month ago, when I suddenly was too miserable to sleep but to tired to try in school. Presently I am failing math and not in any activities because I can't bring myself to consider anything. When I attempted to tell someone, I told my sister who said I was exadurating big time. I looked up symptoms, and I fit most of them. I've lost my appetite but somehow gained weight. I loved lasagna, but now it seems devoid of flavor. I know that I need help, but I'm scared to ask. I don't know what to do and what caused this. My lack of knowing has been driving me insane, so to speak. I'm socially awkward, and my ex is worried about me. I'm 12 so I have no idea if I'm supposed to be like this or not. I find myself listening to the saddest music I can find. What do I do?  
Hey,  After an evaluation at a psychiatrist, I got described to take Cymbalta Duloxetine 30 mg for my depression, OCD. Cymbalta Duloxetine has worked fine for me in the past during a 6 month period.  Will it work in the same positive way again? Any experienced of taking Cymbalta Duloxetine 30 mg?  My blood sugar levels are perfect atm. Also my blood pressure is stable by taking blood pressure medication. So the depression is not diabetes related in this case, that i know for sure.  Im afraid to try out due to serious side-effects. GP says the worst side effects should appear during the first 2 weeks, if any.  Any experience? 
I am a 25 year old who has suffered with depression since I was around 15. It got worse after childbirth and developed PND. My daughter is turning 5 and still suffering with depression and anxiety which has gotten worse over the years. Have tried citalopram and fluoxitine, neither of which worked. I have also tried sertraline which made me have awful hallucinations and mirtazipine which made me gain 4 stone in 4 months! After giving up on medication for a few months and regretting it, I have been prescribed venlafaxine  and I am worried about the side effects as I seem to suffer badly on any medication I take. Has anybody got any advice on how to deal with them. I have taken my first tabletime this evening. I am on 37.5mg twice daily. Thank you      
I've never joined a forum before so this is my first. im hoping to hear some good advise that is hard for me to find. I moved away from my home town and moved states away. I struggled for 4 years went through hell and back but was happy. I left my home town due to family issues and a divorce. Being back and fouth for holidays and doctor visits the family situation has become better. However i have established my own little family with my puppies and my pups live with there puppy papa in another state while im back in my home town due to a knee injury. i am extreamly greatful for my family understanding and taking me in during my difficult time but im 28 years old and i have to share a room with my father while my sister and her son have there own room and a spare bedroom but is my sisters "office" which is just her junk room. Every time i come into town i help my father with our family business and am there about 95% of the time working. The reason why i am looking for advice is because i battled depression for 13years and overcame it when i left my home town and my divorce was done. I loved living on my own and enjoying my own independence. I have yet to have any time for myself and just want to cry as i miss living by the water and waking up happy. I just wake up so angry i just want to cry. I want to find work but i have my father beg me to help him at his office everyday since ive landed in town. The rest of my family doesnt want to have any part of the business, they just want the money. I miss my little family and want to go back to my "home" but my travel companion is wanting to move on and either give my dog away or just give me everything back and since my father will not allow animals in his home he said i will not be able to stay. With possibly going through knee surgry i will have issues working. I just dont know what to do, if any body has any advice my ears are open to hearing anything and everything.  Thank you for anyone that takes the time to read my little story. 
Today is my birthay...and i am alone in my flat contemplaiting suicide. A few days ago i lost my job..over something that was not my fault. I always let people step on me to avoid problems. Now im here wondering how I am going to pay my rent. I have no one and i am undocumented and no one will hire me that way. I have no family , no boyfriend ..and soon no house..Everyday i told myself tomorrow will be a better day ....or next month it will be better....next year will be my year.....but its not. Better yet this year will be my last year. There will be no one who misses me. I am convienced when i leave this world i will perhaps have a better afterlife in another world. I am finally ready to go I cant bare this loneliness and feeling completely worthless... 
My name is Katie and I'm 17. This has been on my mind for a long time now but I'm too scared to speak to anyone face to face at the moment because I think they mighy think I'm being dramatic. I think I'm depressed and I don't know whether to go and see my GP. I have felt this way since I was about 14/15 and can't remember feeling any different since then. I just feel hollow and almost empty, I don't even feel sad anymore just emotionless. At times it is worse for example when I get into arguments with my parents but apart from that I just feel the same every single day and it is so tiring. I feel mentally exhausted from doing nothing, if that's possible? I also feel so so tired all the time and feel as if I have absolutely no energy whatsoever. I'm currently studying for my A levels and this means that I have quite a lot of free periods. I spent these at home sleeping if I can. All I want to do is sleep. I also have quite bad skin and this makes me feel disgusting and not want to even get out of bed, brush my teeth, wash my hair and go to school. When I am in school and around my friends I feel slightly better than when I am at home, I can get along with them and try not to be moody. At home I hardly speak and when I do it's either being moody towards my mum and being unintentionally mean to my sister. This all makes me feel very guilty. I also have a boyfriend of 2 years and I don't feel as excited/happy when I go to see him anymore, I have completely lost interest in having sex and I feel this may also be due to be feeling very fat and ugly. I always question why he is with me or why he likes me when I am so ugly. I don't know what to do. I have so much more to say but I've said the main things that are causing me problems. This is interfering with my life, I have an ambition to become a psychologist but that means going to uni and that means getting good grades. Good grades need motivation, energy and a good frame of mind yet I'm completely lacking in these things. Please help I'm almost dep separate now  
They say that when you hit the bottom the only way is up, but what if there is no bottom? .... Depression/mental illness is a bottomless pit! A pit of tears, blood, pain, fear and hatred, it's dark yet you can still see the images of all the bad things in life, past and present, it's scary, it's lonely, it's full of pain and anguish yet it's also full of emptiness.... I'm broken!  Did the fall break me or was I already broken inside?  Regardless of all this i feel a strange sense of comfort being here, it's familiar, it's what I know and to an extent what I understand, it's the "norm" for me.  To try to climb out is an even scarier thought! As to get the top, to get out only awaits more fear, fear of the future and the bad things that haven't happened yet, things I wont understand, things I won't be used to!  Depression is completely unforgiving it's torture, it's mean, it's cruel! But in a way to me it's also a comfort...better the devil you know right? I guess that makes me sound crazy? Well maybe I am? I am "mentally ill" after all! Or maybe I'm not ? Maybe, just maybe........I'm just me!  
Ugh i am at work and feel rotten. So not in a good place today!  Had a bad day yesterday and my mood has spiralled from there.  Anxiety and Depression is not a good combination together and although i was coping i really was not yesterday, after an argument with the OH he really made me mad by bringing up things that were not my fault and it really hurt. Clearly he doesnt understand my problems and never will i guess. 
Hi all, bear with me as this may take a lot of explaining.  I really need some help. I am a 22 year old who has just recently started a Master's degree. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety in the second year of my undergraduate degree, partly due to undergoing an awfully messy and horrendous breakup, and partly due to the extreme stress and hard work that my chosen degree entailed. After some counselling with the university and then some on the NHS, as well as a prescription of propanolol, I started to feel better. This was around July 2015.  After I started to get better, I was able to form a new relationship with my current partner. We've now been together a little over a year. I graduated in July 2016, and I had an amazing summer doing a great deal of enjoyable things. I also gained about a stone in weight. I've always had self esteem issues and a severe lack of confidence, and my mother and grandmother place a great deal of emphasis on being physically attractive. Therefore, this has recently led to some fights and disagreements about my weight and how I should look. As well, I have been fighting more and more with my partner, whereas before we did not have many serious fights.  I recently started my Master's, as I stated, and lately I have been feeling the way I felt last year. Now I am often unable to get out of bed straight away, I feel what I can only describe as an empty, hollow feeling, I am crying a lot, and also stress eating. I can't sleep at night and when I do I have a lot of nightmares. Even the smallest things set me off crying. I've always been sensitive, but this is a lot worse than before. I can't focus, and I dread coming home to my parents. I want to escape, but I can't for financial reasons. I am fighting a lot with my parents. As a person, I've always been lonely and enjoyed my own company. As a result, this has given me stunted communication skills. I am not close enough to my parents to discuss problems I have with them. There have been cases when I've told my mam things and she's told my dad even though I asked her not to, so I've just always kept to myself.  Another point worth noting is that I work part time in retail. Normally, I don't let myself get stressed at work, since I only work there part time, and I am a good worker. However, the manager of the shop is a bit of an arse. I imagine this is probably the case with most people who manage shops. Lately she has been worse than usual with the festive season approaching. She's one of those people who you don't know how they are going to treat you as it's dependent on what mood she is in.  I think I am just overwhelmed with all that is happening at the minute. I feel so awful everyday, I feel down, I feel like I am hitting rock bottom. I don't like that the way I feel is impacting my relationships with the very few people in the world that I allow to be close to me. I always push people away, and I'm doing it now, though I don't want to. The obvious solution is to talk to a professional, so I've put myself in correspondence with the university counselling team at present. Of course, it may be awhile until I get a response. I just thought I'd post here on the off chance that spilling my feelings out would be cathartic. Has anybody else ever been in a similar scenario? If so, please offer me any advice you can. Or advice in general would be really helpful to me.  If you stuck through this whole post, I salute you. 
For as long as I can remember i've had anxiety. Recently the anxiety is slowly transforming into crippling depression. I can't deal wit this anymore, i dont want to live like this anymore. I dont understand why i feel like this though, i have everything. Family, friends, home, food bt i just can a reason to keep going.  My psychiatrist recommended anti-anxiety and anti-depressients but im really scared to go on them. It's runing the relationship between me and any other person. I dont want to do this anymore, it's really hurting. Please help me. 
Hi   This is my first post. I was diagnosed with severe depression 2 years ago and got help and started taking Meds..... which I am still taking. I started to feel better as i moved in with girlfriends parents as my home life was causing my depression to get worse...  However im starting to slide right back down in to the bottom of depression hole and can't get out.. I love my girlfriend as she is the main reason I started to feel better. However her living here with her parents is causing me just to slide right back.   I'm only 21 and I can't afford to buy or rent and can't move back with family.... I really stuck any help or advise would be great.  Thamks

Has anyone had any experience with MAOI antidepressant medication, either pills or the new patch? I am aware there are dietary restrictions, but I would happily never eat cheese or drink wine again if the stuff would help me feel better. 
So i am trying to become a better person than i am now , but the problem is that i do keep thinking about things and i am getting really frustrated.  For example some mistakes i am used to do:  The easy things i make them difficult. I always find excuses for when there is the time to start doing things. I never achieved anything and i am wondering why now?   There is times that i am in good mood but there is times i am in bad mood. I want to control myself and not getting distraction.  I am just looking for a solution to my problem i don't want to get depressed or feeling pressure for doing what i want to do.     
About 4 years ago my family was forced to move from USA to the UK. My family and I have always travelled so when my parents said we would settle in America, I felt more relaxed and 'at home'. Then certain circumstances caused my family and I to move to the UK and like any normal person I missed my friends, school and life. However since I had moved numerous times before; I thought I'd just move on as usual. Due to me being shy I was friendless for a year when we moved back to the UK before making a small group of friends (4 or 5) in my second year at the new school. Years on, I believe I still haven't recovered from the circumstances that caused our move as it was tragic and a very difficult time. I have the opportunity to visit America again in the summer but I fear that if I go back, spend time as I used to; when I return home from my visit, I will become depressed once again. Or will the visit help to heal my emotional wounds? Any insight and opinions are greatly appriciated so THANK YOU!  P.S Are your high school years your best years or does the world just get better? 
I left my abusive husband 5 years ago  I lived with my mum for 7 weeks then she had a very bad accident brain injury horrific she was in hospital for 4 months, in the mean time my two sons are living with me in her 2 bedroomed flat as I was going hospital every day husband cut off all monies as he is controlling, mum came home and I nursed her for 12 months, she was a miracle done very well considering but still had a brain injury which is hard to cope with, met a few men fell in love but didn't work out as my time was with my mum so much,  joined gym to help the endorphins met a nice man who I wouldn't normally go for but he was a gentleman, got own place moved out with my both sons as it was cramped and got careers for mum and myself and sister done the rest.mum got cancer total shock and was so quick, she died within 8 weeks of us knowing.. I'm struggling like hell now feel so down hate my life some days could just end it all, my memory is awful and I feel I'm forgetting words, been to a councillor for 8 weeks she says it's a process on anti depressants now for a long time having a bad day today lost my faithful dog 6 weeks ago,  had problems with my both boys feel everything is in my shoulders just feel so tired and very very low.. 
I have been dating this guy for a short time (6 months) and I had never been so happy. He had invited me over to family events, we never fight, I really like him. Recently, one day he just didn't talk to me all day then the next day he sends me a text messgae and breaks up with me. Tells me he is depressed and needs time alone to sort himself out and to get back on his medication. I was very confused because I didn't know he suffers from mental illness but I did a ton of research and I was very understanding and told him I support him and I am here for him when he needs me. Since, he told me he is depressed because he is still in love with his ex girlfriend (who cheated on him and wasnt kind) but then he flipped out on me and accused me of sleeping with other people because I didn't talk to him for a day? Is this normal behavior? I am not sure what to do.. should I stick around and give him his space? Or, leave the relationship entirely? I'm not sure if he is actually in love with his ex or if he was saying that because he wanted me to leave him alone? Or, does a depressed person go back to people who treated them poorly and don't think they deserve love? I am so confused and any input would be helpful. 
I'm not sure if I'm really depressed but it feels that way. I'm 18 years old and have been dealing with a barking cough that later brought on a lot of anxiety for about a year. What happened was a year ago I got sick with pneumonia. I wasn't hospitalized but I began having a lot of problems after my pneumonia cleared up. I made the mistake of trying to go back to tennis and running two weeks after I had pneumonia ( I was an athlete). I couldn't breathe so I was forced to stop. For a couple of months it got so bad I couldn't walk up the stairs because i was out of breath all the time. It was hard to concentrate at school and my friends were worried because I looked really pale. My parents took me out of school for two weeks to take me to a hospital in Denver so I could get testing done because the doctors at home said nothing was wrong with me. During my time there I figured out the source of my breathing problems were due to dysfunctional breathlessness. 3 months of breathing exercises and my breathing problems were almost completely gone. I was now left with a barking cough that was embarassingly loud, hurt, and made me dizzy and breathless if went on too long. The thing that makes me the most mad is that if i didn't have severe tmj problems, I probably would've stopped coughing a while ago. They put a PH probe in me down in Denver and I tried so hard to tolerate it but I couldn't. My tmj made it feel like the probe was a knife cutting into my jaw and was so painful they had to take it out 3 hours in because I couldn't stop screaming in pain. Many many tests later and the only thing I've managed to find is that I have antibodies against my bird and my endoscopy showed I have esophagitis and gastritis. I thought finding something would put my mind at peace but it hasn't. They said give the Meds three months but time has made the worst of me. It's almost November and I withdrew from college for a year because I was having a hard time. The biggest problem is, I was due to have tmj surgery a while back but I keep pushing it back due to my problems. . My jaw has been hurting for many years now and getting locked so I was ready to get it fixed ( plus I am super self conscious about my pushed back jaw and braces) but then I got sick. It's going to take a while to recover from that as if I weren't scared enough. The time I have between now and college just isn't enough. I hate feeling so trapped and I have to listen to how much fun my friends are having in college and how normal their lives are everytime I call. Three friends go to school nearby and I go see them sometimes but there have been many times they've invited me out that I say no because I'm so sad and tired of dealing with my symptoms. They all think that I've been better for a while because I don't want them to know about what I'm going through. Every time I hangout with them I have to pretend I'm ok when I'm not and it's become exhausting. Now they don't invite me unless I invite myself because of how many times I've turned them down because I'm too upset To go out. Now I'm going to have no friends and that makes me feel even more isolated. I'm given opportunities to go out and I want to but I don't want to and it doesn't even make sense. I try to still play tennis for at least an hour but it's not the same. I miss the strong independent girl who would.  Compete and train for hours before everything happened. I miss the happy girl who was ready to tackle the world and go to college. I've been shy all my life but I began to come out in highschool and now I feel I am back to square one. Like I'm the worst and most vulnerable version of myself. My friends think im living this glamorous life style but I use it as a cover to protect myself. I don't remember what it feels like to be normal. I miss traveling. I've been at home for so long I miss learning. I see a big blank for my future and hate myself for it. It's hard to get myself to want to do anything anymore and applying for college housing makes me cry because I feel like I won't get the opportunity to go. Many doctors have told me I'm crazy. My parents cry because they don't understand. It's just a cough, go on with your life it will get better. I try to describe how I feel but they don't understand. I feel like I'm heading down emotionally now. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. 
I'd like to know what people think of ECT and hear about their negative and positive views and especially their expiriences  resulting from  actual therapy.  I've  read   about how It can benefit depression and other maladies  from the professional viewpoint BUT I'd like to hear from the PATIENT directly. (I'm not a professional, just an interested person who has a son that has been and continues to be treated with ECT )  I'm really worried that it is performed too much and touted as a great therapy. ( I am very skeptical) I'm worried about the adverse effects that have been reported and are they long term ? There and many professionals that greatly support ECT. But there are also Doctors warning of the greave risks associated with this procedure .  Peoples thoughts and views please.  Thanks for your time.     James B.  
I am now 29 years old, with a boyfriend I love so dearly and is very good, supportive and respectful to me, but I have no sex drive and still have issues with anxiety and depression I try to solve. Here is my story, and I am hoping for your advice as I do not know what to do.  Early last year, I ended a destructive relationship (he was violent but did not physically hurt me), family members took their life (we have depression running in the family and I have lost a few to suicide which I was very close to), I was bullied at work, later resigned, and ended up in the end this spring of 2016 with the diagnose depression/anxiety and started to avoid everyone, both family and friends and I did not leave home. I had no income and it quickly got expensive to not have a job which was an added stressfactor to add to the nothingness I was now feeling.   A few years previous, I was known to be the most sparkly and happy person around and was often referred to as "sunshine!" for spreading positive energy. That was not me anymore though. Now I was a robot with no feelings at all. I also started to lightly think about suicide.  At this point, I reach out for help to my parents, and given the family history they immediately took me under their wings and had me move into their house as they did not want me to be isolated alone and thinking about suicide.  I spent a few months in their house, tried a couple of psychologists but did not find a good one, I also tried some medication for my anxiety buy that only made me nose anxious so I stopped taking them, I also took medication to enable me to sleep, but they did not work as they only made me restless and not able to sleep, so I stopped taking them.  I am now sort of self medicating and came across this website, thought I would reach out to like minded people.  I am now trying my best to be in a loving relationship, but as I have not sorted out all my messy past, I still have difficulties feeling some of the basic feelings: like sex drive. I am now worried and anxious that my boyfriend will leave me as I am unable to express such a simple thing as sex. I want to have sex with him, but my body does not respond to what I used to like.  Anyone who can relate to loosing basic emotions like this? I could really use some help!   
I haven't posted for a while having stopped taking Citalopram in May this year. I was trundling along OK until I went to see my GP with a skin complaint. While I was there he INSTRUCTED me to have a flu jab, presumably because I am of a certain age. I have NEVER had flu in my life so I declined his 'offer', he was very sniffy about this so to appease him I had it. Since that day nearly 2 weeks ago I have had the most horrendous depression, suicidal thoughts, non stop crying and anger outburstsn - absolutely awful, really really awful. I had acupuncture yesterday and I feel a lot better today - fingers crossed. I don't know if the flu jab was responsible but I believe it was, so I am warning anybody out there to give serious consideration if offered this jab. Take care all 
I have had a fairly positive couple of weeks and this week everything has just come piling back down & feeling as bad as ever.   My relationship is being affected, my social life is being affected, and I can't get out of this rut.   I can't even remember what I was like before depression but I long to be back to my 'normal self'. All I want is to feel happy and normal again.   I just can't stop crying and thinking how worthless  
I have suffered from depression for 3 years. I'm now having sucidal thoughts over the past 3 weeks. I'm looking for an impatient mental health rehab centre. There are a few I've found just searching online but I don't want to get ripped off, or not the best help possible. Please help, if anyone has any recommendations! 
Can I ask people here to say if therapy, Counselling, etc has not worked for them?  I'm not really looking to hear from people who say give it time or you haven't met the right one yet. I want to know if it's at all normal for therapy not to work?   I don't want to go into my personal details here, but for be I've tried many people, with many specialties over about 4 years now. And also tried a couple about 10 years ago. And in any of these. I've not once gotten any benefit.  In fact it's the opposite. Any time I get myself together and go to therapy, I always, every single time fall off the wagon and self harm. My doctor and anyone I've spoken to cannot understand this. They keep saying start small, etc. Trouble is at the moment even if I wanted to try a new one I cannot afford it.   So I'm wondering has anyone else dealt with this?  And did anything change, or anyone suggest anything else?  I'm concerned cos my doctor seems to think talking is the ONLY thing that will make me better in the long term  
Last night like a clown I forgot to take my medications, I have them worked out so I take the drugs that make me sleep like Tramadol, Amytrptalene, Citalopram and several others  What happens in my case I suffer severe waking nightmares and I wake up in the morning like something like the cat brought in.  Sad to say I have to take my night tablets after breakfast and my Statins at lunchtime so I do not mix certain medications. So today has been one big yawn where I have not been able to sleep, and my concentration has been really shot. Pleased to say I am back on track tonight and my Wife Hazel has given me my nightime medications.  The problem I have is I am not trusted with my medications and I have to be given them because of my suicide attempt, and a backslide I took several months ago, The crisis team had been called and I was seen by several Specialists and now I will be seeing my new CPN next week. So walking out the house and disappearing did not do me any good. All I did was walk out on the Crisis Team and did not return after they had waited to see me for two hours. Aparently my wife was supposed to call the Police to find me if I had not returned home by a certain time. Glad to say I was back before the given time so that has caused me further grief.  We can do really strange things when we are feeling low and in a way I had not done myself any favours.  Now I am calm and feeling not so bad, although I am still feeling the backlash. When depressed we can make people who love us so depressed by our actions. We need to think before we jump I suppose  BOB 
I have lost myself to depression and anxiety.  I have become sedentary and talk my husband to take me out - Anywhere.  My mind is stagnant and I only look forward to the night and to sleep.  Don't talk medications, as I've been on them all.  My doctor does not want to see me for a month (to see how the Abilify & Zoloft) work together.  Everything I see or have brings me no joy.  I can bearly look in my closet as it reminds me of someone who is not here.  Shopping gives no thrill nor does anything else.  I am left in limbo - if Zoloft + Abilify don't work and the other meds didn't where do I go from there.  ECT?  Been there and don't want to go there.  It was 10 yrs. ago.  Absolutely barbaric!  Peope suggest yoga, tranquil music, walking - I have tried exercise at the gym and probably will continue.  But, my heart is still heavy!  Sorry for the negativity but that is all I have. 
 Okay,   Bit of a catch 22 situation. I'm about to not have an income for Dec/Jan. I'm looking for part time/holiday jobs but the catch is I have the crumby jobs I have now because my mental illnesses make it difficult for me to get out of my own head space and work productively at a normal 9-5.   I'm supposed to start intensive (DBT) therapy on Monday next week. I really need the therapy, I can see that, but financially I'm not in a good place. What do I do? Do I suck it up, get a holiday job and not deal with my mental issues, or do I stay at home, go to therapy, let the chips fall where they may and pick up work again in Jan? 
I have had the worse four months of my life And I still finding it hard to cope I  found out in July that I have AF a heart problem After becoming ill and so close to having a stroke I spent 5 days in hospital to recover This had been giving me pain for months and been affecting my personal life Me and my partner at the time had been going through a rough patch but being together for 20 years thought we can sort it out During my treatment in July and the following months my partner start to have affair and then told me me she had been seeing someone and was going to move away with him This caused me such stress that it put me back in hospital  I plead with her not to go and come back to me and things will be different. I was in such a mess that I kept breaking down and also did it in front of her but she still went and broke my heart She couldn't of done this at a worse time my heart is still broken and nothing can get her back So sent me texts to say she still cares and wants to be friends but I can't forgive her and I have blocked her from my phone. I moved all her stuff to her mums and tried to get better but the thought of her sleeping with another man makes me worse My house is so empty without her I was replying to her text until a few days ago when I ask for closure as I say to her that I have got to accept that she isn't coming back I have had support from my family and daughter from my first marriage and my ex wife who I left for to be with my partner In fact I have got close to her again mainly because I can see the pain I put her through my heads all over the place and at 57 never thought somebody would do this who you out your trust in and love so much My depression doesn't help but I try to get by Without self harming myself  This as made me so unhappy and confused. 
I'm curious about the benefits of having a loving pet to reduce stress and for piece of mind.  I know some may be allergic to pets for one reason or another, but I would like to hear how members feel about how their pets help them on a daily basis.  Animal Lovers....show me your pets... Just a Hug from them brings peace, love , laughter and lifts my spirits every day.  Some may have horses,dogs, cats,birds, they all bring laughter & joy every day!   Its easy to enlarge the pics.  Can't wait to see yours!!!!    Each one of my animals has a story how they have saved me from falling or just be my legs for a day. All my beautiful furry, feathered angels are here to help us grow and live with what ever our illness. They are always by my side & always add a giggle for the day!      
Hi everyone,      I spoke with my GP earlier an he suggested I join this forum to seek some common group and help from like minded people.  Where to start.  I'm clinically depressed. I have bulimia nervosa. I've had CBT sessions they didn't help. I've recently been on fluoxatine and citalopmine(sp) antidepressants to try control my binge eating.   My GP today wanted to put me back on the antidepressants as I've gone cold turkey. But unfortunately due to financial difficulties I cannot afford the £8.95 prescription.  I've had a crappy 2016. I DID own my own business until my managing director an registered manager decided to both resign on the same day. Unbeknown to me they had procured my staff and contract over night leaving me with about 45k worth of personal debt. then in August I split with my long term girlfriend due to depression etc.  I literally just want to climb under a rock somewhere and never come out. I'm just not sure there's much left worth bothering over  I'm hoping someone has some advice.  Thanks for reading.  Villaboy4life 
Long post, bear with me.  I am a graduate  student and recently started my degree in a new country.     My problem is that I am not able to concentrate on studies.   1. No interest to study despite knowing that it's the only thing I have to do.  2. Feeling sad for apparently no reason and indifferent, dormant feeling most of the times. Complete emotional numbness to literally everything.       Like when I got a part-time job and it's a happy thing for me, but I was like meh and when I was leaving my home country I didn't feel much sad as I thought I would be.  3. Little alteration in sleeping and eating habits and gained some weight.   4. Sometimes (Rarely) sudden jump in mood from sad to happy just for very simple things which I am aware are not that big a deal.  5. Completely insecure that I won't be able to cope up and live up to the expectations which I set up myself and it's making me more anxious.(They are in no way bigger than what I am normally capable of achieving in this type of situations)   6. The most terrifying of all is that when I realized my problems and googled the symptoms, weirdly I felt a little complacent feeling that I got a reason to justify my inability to concentrate on studies by blaming it on a medical issue rather that getting the urge to deal with it.(I know that this is how laziness takes over a persons lifestyle.)This is the reason why I  believed that it's just laziness that's effecting me and I can get over it.(at least I thought so)  7. No suicidal thoughts but had really frustrating episodes when I was unable to perform.      I am in a position where i am in the middle of two different feelings, that I don't need someone's help and at same time I also feel that I cannot deal with it on my own. I did consult a certified counselor at my university and was told that I had some symptoms of depression, anxiety and was asked to track my behavioral patterns for some days to have a better view of the situation.     I am not sad or blue all the time,I do manage to get out of this feeling once in a while and enjoy certain activities with friends and watch a movie something once in a while.Generally when this kinda stuff happens I sit and jolt down all my issues along with the specific reasons for the problem and then try to deal with them, and mostly I do succeed in this kind of things. Right now I am not sure what's taking a toll on me and not able to pin point my issue.  I am not sure whether it's me being  1. Chronically Lazy, due to the fact that I had a couple of months free time before starting my grad school and I am used to being free and not doing things. and maybe I just need to discipline myself much more strictly.   2. Inferiority complex from the peers who are more experienced and knowledgeable than me. (This could be it)  3.. Overwhelming feeling to do it all and the fear to start from the first.  4. Home sickness-- I know this might be a possible thing as I am an international graduate student in another country far from home, but that cannot be the situation as I've been living away from family for past 6 years in my home country.  5. Just the fact that the college life is not similar to what I had in Undergrad or what I expected.  OR   may be considering the fact that all my life things have come to me pretty easily ( with a little less effort than what's normally required) and it pushed me into a comfort zone where I don't get the urge to force myself to study.  In the end I am just not sure whether it's one of the above or all of them have combined and made it overwhelmingly hard on me to understand it clearly.         (Me two weeks ago)      The ultimate problem is that i just don't have a clear picture of what's going and where my life is headed and this is just not how I pictured myself in this endeavor of Masters degree(very important phase of my life).  It's not like I am hopeless about my future as I know and was sure that  when the real-deal situation comes up I can get things done, but this mindset I am having right now is something that's bothering me more. Some of the above mentioned traits are the ones I had for a long term but they never effected my academic life. May be this is not a big deal and I am just looking it in a magnifying glass.        (Me now) Where things took rather unexpected turn     Right now I am not sure that I can handle it. All the above statements and points were my opinion about my condition but everything changed when I had my mid-terms ( of 3 subjects) recently and I just let them pass without putting any fight to study which I was expecting I would be able to exert on myself this time (considering the fact that these are the real-deal situations), and I felt like it wouldn't matter even  if I don't show up to the exam.It's just unacceptable to be thinking that way. It's completely off limits even for the laziest version of me or for anyone else. I am not able to push myself to concentrate no matter what I do.   Now I am really scared of what's going on with me as I am not sure what I'm trying to deal with. Is it just my laziness that has reached to chronically severe levels or am I really depressed or something ??? But I don't have anything to be depressed about. I used to be a happy-go-lucky guy and also have no traumatic past incidents or anything like that.  I am not sad and down all the time in a day or have any self-harm thoughts. I don't think these are the traits of a depressed person , are they ???   Mostly it happens with studies but coming to other day-to-day stuff I don't have this big of issue in getting them done and this is where my conscience is arguing with me that it's just my laziness and procrastination that's effecting me in a colossal way.I am just torn between these arguments of me and my conscience and reached an impasse.I really need an external evaluation of the situation.    I need to know  what's it happening to me here,   Is it me just being melodramatic by looking at things from an extreme point? Or  just the fact that I might be having some medical condition made it hard for me to accept it and I am just blaming my shortcomings? Or  am I just starting to show symptoms of some problem? Or  am I really having any of the issues for real ??? Or  am I simply taking incredibly long time to adjust to a new place??? Or Is it just hypochondriac feeling that's making me feel this way ???   All these confusing thoughts have made it really hard on me to exactly point out what is going wrong here.   In the end I really feel guilty that all this is just some bullsh*t I made up in my mind to satisfy my laziness and stop doing stuff, but it's unbearable for me to fight it off    The reason I am writing all this is that I would really appreciate if any of you people care to give your opinion based on your point of view as to what might be my problem. I am not able to go beyond this stage. It's hard to pin point on my problem or the source of it. Do you really think I have an issue or is it just the combination of certain situations that have thrown me off the norm for a while?   Any and every suggestions are appreciated.   Thanks in advance.   P.S I did make an appointment with the counselor next week.  
I would like to know if unreal side effects, i.e. fear of being alone, not being comfortable in my house - is an effect of depression.  I have developed these phobias over the last 7 months.  I have absolutely no self esteem and just get up in the morning and could care less what I look like.  This is extremely unusual for me as I used to love fashion, etc.  This site is helpful but is there an accredited site where you can get real answers, just not everybody's opinion. 
Ok so im an 18 year old guy, and ive been severely depressed for years, I initially thought it was just a phase and that I would grow out of it, but then I started having extremely suicidal thoughts. This continued for a long time and nothing changed until recently.  On thursday last week, I woke up at 7am with extreme pains in my stomach, I went to the a&e and found out it was appendicitis and that I would need surgery, I was fine with it because I wanted ti be rid of the pain it was giving me. But once I woke up from the surgery I had an emotional awakening, and expressed my suicidal thoughts to the nurses and doctors who were alarmed.   I was made to speak to their mental health professional and told I would need antidepressants. I was givin Citalopram, and told to take it as so as I got home, and was also supervised to make sure I didnt do anything in the hospital.  Since taking the meds that friday, I have been feeling horrible, so many physical and mental health problems due to the surgery and these meds. I am more suicidal and anxious than I have ever been. In the last week ive had maybe 20 hours sleep im so fidgety I feel like everything I do is a bad move and I cant make important decisions. I dont want to eat or sleep or drink I just want to get out of feeling like this, what do I do? Have any of you had amazing success on these meds? 
Today I've been prescribed 50mg sertraline (zoloft) for my depression and anxiety. However, I often take 10mg of metoclopramide for nausea, and apparently there is an interaction between the two which can cause serotonin syndrome.  I think I took metaclopramide about 20 hours ago, as of writing this, can I take the sertraline now, and if not how long will I have to wait before its safe to take it?  
I reduced my Imipramine from 100mg pd to zero over 5 months. Since i went down to zero 4 weeks ago I've had horrible flu-like symptoms.  The best I can find on the internet is that less than 1 in 5 people have these symptoms, most after fast withdrawal rather than the tapered one I did, and that they normally last 1-2 weeks.  I've kept going in the hope that I'll come out the other end, but I now really feel i can't put up with these feelings any longer. Giving in when I was about to succeed would be a cruel blow. Does anyone have any info or experience here?  Surely, many of the millions of people that have been on Imipramine have tried to come off it as I have.  I can't be alone.  My medical situation is a combination of neurological pain, depression and, possibly, hypothyroidism (I have the symptoms and my blood levels are poor, but I'm within official limits for 'OK' and low B12.  I'm self-medicating with B12 & other B vitamins; the start of my flu-like symptoms doesn't link with my supplementing and stopping the vitamins for a while has had no effect.  I tapered off the Imipramine as I was desperately fatigued and sleepy (my get-up-and-go had completely gone) and wanted to eliminate it in the hope that those symptoms were a delayed side-effect (they are listed). 
Hi everyone!  I've been feeling so bad lately that Ive been thinking doctors help might be useful, but I've never spoken to anyone about my mental health before and I keep convincing myself that my "depression" will eventually go away, anyway that's why Id like some advice. . I know the cause of it is over thinking, i constantly over analyse everything little thing I do and happens to me, don't have much self confidence, some days i think I have social anxiety as i dont even like walking on a busy road out of fear that everyone is watching me "walking weirdly" or I fear when a man is walking behind me going to stab or attack me, I feel really shy then other days I feel a bit more normal and confident...it's hard to describe like my mood changes so quickly.. I am ok at controlling it, nobody around me has ever noticed it as I'm good at hiding it.  It's affecting my life, I have done things like move to a different town, move to a different country, randomly leave my job and get another one,like always searching for happiness,thinking my surroundings are the cause but really I think I am the cause.. now I m left in a new town, basically alone, I have a friend 1 hour away and my parents but they are getting old so I'm constantly worried about them. Im currently doing a course so I'm around people all day, laughing with them etc but when I'm home I'm by myself always sad thinking about sad things that have happened and worried, asking myself if I will find a job in this new town. My parents are paying my rent for these 3 months (I am 21 years old, never asked money from them before and they offered to pay my 3 months rent whilst I do this course,I can't live with them as the course is too far away) now I'm constantly feeling guilty about them paying my rent, even though they are ok with money.  Another thing might be important to say,I feel like I've been depressed since a child  (I used to worry the teachers by sitting in corner of the playground by myself not talking to anyone. , by the way I was bought up in a country foreign to my parents so even if I was born here I always felt different talking my language at home). I had a boyfriend when I was 18 and got so upset if I didn't hear from him even for a few hours I would self harm..sounds silly I know. I self harmed a few times but hAve stopped. So I keep telling myself to go and see a doctor. , but I'm soo scared of medication and at the same time I do realise i can't live my life like this.. I keep wondering if I've got mild bordeline personality disorder or just depression, maybe both? Has anyone got any experiences or advice? BTW I'm a 21 year old girl 
I'm a 25 year old woman and I've been on Antidepressants for my Depression since I was 14. I came off the last lot (Mirtazipine) back in april 2011 because I was feeling ready to try life without the meds.   I did fine over summer, wonderfull infact but then Sept/oct rolled around and I had the familiar feelings of disconnection and depression I managd to hold out thinking it would pass untill late November. I decided to see my dr and reluctnantly chose to go back on something.  I refused to go back on Mirtazipine as it had made me gain a TONNE of weight since starting it back in 2008.(I'm talkin 4+ stone!) Also I wanted to be on something I could take whilst pregnant as my husband and I want to start a family next year (hence coming off meds in the first place).... Anyway cut a long story short... I got put on Imipramine 25g a day for a week then up to 75g a day.  OMG within a day or two of taking it I felt worse, I felt more hopless and couldn't stop crying... which I do understand is fairly normal when first starting a drug... it was the other side effects that made me stop after 2.5 weeks. I had panick attacks, crippling Anxiety, heart palpitations, I'd wake with a start in the night covered in sweat, I didn't want to leave the house and I couldn't go to work. I eventually called my gp and we arranged to come back and try something different and thank god I did. I was beginning to think that all the symptoms were just my depression worsening but it was the meds.  I'm now on something different and so far after just a week I am feeling better in myself, no more anxiety, or panic, still have a very up and down mood but I can handle that. Also I've been back to work twice now so I'm getting there.  But yeah all in all imipramine was NOT for me!  :x 
I'm 24 years old, I've had a tough last few years including a miscarriage and break down in my relationship. I was abused when I was 13 years old by a relative. At the beginning of the year I spoke about it and was referred to a mental health specialist but when it came to it I couldn't go and I lied to my mum and said I went. I met a friend who I became really close with, he took my mind off everything and I finally thought I was becoming 'normal' again. A few weeks ago we had a fall out and things haven't been the same since. I feel lost on my own and I'm struggling to sleep and eat, I'm scared to get help because I turned it down in the past. Every night I wake up and just sit and think about ways to end my life without causing too much hurt to my family. How do I stop feeling like this? And make the voices in my head telling me I'm worthless and a freak go away?  
I've been dealing with mdd with pshycotic features for well over a year now I'm 32 and have tried numerous meds that hasn't worked I've decided to stop taking all of them zoloft abilify and trazedone I think I've given this med thing a good try and would like to just be left alone and let fate sort things out  I have a appointment with my pshyc this week and am very nervous if they are gonna let me continue this way or commit me again  anyone have any thoughts as to what I could expect at this appointment 
Been on Cipralex 20mg for about 7 months. Doctor recommended at least a year on it. I do a lot of physical labour around my hobby farm, as well as do some writing and helping my kids with schoolwork, so I do get mental stimulation as well. Gradually getting back to work outside of home, and hopefully regain the sense of contributing to my community. Still occasionally feel overwhelmed, as if in a fog -would just like to disappear. Any idea how/when the weaning is advisable.  
Hi people, I'm 20 years old female and have been to psychiatrist but I'm ashamed to tell him these things... I find myself having very low self esteem and I wish I was more confident like I was few years ago. i can describe myself as a private person and often don't talk with my friends about what I like to watch, listen to or something like that and I have always been this way. But I love people and love becoming friends. My biggest problem is feeling guilty and ashamed. I'm introvert as I said and I like ''talking with google'' and reading a lot of forums about different things, opinions, problems and questions (even if they are weird or have nothing to do with my opinions)... even searched every though that came up to my mind. (like Yahoo Answers, different blogs..) but one day I though of ''What if people can see what I googled ever? Long time ago? Some weird opinions from other people(i don't actually agree with)..? Some random questions? What would they think about me? Maybe they would think I'm bad person for searching things like that... (even the random questions I have searched are NOT what I REALLY THINK about something or agree with, it's just about my curiosity). When this came up to my mind, I became extremly paranoid and feels like eveyone knows what I have looking at or reading or whatever... I have feeling that people hate me all the time and that they know every my step... The worst is feeling that they know some things about me that I don't even know... (i know it's weird but can't help it). Like they know who I truly am but I don't. In reality, my close friends and family knows that I'm not hating anyone, that I'm open minded and wouldn't discriminate anyone in any way, love to helping people... and at the end of the day I know that I am like that. But on the other hand I FEEL like I'm wrong person, because my thoughts can be very weird sometimes and I hate myself for that... I can't forgive myself for my thoughts and questions in my mind that I typed on internet and I know this can be funny to some people, but I feel like everyone knows it and they hate me. Sometimes I'm feeling like I'm not myself and feels suicidal. I have heard that this can be some form of ocd but i don't know because I simply can't get rid of these thoughts, every day I'm waking up with them,falling asleep too, can't concentrate on anything, can't talk with people but not feeling paranoid or anxious or like they hides something from me... I can't live normal life, I feel like I'm losing my mind and I'm avoiding myself happiness in any way. I'm crying every day and when I'm home alone I simply scream and cry... What can I do? 
You could call it anxiety but it feels more like fear.  My depression on sertraline is leaving me with alot of fear.  I am scared to admit this as I try to appear normal but inside I am in turmoil.  I am seeing my PDoc tomorrow and I don't know how to explain this.  One reason may be that he might suggest going off sertraline, which would take time, and going on something else - more time.  I cannot bear to wait as we've been through numerous antidepressants and none work.  It even hurts to go out in public to see others getting on with their life.  My feelings sink  just to observe.  I think I need a psychologist so I can re-train my negative thinking.  When I go out in my car, I end up just driving around not wanting to go home.  Home scares me as I spent alot of time there bedridden.  I do have a caring husband of 44 years.  Or perhaps it's the depression just making a mockery of my life.  Drugs that haven't worked:  Lamotrigine; Effexor; Latuda and presently sertraline (Zoloft).    
Random question set the scene - had a good day yesterday sort of, got up reasonably early even did housework miracle, changed my bed which was stinking as handn;t been done for ages dirty bitch, cried on and off all morning but had arranged to meet with a new work colleague who we both seem to hit it off. Making an effort to be sociable Good 7 mile walk enjoying the scenery, general light hearted chat I was knackered afterwards, during the evening got text message from another friend tried to be supportive, seemed to help. even slept most of the night for a change still weird dreams. Well today? body ached this morning still getting chest problems awaiting another x ray to see if infection gone. Went for a drive bit fast (got a kick from that) but safe, home even cooked meal which is good for me. Then decided  to watch a poor horror film not that horrific really but ended up hurting myself while watching it and getting a kick out of it is that wrong? Sad or mad!! Plus I'm dreading going to work tomorrow so am I subconsiously stressing about that?  
Hi,  First time ever using a forum on mental health. I don't know where to start, I'm curled up in bed atm feeling very empty.  Ever since a kid in school I've always had these episodes that would last for a few weeks to months, throughout the year where I feel really worthless and depressed (if I'm using that correctly). I used to feel like I'd never get anywhere in life or amount to anything and nobody will ever love me etc the usual bad thoughts.  Sometimes it would get so bad I wished I was dead. Note: I would never kill myself and have never self harmed but I had feelings of wanting to be dead or in a coma or something. This was in school too where I have no worries and well life is pretty easy. I used to cry in the shower every day for weeks, then be decent for some months then it would come back. Always felt out of my control and like I was forced to feel that way (mental issues run in my family wouldn't be surprised if I get a depression diagnosis one day).   Anyway fast forward I have been in a bit of an emotionally abusive relationship with a girl who has serious trust issues, anxiety and is pretty bipolar (sorry to anyone who has it but she does have mood swings). We ended it but it's taken its toll on me and it feels as if it's triggered those depressive thoughts and stuff again. Past couple weeks appetite off sleepy most of the day sleeping all day, feeling a panicky awful feeling in my chest constantly and anxiety like symptoms. Which is weird cuz I'm pretty extroverted and confident so it sucks. Feel empty and like I'm in a prison in my mind. Anyone who wants to know more just post and I'll tell you.   Thanks. :3 
So for at least a month now, I've been having nausea... it isn't the worst thing ever and it rarely accompanise gaging or the feeling of throwing up, it just makes me unable to eat or think about anything else. Since I have a terrible fear of vomit as well, Its been a hard month... At first, I thought it was because I ate too much or that I was stressed out, thinking it would pass after a night's rest. Nope... It did go away for a few days during my period but, after I had a panic attack, it came back... I saw my psychiatrist the other day and she said maybe it was IBS or depression (since I'm going to be treated for it)... As I'm writing this, I have a bloated feeling and a burning sensation... I am 14 days into my cycle... I'm desprite at this point since I've become unable to do things I enjoy, eat and even see friends and family without going into panic attacks... Don't even get me started about sleep, its a nightmare Before anyone tells me to see a doctor, I'm only a teenager and my mom has declined my offers to see one for awhile... If anyone has any ideas, please help me. (All symptoms from the past 5 months if curious, the nausea has only recently begun) -Cycles of depression and suicidal thoughts -Stress and Anxeity -Constipation and Diarrhea that fluxs -Nausea -Burping and Gas   
I've been living like this for at least 5 years since my best friend killed himself. However it's been getting much worse. I can hardly read, even typing this is slightly difficult. I have a werid snowy-static like vision with lots of floaters which on top of my lack of concentration makes it difficult for me to read. I used to be a very sharp person, quick witted, etc. Now I struggle to think of which word to use on an hourly basis. I feel like im constantly in a dream, and when I wake up (after typically a 12 hour sleep) i'm so dizzy I have to get up very very very slowly. I wouldn't say i'm exactly "sad" but i'm thinking i'm depressed. Has anyone else been through this and gotten out of it? Doesn't seem like theres much hope, no anti depressants have ever helped me. I've gotten MRI's, every blood test in the book, i've cut dairy and gluten out of my diet (though i was skeptical) and all to no avail. I'm looking to talk to some people who are also going through this, or have went though it and survived.   
After having a negative experience with strong side effects of Zoloft(snri), i have begun day one of treatment with Wellbutrin(nri).  Previous dosage of Zoloft was 50mg.  Beginning dosage for Wellbutrin is 150mg.  My goal with this medication is to be relieved of anxiety/social insecurity/touch of depression/lack of ability to focus or maintain attention to task.  Outside of the medication I have begun attending church in a more regular fashion.  It's a new church for me.  It's a small church and I like that.  I have spoken several times with the pastor and he has even offered to give me discipleship classes one on one!  I believe God is the ultimate healer.  For right now I will use this medication as well.  Anyone else on day one? 
Been suffering with depression and anxiety for about a year now, it's now becoming unbearable. I don't know what to do. The constant head aches the fact I don't see friends or family. I want to be alone but I also feel so alone I spend my days trying to distract my self but it's getting harder to block out the bad thoughts! I just lay in bed it's where I'm most comfortable. I feel so bad on my family they try and get me out the house and out of bed but I just don't want to. I feel like a physically can't and it gets me so upset. I'm constantly thinking Iv lost the plot and it makes me so tired. From the moment I wake up I feel as if I'm not even here, like I'm in a bubble I feel like nothing's real I don't feel connected to anything and it's so scary! It's like I have no control, I just don't want to be here anymore. Iv tried therapy, it helped whilst I was there and for a few hours after but then I would feel the same I did a training course called the lighting process but that hasn't seemed to shift anything yet. I was on herbal medication for months but nothing helped my last resort is anti depressants but I really didn't want to take them!  
how do you learn or fight depression,the thoughts of death ,the feeling funny,things not looking right(havent had that for a while) how does every1 learn to cope? 
There are various relaxation techniques your CPN can introduce so as to reduce the stress and depression we all suffer  There are three relaxation techniques, Maxwell, Alexander and Mindfulness.Your Practice or CPN can arrange some training in one of these and that can reduce stress.and relax your mood.  Remember when we know what is causing the Depression we are that much nearer to control our fears  BOB

I have been vomiting every morning for years and am ashamed to say that I never took it seriously since I smoke but ha e cut down to four cigs a day and lots when I can't sleep one doc actually told me I would get mentally sick if I stopped smoking that's how mad the quacks are here do u agree and which antacid is safe to take with haloperidol and Paxil  
My girlfriend has been suffering with depression for years, since way before we met.  I understand that she can't help what happens in her head, and that when she has her "bad days" that she isn't her true self during those times.  I just find it so hard during these times, and I don't know what I can say or do to make her feel better about it.  I also work away Sunday am to Friday pm, so I can't always be there to comfort her physically.  She's having one of her bad spells right now, and is talking about not being sure if she can handle the commitment, that she doesn't know if her head can handle it, and saying that her life is just a mess.  Yesterday everything was wonderful, we had friends round, we cooked paella together, and it was all smiles and happiness. Then all of a sudden when we got in to bed last night she seemed a bit cold, and this morning when I left for work there were very few of the usual loving comments before I left.  Now she's saying that she doesn't know if we're ok, that maybe she needs space, but she doesn't know.  The problem I have is that when I'm with her, I can see when she's in a bad place. When I'm not, it's a lot harder.  It always seems that she has these bad times when her ex (father of her child) starts acting like an idiot towards her, calling her horrible names etc. This happened on Friday. It's as if we make headway with her depression and then he kicks her back to square one.  I don't know whether to give her the space she's asking for, or to just carry on as normal. I don't want to push her away. But I also don't want to let her slip away. I love her so much, and I know she loves me.  Sometimes it's just so hard, like today. When she sent me the message saying about needing space it felt like I'd been hit square in the heart.  I'm just really confused about what I should do.  
does any1 else get bad stomach ,its either off the citrapram or proponol,it wakes me up somtimes 
i am 41 years old male and suffering from severe depression. i am also suffering from claustrphobia, which causes anxiety and panic attacks resulting in diarrhea. i feel bad about everything i did a day before and if there isn't anything from the day before then my mind would dig some thing from the past which will put me in depression. there is nothing in life that excites me and i lose interest in everything very quickly. if i want to get out of my comfort zone and do things, i'll have anxiety and some times panic attacks. i can not travel or go out with friends untill unless i take some anti anxiety pills. my life is restricted to my room only and i hardly go out. these are few things i shared here, hopefully i'll get some positive ideas. i am also taking zoloft 50mg per day. 
I'm on Paxil ten mg haloperidol five mg am and pm and laxotonil but can't sleep at night very active physically but mentally fresh 
I'm hoping someone can help me, or give me some pointers. Ive had the same problem for a number of years now but it is definitely getting worse. When a major event or an enjoyable experience come along, such as a vacation or my wedding, I spend so long looking forward to them and they consume my life. Then when they are over it can take me months of feeling low to get over. In some cases I have to take time of work and cant even bring myself to get out of bed. More recently though, I have started to anticipate the lows before the highs have even finished! I can be sitting a week into my three week honeymoon feeling depressed at how quickly it is going in! Is there a way to smooth the highs and lows? 
I am on a number of medications for severe depression.  A few months ago I decided to come off Lithium, I did it really slowly and had no adverse effects (this was undertaken with out the knowledge of cons/gp/cpn) Unfortunetly the week I finished tapering off my husband was diagnosed with cancer and is due to go into hospital to have the tumour removed in 2 weeks time. I dont know whether I should restart the lithium, just in case, or leave my head clear of all the muzziness. My GP and Lithium nurse know what i have done and my circumstances but neither are giving me any clues about what i should do. My GP has said that if I decide I needed or wanted to back to taking Lithium I was to go back and see him ASAP so he could work with my psychiatrist to get me back to my 'normal' level quickly. I am really confused about what I should do.   I was still getting bouts of deep depression every few months even while taking it, so if it wasnt working why have all the side effects. As you can tell my mind is completely jumbled up. What are your views or experience on what might be the best option for me 
Hi, I'm 43. I feel so depressed and very much alone. Lately I have been having very frightening anxiety attacks - my chest hurts and my throat feels as if it is closing up. I can't sleep and I feel so desperately sad all the time. I had a very traumatic childhood and I am having flashbacks, which are hard to deal with.  To make matters worse I have an extreme fear of doctors, I just can't go near them. It's such a big problem.. I'd very much like to know if there are any other people out there who have the same phobia of doctors.. Lately I feel that I don't want to go anymore. I feel so alone 
I am an 18 year old female. I have had a great and happy life. I have never been abused or anything like that. There is no reason for me to feel this way but I honestly don't have a will to live. Depression runs in my family. Everyday is filled with anxiety and sadness and worry. I don't find pleasure in the things I used to. I'm not suicidal but I just don't really want to be alive. I'm ready for death and I don't want to feel this way. 
i have been taking antidepressants for 9 month- no effect changed doctor- another antidepressand for 2 months - no effect changed anti depressant-- continuing for 1 month - still no effect  when i get up for few minutes i feel ok. later thoughts just rush into my brain, a non stop.-thoughts are not danger ones..but simple thoughts-- and it just irriates me- i feel a mental ache and try to divert myself--sometimes a sort of fear also comes in. and sometimes i myself dont know what is happening to me  pls help me out 
Hello everyone. I have had and still have a lot of medical issues ofr the past two years. I suffer physical pain du to arthritis and debilitating back pain. Had a totam knee replacement six months ago. All this, plus moving house and away from a region i've lived in for 38 years has caused me bad depression. I have tramadol for pain and now Prozac for depression. I read that th two must not mix but my doc said it's ok to take tramadol and prozac. I don't know what to do now. Any experiences or help here? Thankyou Pam 
I've been through therapy, medication doesn't work, almost about to lose my job, no friends no family and I don't see the point in going on. There's nothing left hidden in my psyche now. It's all exposed. But that's all a lie that opening up solves your problems.  There is not one thing left for me to do here.  
Anyone have nausea on Prozac should try crystallized ginger it really helps,it's like candy pieces  
Hey everyone, I'm new here. Let me start of by saying that this might be a little long, but I'm going to try to make it as short and simple as I can. I grew up in a difficult environment with a struggling single mother. I have a brother thats 2 years older than me. Growing up as a little girl I remember repeatedly being verbally, sexually, physically harrassed by peers I grew up with. I remember when I was very young in one occasion during one of my birthday parties a family member of mine felt up on my vagina and 24 years later I still remember the moment vividly and it continues to haunt me to this day, only I don't remember who it was. I have always had relatively unhealthy relationships with a lot of my family members and was always teased and bullied by them especially my older cousins the majority of the time. I have never felt a sense of closeness or support from them and always felt like I was doing something wrong. They used to punish me for any little thing I did, yell at me, scold me, tell me to go away, act like I was annoying them if I asked a question. I grew up feeling like I was always a nuissance, though I'm sure there were some good times mixed into those moments, the trauma was severe enough to help me devolop long term anxiety and a strong hate for my family. The frustrating part is, is that they all question why I hate spending time with them and none of them know what happened to me at my birthday party. My older brother has always bullied me and was always in competition with me especially after I got into one of the best schools in the country. He became more and more physically and verbally violent towards me, telling me that no one likes me and I have no friends and that my family hates me. I just don't understand why he says these things when I have never done anything to hurt him or anyone else. I don't get what I did that was so wrong that I deserve this sort of treatment. I also got out of a really bad breakup with a cheating ex and shortly after I got raped. I have no close friends because I'm busy with school and I find it difficult going out when I have anxiety and depression that is spiraling out of control. I tried going to a therapist but she acted like I was annoying her too! I just don't want to feel like this anymore I'm wasting my youth, I wwant to believe that there are good people out there but I'm starting to lose hope. 
I found this site by accident and alot of what has been written resonates with me.  I am married and have a 22 yr old son with disabilities.  I am also 50 yrs old. I have spent my entire life looking after people.  Up until i got married  (at 22) i was under the thumb of physical and emotionally abusive parents. Once my brother turned 18 he basically told them to fk off.   Who do you think got the blame?  I had my son at 28- 8 months later my brother took off and i was left to clean up the mess.  The following yr my dad had a heart attack  (he survived and thankfully i finally had a dad, not a father.  He truly became my rock and best friend).  My son was labelled with intellectual disabilities.   My father in law died from motor neurone disease.  My mother had a complete psychotic break.   My brother committed crimes (i was so lucky my dad never found out.   I had to lie to him ALL the time).   My dad died in 2009.  My mother and my brother turned their backs on me.   My credit is shot - to try an explain THAT would take hours.   My husband and i struggled for money for yrs.   And to top it off, he nearly died several months ago. All this has been happening from 1990 to this day.    Now, my son has a bad cold and i am in TEARS.  i feel so alone.  I can honestly say that if i wasn't scared of the pain, that i would end it.  There really is no future for me.   If i died tomorrow, i know that i have made no impact on this world.   I have had zero career.   I have zero money.  I sit at home watching tv on my own.   Zero motivation.   I wouldn't even bother showering if i didnt have to.  I do make an effort for my husband's sake because I don't want to worry him.    He is a good man but the one thing he lacks is empathy.   It's too late to change that. Many times I think of my dad.   How my life has changed COMPLETELY with out him.   Wondering whether or not i would see him again if i offed myself. I havent been diagnosed with anything because I have not told doctors anything.   The only way i will be happy is if i wake up one morning with no memory of anyone and started again. Sorry for my rants.   
That sinking feeling of unhappiness, fear & withdrawal that never goes away.  Is this a psychological feeling from living with depression & anxiety for so long OR is it due to strictly the depression & one's brain without the ability to find a medication to stop it.  No suffering from anxiety attacks, but a "constant" anxiety where you feel it in your chest & stomach.  Sure you can take some ativan if it becomes really bad but it still does not alleviate that sick hollow feeling.  Every movement or decision is an effort.  You can either sit and dwell on everything OR you can make that decision to move & achieve something (however so small).  Sharing your story is fine and some people may give you hope and understanding.  But, after awhile they will walk away and you are left with your terrible plight, Depression.  It is difficult to watch others go about their business of their jobs, families, etc.  They are lucky.  It is a black hole Depression coupled with anxiety.  The only key is the right medication to unlock the sadness! 
Prescribed 20mg tablets.  Taking this medication due to inability to focus/stay on track.  I believe this inability to focus and achieve is what is causing my depression.  Has anyone else recently started using this medication?  What are your thoughts/experience on beginning this medication please?  When did you notice an ability to have greater focus? 
I recently turned 50. I just don't want live anymore. I've done all the stupid things I could do and I don't want to do them anymore. I was not able to fulfill my destiny because of bad habits. I've had a sex addiction since I was teen-ager. When I was six years old, an older boy tried to rape me but I believe that rape attempt awakened in me sexual desires that I didn't know how to handle so 44 years later, Ive had all the sex I wanted. I've even started experimenting with homosexuality. I don't want to continue this. I just want to die. Everybody in my life will be taken care of. There's no need for me to be here. My son's mother told me yesterday in anger that I should just kill myself. What she dont know is that I have been contemplating that for weeks now. It's my life and I should be able to ended if I want!!! 
Hi all. I've just joined patient.info  and would like to know if any of you have experienced the same thins as I have.   I work as a PA, which I never really wanted to do because, as many do, I knew that I wasn't suited to it and I naturally shy away from speaking to people, one of the main points of the job.  Last yearI went through a really stressful period which ended with me breaking down at work, then suffering panic attacks. I end up being off of work for nearly 3 months with Depression and anxiety but returned to the job feeling like a new person after several appointments with a counsellor. I was also taking sertraline. Now, I've realised in previous jobs that I have a tendancy to start off well and start then go down hill. I get a talking to by my boss, realise what I'm doing wrong, set something in motion that should sort me out but can never stick to it.  The same with the Sertraline. I accidentally weened myself off of it becasue I got out of the habbit of taking it when I returned to work. Started taking again to suffer the horrible anxiety side effects then accidentally weened myself off again. Now I'm in trouble with my job. I'm hanging by a thread and I know exactly the things that I need to work on to correct it but feel like I cant do it. I feel nothing, almost like I dont care. I need to get through this for my wife and little boy but dont feel like I'm going to. I feel like I have no will power anymore and need to get this right for my family, the problem is, it seems in my nature to stop myself progressing and ruin my chances. Can anyone offer any advice?  
My mom passed away October 21, last year.  Her birthday was on the 4th. I thought I was handling this pretty well, but I've been very depressed all day today. I thought that going to therapy would help me get through this month, but I kept putting it off, because talking to someone on the phone gives me anxiety.  I'm not sure what to do or how bad this is going to get for me.

sorry in advance for my grammar or spelling  I honestly don't know where to start.  but here goes nothing right? last year , before going into highschool , my best friend and I decide to enroll into charter schools. and when we recieved new that we were picked to go to the charter school we both were so happy moreover I was just so happy we could stay together , looking back at it I would have liked for someone to tell me how hard charter schools are ,In a way I knew what i was getting myself into, but you know what i wanted a 'better education' I wanted to prove to myself and family that I could do better if I just tried harder. keep in mind we had to start school earlier then others (i reallly don't know how people can do that but props to you fam) my mom and I went to the unifrom stores that week to buy clothes and things I needed because they were very specific.  everymorning I would have to wake up around 4 or 5am to get ready and catch the bus to go to the  school since it was in a different district.  now im not saying i had a hard time with all of that because i know there are people who do much much more than what i did.  anyways the first two weeks were okay but they seriously gave alot of work. for sure i realized i wasn't ready for it.  by october it started , i started to hear people whisper 'it stinks'  'wet dog' and it didnt worry me at first because this never ever happend to me and i knew my hygein wasn't bad.  but it started to get to me when i began to hear my name in the sentences.  i though it would stop but it just continued. and even though my bestfreind was there i really couldn't bring myself to tell anyone.  that is until we reached the end of october.  i really couldn't take it , i hated waking up so early , i haetd going to sleep so late to busy worrying about what would happen the next day, and i hated that i didn't know what was going on.  why me? i started to question myelf. at first i thought it was maybe because i needed to take more than one shower a day. so i woke up extra early to clean myself up. soon enough i didn't have to take the puiblic bus because the school then provided one for the kids that didn't live in the town. I thought the bus was going to be a safe place because the kids in there seemed nice and decent but soon they also started to realise it to.  that day, when we came of the bus his friend asked him 'does she stink?' and he just nooded and said 'yeah'. i wanted to collapse right there and then but i kept telling myself that this is what i woud have to go through if i wanted a better education since the highschool i was supposed to go to had and still has a bad reputation.  i didn't bother eating breakfast so then we went to class , i remember that day to clear . it was algebra class and the teacher had changed my seat to the front of the class and the guy that sat next to me well he started to also say it smelled and covered his nose aswell. you know those types of guys that think they are the sh*t and think they are so cute well he was one of those guys. after a having hearing the comments so much i decide i really couldn't do it anymore so i basically had a breakdown , it happend when we were changing classes i remember having to go to spanish but i quickly got a pass from the teacher since i guess she could see the panic and tears building up in my eyes.  i went to the bathroom and i tried looking for solutions towards why this was happednig to me and i found nothing.  oh i also remember we weren't allowed to use cellphones at all under no currcumstances. but i used mine. my hands started to tremble and shake , my eyes were to teary i could bearly see my mom's contact number.  when my mom answered she was had just gotten out of the hospital from a check up because i was going to have another baby sister.  i asked her to come pick me up and when she heard my voice shake and nose sinffle she knew she had to come right away.  keep in mind the school staff didn't know i had called my mom so they just sent me up to class again.  when my mom came to pick me up i no longer wanted to talk to anyone. that was until i got home and finally build up the courage to tell her , i was afraid she wouldn't believe me but when she saw how much i was crying she called my pidiatrician to get a check up and see what was going on .  the next morning when we went to see the pidiatrician she said she didn't smell anything and that what the kids were doing was bullying .. *up until now i dont think it's bullying well i'm not sure anymore to what is what* she said 'go to school nothing is wrong' , she said 'be brave it's normal' but i couldn't i felt like everything was falling apart.  i no longer wanted to live. so when i got home i , i took down a bottle of pills. but my sister noticed something was off so she called my mom to come check up on me. after realising what i did she called the ambulance and taken to the hospital , i was put  in there for about 2 week in 'therapiodic' or something but it was for people my age. and trust me it was pretty bad in there , not because the staff were horrible but because i missed my family. i was told i was supposed to be in there for a month but i thankfully got out in the next wensday. i was transferred back to the highschool i was origanlly supposed to got to (the one in my town) and i was kinda glad to be somewhere knew but i sensed it wouldn't be over and i was right . so in mid november i decide not to go anymore and i refused to go anywhere. so far i was given 3 social workers *case managers* for crisis or whatever it's called . they gave me a teacher to come teach me home. but she also started to cover her nose with her hand or sweater or putting on perfume and lotion whenever she got the opportunity. they stopped giving me the teacher in the last few weeks of school and again i went throught the same cycle. so i choose to skip class. and it affected me badly , but what can i say i was scared and my anexity had increased due to what happend. my therapist included that she didnt smell anything , that it was all in my head but no . i know it's not.  my mom and sister think it's all in my head aswell.  this year im in my sophmore year in credit recovery due to horrible choices i made.  it was going all okay , i heard a couple comments  here and there but i ignored them but today , nope i really couldn't lie to myself and say it was all in my head because i know it's not and i feel like sooner or later i may break again.  i just wish i found an explination for all of this .   i need to find a solution without it being 'all in my head' im scared that the same things will happen , i just want a simple life you know? i just want to get through all of this and go to college ,marry someone,have kids, all that squshy dumb stuff , maybe it's to much to ask for everything to go back to normal .   please help me    
Hello I've been feeling really low recently, it comes and goes. Today I've already had lots of ups and downs!  It depends on how busy I am I guess. I've been on citralopram for 7 months (40mg for about 5 months) which has helped me so much and after a long wait had my first talking therapies session on Friday, my anxiety was very high before and during the session and I'm now constantly thinking about things.  Due to holidays of the therapist and then half term my next session is in three weeks which feels like forever away.  I'm guessing the talking therapy has triggered stuff that I think I've managed to block with the antidepressants and that I know I'm going to have to talk about. I just felt the need to write this down as I don't have anyone to talk to.  At the moment it is just my husband (who I can't talk to about it as he doesn't understand why I'm depressed!), my Doctor and now the talking therapist and whoever reads this who knows about my depression!  A bit of a blabbering message but feel the need to express myself to people who will understand. Thanks if you've read this.

I have been onLithium for nearly 10 years for severe depression.  I have recently stopped taking it, reducing gradually over 3 months.  The process was fine, no "withdrawl" symptons. However 3 weeks down the line and I have symptoms that I have been told by a friend are due to the lack of lithium in my brain, which it has to get used to. These effects include a constant headache, light headedness, and achy joints. has anyone heard of this or experienced it?  If so how long did it last for.   
I've been depressed severely for almost 1 year. The days keep going on and am trying to better myself regarding my depression but facing repetitive failures. I believe in my friends more than me and i hoped that they could help me out in handling this which again is a misinterpretation. They doubt me for my activities eventhough i've said enoough about my feels. Right now am feeling as the world's most worthless person incapable of keeping my relationships to me. My attempts are going in vain and am unable to consult any doctors right now. I just feel like i want to stay away from everyone alone and aloof. Nobody is ready to give me the time to recover and am undergoing constant insults and blamings for behaving in an inappropriate way. So, on the whole i have made a circle for myself and i should be the only one within it speaking very less and doing things which won't irritate or affect others. Please do share your opinions and is there any solution to come out of this bubble. P.S- Self harm has been a constant stress reliever and almost addicted to it. 
Hi guys  I've been on citalopram for year now, with a few failed attempts to reduce.   I was up at 40mg for a good while and with the help from my doctor I managed to slowly reduce to 20mgs. Last month i forgot to take my tablet for 2-3 days and quickly felt as bad as I did before I ever started on the citalopram. I went back to my doctor who put me back to 40mgs of citalopram and propranolol.   I felt kind of better after a few weeks but in the last few days I've felt terrible again. I don't know what's happening to me, usually I'm back to normal by now, I have been on the 40mgs for 4 weeks now. I'm worried I'm going to be like this forever.   Can anybody give me any advice or has this happened to anyone else? I was pinning so much hope on these tablets working again and I don't know what to do. Maybe I'm not giving them enough time to work. Any advice would be much appreciated.   Thanks Danielle 
So I'm 25 and I've had depression for as long as I can remember. Recently I left my long term job to try something new and I hate it. Before I realised I hated it I noticed I was struggling massively with anxiety along with self harming and avoiding social situations. I'm now stuck in this job feeling hopeless. I feel sick every morning at the thought of having to go in, I think about what would happen if I just threw myself in front of a bus. I appreciate this isn't all job related as o have these thoughts anyway but this job seems to amplify these thoughts. I can't afford to leave but whilst I'm there I can't seem to find the energy to apply for a job. My partner is worried about me and money though if I leave. The company is so small that if I have time off there is no one to cover or anyway of avoiding the awkwardness when I return. Has anyone else felt like this? It's Sunday morning and I woke up feeling terrified that I have work in less than 24 hours so now I'm going to ruin a Sunday with my family worrying.   
sorry if its long and if there r typos... btw we dont live in the same city my friend went through depression for 2-3 years after moving then came back to her old country. At the time i didn't really know that so i coundn't help her. now i know. she is back and moved to a new school and made new friends but seems to still be depressed. when the smalest thing happens such as a very little fight with a friend she sais 'i am depressed again and i feel like am as depressed as i was in my old school'. like seriously, the past i in the past like she came to a new school and made new friends and over came her depression and then when the slightest thing happens its back to depression land. i dont know if she does this for attention or any other reason. i went through depression and over came it alone(not saying that i expect others to overcome it alone but mine was minor). yes i used to self harm and yes i didnt tell my parents. i told her but not the self harm because she used to copy evrything i do. i didn't want her to copy that. i explained to her hat i respect her opinion and that i love her no matter what btw. i told her the truth that like its too much, she keeps on making suicide jokes its wayy too much.(ex: i am gonna jump off the bacony now i love u, then i called her and she said that she was bored) nut she is not considering suicide, i know it, there is  no reason to do that, she is not having anything severe going on in her life like litterly NOTHING. i told her that she is the only one who will over come this. Its psycological, she is shuving the idea into her mind that she is weird and other stuff, the thing is that she is suving it in in and doesnt even wanna take it out. i told her that for a day she has to stay positive no joking around and like to not think about her bad friends. if u were in my place, you would understand, its obvious she is kind of lwaantng attention.. i dont know how to describe it. we do these little skype calls where i try to takl and open her eyes and help her but she keeps on taling about what she wnet through and that its normal that its not going.  is what i am doing correct i am kind of lost and i need your help.

Hi i suffer from depression and cannot tolerate prozac, citalopram, zoloft because they inflame my stomach. Im taking pariet to control reflux and when i tried prozac for a week my stomach became severly inflamed leading to a high dose of pariet for 3 weeks to get it under control again. Is there an antidepressant that doesnt cause stomach inflammation that i could try? thanks 
im at my breaking point! im 30 and i have nothing! i really mean nothing! i live with my mum and stepdad i dont work, i dont leave the house hardly at all, the only thing i do is watch tv show after tv show so i can escape into a better life but the minute i stop watching something i start feeling down, i go days not talking out loud, my mum barely talks to me shes too wrapped up in her own world, i have a sister who doesnt have the time or patience for me and i dont have any friends. im incapable of having any kind of relationship with anyone so really when you think about it i really do need to just give up! im so unhappy, im so alone its unreal and i dont want to go on anymore like this and i know i wont get any better as i have tried everything the doctor has thrown at me i completed CBT which is the only free service available so i have been discharged for the like 100th time.. i cant go on anymore and yet im pathetic and dont have the guts to do anything.  i think of what i could do to kill myself and it sounds awful and painful i just hope i get to the point where i am so desperate i just do it without thinking!  i have been looking around on the internet for hours cos i just cant explain how lonley i feel right now and the internet offers nothing! it makes me feel worse because mental health is just subjected around Young people now and im not young anymore i have suffered my whole life it just gets worse! i try not to self harm cos that makes me feel worse ! its such a kid thing to do apparently! no one will probably even finish reading this cos why would they! im not looking for an answer as  there really is just one and that would be to end all !  if i go and stand at the edge of somewhere will anyone come and push me off the edge? think thats what i need.. i need someone to push me so i dont have to jump!  im so desperate i dont know what to do!!!!  Sorryy 
Hi  I had bi polar for twenty three years and due to psychosis four times and hospitalized the doctor upgraded my illness  to schzioaffective disorder and put me on antipsychotic aripiprazole  On the upside I am back at work and have  no voices or hallucinations, which is great. I find this drug is better than risperidone, but am still struggling on it. Feel blunted and no motivation  i miss enjoying life and socialising. I make myself do things but the drug holds me back.

Last year I was taking Abilify and it made my depression a bit better and easier, and it made me enjoy my hobbies and art a LOT, which is great. But I had to stop taking it, because it was interfering with my thinking (it caused brain fog, and less creativity ) it made me really tired, and it also caused hand tremors....... I REALLY need a medication that WON'T cause hand tremors or brain fog or fatigue...and maybe a medication that can also work for pain too! I think SNRI'S are less likely to cause hand tremors...Abilify also helped me have a better appetite, because depression causes no appetite for me.... PLEASE REPLY IF YOU KNOW ANY GOOD ANTIDEPRESSANTS  Thanks  
So, my anxiety has come back with a vengeance. Managed to cope without it for a couple of months. I've suffered for around 5 years now, with spots of depression thrown in at serious times of stress.  I am currently sick of constantly feeling unwell and falling into severe panic attacks. So much so, that I have that feeling of impending doom constantly and even though I live a comfortable and happy life, I feel unhappy. Seriously unhappy and fed up. I don't see the point in anything anymore and it's horrible. I sometimes want to cry and can't, because it's too exhausting. Other times I burst unexpectedly.  Anyone experiencing anything similar? 
If anybody is interested in alternatives to the current system (psychiatric drugs) please let me know. There is a reason that they are categorized as pyschiatric drugs and not medicines. Medicines cure, drugs cause dependence. God Bless. 
I am 18 and have been diagnosed with depression since I was 14 as a result of abuse and was on Fluoxetine (prozac) for 3 years which came to an end when a family member decided they would hide my repeat prescription because they didn't want me on the medication any longer and I had finished my CBT around this time and could not tell my therapist to get another prescription. I have managed without for a year, only having a few episodes but just generally dealing with it. However I was diagnosed with genital herpes (which I got from my partner) last week and I cannot help the bad thoughts and feelings. I feel incredibly low and am having trouble coming to terms with it. I feel like I am now unloveable. I am arguing with my boyfriend a lot because of it even though he gave it to me and he was my first everything (together at 14) he is still throwing accusations about, making me feel worthless. I am scared to tell my doctor in fear of my family member finding out and hiding my prescription again. Not sure what I should do as I am worried that if I do not go back on medication I will get even worse and I do not want to be back in that place.  
Does depression make your eyes sensitive to light and sun. I find that I can't stand light especially white bright lights. Does it also make your eyes look tired kinda like a constant lazy eye? and when I go out in the sun it's very uncomfortable for my eyes and I would come home and sleep for hours.  Does it also affect your speech like as if talking requires so much effort and energy. That happens to me like I would stutter and crack as I tried to speak.  Please offer insights!! Thanks  
Why is life so horrible? Why can't we all be normal? I wish and pray to God to give me the strength to end this life and hopefully live a better in the next ! I can't cope anymore � 
I'm going to say maybe about 2 years ago I did something terrible and just disgusting and illegal. I don't know why I did it but I can't take it back. Lately I've learnt to live with it but every now and then it slips back in my mind. Last night it came back to me completely and I was in a state where I just told myself I'm a bad person. I'm a terrible person and I deserve to die. I laid in bed telling myself that last night and I believed it. Do I deserve to die because of what I did? I can't tell anyone because I know everyone would hate me and I don't blame them, I hate myself for what I did. It's consuming me and I don't know how to live with what I did. I'm a believer in god and I'm terrified that God hates me because of what I did. I feel like i want to self harm. Every time I see someone I think "i bet they haven't done something as bad as me" I'm not a rude person, I treat everyone with respect and I have a great family and friend life but I don't know why I did what I did. 
Hi all,   I am feeling very low and miserable am anxious about every little thing was wondering if anyone was free to Chat and discuss things that have helped you threw your experiences.  Thanks in advance kev, 
I have been taking zoloft for over a decade and am questioning whether it's still effective. Anyone out there having issues? 
Hello,  For the past 7,8 years or so I've been experiencing what seems like a constant chronic variety of symptoms. I wake up in the morning feeling un refreshed even after sleeping a good 8 hours. In addition to that I experience this debilitating brain fog, thick clogged up congested head that is so bad it renders me immobile in the morning as I can't do anything or think clearly or even get my thoughts out clearly.  This makes me very depressed as I can't seem to get a diagnosis I've had my thyroid,cortisol levels checked MRI all blood work checked all came back "normal".  it might be worthwhile to mention that it's extremely hard to focus my focus is gone my eyes can't stay open as they're always trying to close on me and going out in the sun makes my situation 10x worse as the sun extremely drains the energy out of me.  It's very frustrating and what baffles me the most out of all my symptoms is that I'm so mentally fatigued that it's hard to get my speak out in the sense that I literally have no energy to speak as everytime I open my mouth or try to speak it seems like I'm loosing fuel/mental energy to speak so I barely speak at all. And when I do it comes out extremely mumbled due to the lack of energy to properly articulate my words clearly.To me it's very concerning and I also always feel this constant pressure on my head like as if someone is pushing down on it. I'm exhausted every day and I really need to figure this out in order to move on with my life.  I haven't worked in years because of this and it's like I'm falling into that downward spiral and really need help.  Thanks for reading and I look forward to your comments.    
Hi,  I'm 23 and over the past 10 months I've not been 'feeling myself' I put that down to leaving one job and waiting for the next one to appear, while I was unemployed I was eating as I was bored so put on a little bit of weight and that's when things started to go downhill in my self confidence.  Over the past few months ive recently got back into work and I love my new job but things with my partner are getting worse.  He tried killing himself a few months ago so I've been trying to do everything I can to make his life as easy as possible and I've put myself on the back burner, eating crap and generally just not looking after myself.   Money has been tight and I'm in a little bit of debt which I don't think is helping things however recently I'd say the last 3 months I've just had no motivation to do anything, I hate going out and being social, I don't even want to get up in a morning.  Each day is a constant battle with my own head to allow me to do simple things like drive to work without panicking.   Today I went to the doctor to talk to someone about it but I darent mention it to my partner as he doesn't understand.   He just tells me that I'm lazy and that he shouldn't have to be doing everything around the house and that it should be my job to look after him.   I just feel worthless, unappreciated and I just don't see the point. I often wonder what would happen if I crashed my car, would anyone be bothered.   I don't really know why I've written on here, i suppose just to see if I'm alone in what I'm feeling or if I just need to buck my ideas up and get on with it as I'm being told by my boyfriend.  
I am 19 years old. I am fat, ugly, and have not done anything great in life up till now. I don't think I ever will. I don't articulate very well so please bear with me.  My dad has a transferable job and I have lived in 4 cities in the last 4 years and this year will be moving to a new one(but that's for college). I have had and lost so many friends and experiences. It's saddening and deeply frustrating to feel quite so lonely all the time. I also find myself not trying very hard to maintain those lost friendships. It is very hard to establish roots in a new place so many times and I've only ever felt more tired and saddened every new place I go. Since I am slightly introverted, it takes me time to open up to a new group of people.  I know I seem like a happy person because I joke and laugh with people once I open up enough, but where once it was a natural feeling, I now feel forced and pushed to do it. I spend most of my time alone, quietly and my mind going over a million things a minute over something from the past or some such event.   I don't know why or when this started but in my early teen years I was always quite outspoken and freely met people and was not bothered by having to move to a new city. Then about 7 years ago I started to feel less of myself, started being unsure of myself, felt underconfident about things I usually wouldn't, but I always managed to push those feelings aside. I gradually lost my feelings of inferiority and I was a pretty happy person till 3 years ago. I figured every teenager feels those things at some point so it couldn't have been something especially terrible that I was feeling - something apart from others in my peer group who must've hid some of their problems too. I had grown to love that place and the people there after staying there for four long years - after having moved almost yearly before going there. I'd enjoyed living there; I had done pretty great in my studies and I had lovely friends. So I did not relish the idea of leaving; yet it didn't bother me too greatly at the time. Initially all was well - I had a new friends circle in a new city, my studies were alright. It wasn't a very good place if I were to pick it apart. But I also was very much in touch with my old friends. Soon enough, I wanted to go back - I would talk to my old friends all the time, choose facebook and whatsapp over studies, sometimes not pay attention in class. Sure enough, I did badly in tests and exams. I felt terrible about it - I have always been a dedicated student, always enjoyed maths and science and yet I had done very badly. I felt very ashamed and tried to put away my distractions. I ended the year well with good grades and was starting to grow to like this new place too. I didn't have to cut off ties my old friends either completely to manage distractions but had found a balance and was still developing good bonds with the people here. And then my dad got transferred again.  I absolutely flipped; I screamed and shouted and revolted at the idea of going to yet another place - that too in the last year of school - when I had finally started to like where I was. I did leave; I was miserable for the first two months. I was quiet and shy and didn't feel like doing anything. My studies suffered, my focus never got together and even though I managed to mix in somewhat towards the end and had found a kindred spirit, I did not do well in the finals and entrance exams for colleges. Throughout the year, I felt underconfident, I had grown fat and felt ugly, I always felt tired and subdued, and I HATED feeling that knowing I had no business lamenting over things as petty as moving places when I had been blessed with a good upbringing. Yet I was so saddened all the time - and could never find the spirit and fire to compete and achieve something that I KNEW I have always had in me previously. That's when I started making stupid decisions. So last year I decided I would give another shot at entrance exams and stay home for a year(a drop year) in the yet another new city; I would study hard on my own, I stopped talking to everyone of my friends, absolutely spent the entire year literally alone with no one to talk to but my mother - and there's only so much I can tell my mother without feeling horrible about being a burden to my parents and being useless all around. I rallied for some time, but then I started feeling extremely suffocated, I could not concentrate, I could not stick my head in my books. I constantly thought about everything that I could've done right and it was frustrating and depressing to think that when I had never been one to fret. And what was more pathetic was this awareness that I wasn't like this earlier when I was young and when it mattered little what I did than now when I had potentially started building my life. I don't know.. I also felt like I never had fun anymore; that I didn't how it felt to have fun anymore. I didn't feel happy doing things that I previously enjoyed. I tried swimming to relax my head and body but I just couldn't rid the spiralling mire of guilt and unhappiness. I felt so undermined - I constantly, constantly felt that I didn't have it in me to achieve and do well, something that I never felt before, something I never THOUGHT about feeling before, you know? I don't know.. the only thing that made me forget this was if I read novels or watched movies or somehow kept my head occupied. Everytime I would sit down to study I would start  feeling terrible about lost opportunities and think about my friends achievements over and over and over again. I tried meditating but couldn't get any satisfactory result. It was pathetic; I know if somebody had told me they had this problem to committing to hardwork, I would think it was pathetic and an attempt to escape blame. But I knew all too well feeling low and embarrassed and sad ALL THE TIME. Hence, I read and read and read novels or stupid even fanficton or just do anything to keep my mind occupied. No wonder my studies suffered.   I have not done too great this year. I have not gotten any of the places I wanted. And I feel even worse about myself. I feel I would be much better off away from my parents, after repeatedly being such a disappointment to them, being such an useless person, being so wholly underaccomplished. I don't think I will ever have anyone I could relate these things to without sounding like a whiny, self-absorbed brat. I know I probably do now too, with my little problems when people everyday fight against so much. But I feel so.. drained, and worn out, and I don't know what to do anymore to conquer this constant feeling of loneliness and emptiness because I don't want to feel it and I hate the feeling. It's not like I haven't tried reaching out to people. I tried to talk to my mother that maybe my having moved so many places hampered my studies and routines, but I can't do that without sounding like someone whining about how they couldn't get any of my favorite colleges and blaming it on their parents. I tried telling that maybe I needed a friend to talk to but they don't understand why I would need a friend to study with. And I feel worse because *I* had refused to take coaching classes and thereby losing any chance to gain mates I could talk to in the new city. I try to reconnect with my many many circles of old friends, and I have, but frankly it's depressing to watch them moving on with their lives and enjoying college but still keeping in touch by having reunions. Is that spiteful jealousy on my part? Watching them doing great things and knowing that I won't ever do that because I am not where they are and how talented they have shown themselves to be? I feel like there's so much effort I have to put in to sound normal. I feel so undeserving and desparate. I don't know how to stop feeling this. Just going incognito again? I don't think so. It cost me everything this time. I understand things more clearly now, I think. I get that I would feel alright once I go to college and have peers around me. I understand that I would do well in the things I want to only when I am happy and content and don't have a head obsessing over little things from the past. I understand, but I don't feel good about myself.  I am in yet another new city now(since the past month), but I'm going to join a decent college elsewhere pretty soon. I don't want to start it with a depressed head on my shoulders. Please tell me if I am just being stupid and a brat or it is normal to feel this way for a person like me. Please tell me if what I feel has anything to do with depression. 
Hi, I'm after some help on something I'm going through. I had a depression incident some 15 years ago. I've been on 20mg of Paroxetine since, but been fine. However, i tried to come off them 2 months ago, and had withdrawl effects. Then about 3 weeks ago I had a " emotional crash", and suffered terrible anxeity / depression since. I've been put back on Paroxetine at 40mg (for 3 weeks now), I am having lots of negative thoughts, tremors, insomnia and more. Coincidently, these are possible side effects of paroxetine too. Does anyone have experience of this?  
At for some apparent reason I can't stop crying,  I'm angry agitated at what haven't a clue. Been in the loos crying, scratched my stomach to try and get rid of this tension now it's bled through my top so now got to cover it up. Taken 5mg diazepam the two people I trust at work ate both off, feel stupid phoning cmht duty person cos I am struggling feel so useless today and so angry hope these pills kick in soon. Could take another but won't be able to function then. F.... All this I feel so pathetic.  Sorry rant over for now.  
Hi,  As of writing this I have been to 3 sessions of cbt for depression and anxiety. I'm under no assumptions that 3 sessions is anywhere near enough time to be all that beneficial, but you know when you just have a feeling that it's not for you?  So far, I've definitely found it helpful even just having someone to listen to some of the things playing on my mind, but I get the feeling that it's more due to the fact I've never spoke about my feelings to another person before, and once the sessions end, I'll never speak about them again either. So it's a relief to have that kind of outlet.  The thing is, our sessions have gone a bit like this so far -  I'll tell her something that's happened to me that week, I'll tell her how it made me feel, and I'll also tell her how irrational my feelings are and how I am fully aware that a lot of my anxiety and paranoia is in my head but for some reason I feel powerless to it anyway. Then she will comment on how good it is that I'm self aware about my problematic thought patterns. And that's it.  In my first session, after she said about how positive it was that I am able to rationalise my thoughts I asked her if she had any more comments or suggestions but she turned it back on me and asked what I thought I should do and uh, I had no idea?   Again, I know 3 sessions isn't going to magically fix things, and I know that the idea behind cbt isn't to tell you what to do and is more about helping you draw conclusions on your own (right?) But what happens if you've already drawn those conclusions and you still wind up sabotaging yourself? Right now I feel like I could have a million of these sessions and I'll only end up going through the same process.  This week at my session we are going to discuss whether cbt is right for me and discuss other methods that might work as well/instead. What would be really useful to me is if anybody here could tell me their own experiences of what they've found works if cbt doesn't? Or even if someone could tell me what other options there are because I don't want to go into this session blind. I'm scared that I'll just agree to something I'm not going to actually feel will be beneficial simply because I have a knack for just agreeing to things just to be polite or because I want to tell people what I think they want to hear.  Sorry if this is a little long winded.  Take care everyone x 
Hi everyone me again so I'm on week 5 of sertraline 100mg still can't believe that my depression and anxiety have improved,hard to believe that 5 weeks ago thought I was and wanted to die,on Friday after some good advice from on here I was put on aripiprazole 5mg for intrusive thoughts......not sure what's going on don't feel they are as intense and have found I have some peace in my head at last this evening though I feel a little anxious and now worrying the thoughts are going to come back ....are they or is it just me ?,hope you all are finding help and reassurance on here and starting to feel better x 
I've been diagnosed with depression for  over 10 year's but recently been  getting  worse , with thoughts  of suicide,  been referred to see a phycatrist and still waiting,  the odd feeling is I'm happy at times and show no effects of feeling really low but then get the feeling of worthlessness and don't want to carry on anymore,  like I'm only here for my 2 children who live with me full time and wouldn't want to leave on their own . I know it's selfish and wouldn't do anything for that reason but if I didn't have any children I feel at times there would be nothing to live for , people  don't understand how living with depression is very hard and get to old to ' get on with life ' which in their minds is ok but wish they could have a mind of a person suffering with this horrible illness , I'm not sure if I have clinical depression?  Is there any difference between  this and just normal depression.? I feel good one day then the next feel like ending it !!  
Hi, I'm an 18 year old female and last year I was diagnosed with depression and also anxiety & panic disorder.  I have tried many things such as CBT etc however nothing seemed to help and so my doctor had put me on propranolol. After a few weeks of taking this my anxiety did seem to decrease but unfortunately my depression just seemed to worsen, my doctor has now decided to prescribe me with Fluoxetine (same as prozac). I have read the leaflet the medication comes with and it seemed to scare me abit (I do understand that with every medication comes possible side effects but with suicidal thoughts being one is extremely frighting as I already suffer from this and dont want it to get worse). I also havent been told anything positive about taking this drug of people who are close to me. I was wondering if anyone who has taken this could share with me their experiences on it? Much appreciated!  
All day everyday, I'm crying, having panic attacks and taking it out on the one person I love in this world I know she is coming to her wits end and wants to leave me but if that happens I would have literally no reason to live so I need to change but I don't know how and she keeps recommending I get real professional help but I'm not comfortable with that please help 
I was told my dad was a horrible Man but I need to Kmow Where I came from maybe that's why I'm me? I need to know ! I Hate him already yet I don't even know Him?  
So I take celexa forty mg a day but about 4 weeks ago I got put on buspar currently I don't feel anxious just nervous and scared I cry all the time I feel very depressed I don't want to do anything its a struggle to go to work everyday noone understands. The racing thoughts are hideous. My trigger was a girl that I don't associate with because we had words normally I don't think about it. What's wrong with me? Did my celexa stop working? Is it the buspar?  
I just wish I could sleep all of this away and wake up when this nightmare is over. Or I wish I could see through a crystal ball that this will end and my life will go back to being "normal".  I just turned 32 on Friday, my husband just moved us into a new place that's directly off the water. I have a beautiful view and I can't snap out of this depression. I'm consumed with worry about my health, I just went to the doctor's on my 32nd birthday awaiting results and I'm impeding doom. My poor husband is extremely supportive but he gets frustrated which is understandable. I can't sleep long and I'm not eating much. Not certain if that's the depression or something with my health. I saw a psychiatrist and just started taking Prozac for am anti-depressant and Trazadone to sleep.   I'm constantly praying... please someone help me.

Feeling hopeless  My mum has been extremely depressed and anxious for 18 months and tried to commit suicide 2 months ago. Seeing her in intensive care really affected me and I feel like I have become very depressed too. My mum walks around the house all day repeating the same things and saying she needs to leave us for our sake and she's gonna run away and things like that. I am finding extremely hard to cope.  On top of this I have been going out with my boyfriend for 4 months, he is the loveliest most caring guy and he really loves me. However I don't love him the same, I fear that I've been using him accidentally to get away from my situation at home. I spend most of my nights at his house and sleep there almost every night. I have spoke to him about all of this but I still feel guilty about it. He says don't worry about hurting him but that's all I worry about 24/7 and can't imagine breaking up with him. When I go out with him I find myself getting annoyed sometimes but I have always put a lot of pressure on myself to enjoy things and so usually don't enjoy them. I am a very anxious person myself and how really struggled with life since being 16. I'm 23 now and this is my first relationship and he was my first everything, this makes it so much harder to think about letting go. I can't enjoy myself doing anything anymore because it just goes round and round in my head that this is wrong. But I can't imagine another girl with him which makes me feel selfish coz I can't give him the love he gives me. I feel that I will be like this in any relationship because of my anxieties and all I want to do at the moment is stay in bed. To top everything off my job is extremely stressful at the moment and I am beginning to hate it.  I am constantly fighting with myself and just want this pain to go away. It's starting to debilitate my life. I want to see him but I'm not sure I'm doing the right thing for me or him, but when things are bad at home I want to go to him. I used to look at him and feel happy and now I don't feel anything which scares me. I don't know whether this is the depression making me lose feelings or it just isn't there. I can't bare thinking about this. I have a sinking feeling if I think about breaking up with him. I just want it to work out and to feel happy.  To top everything off my job is extremely stressful at the moment and I am beginning to hate it. Everything is just a mess. And I can't go on feeling like this. Nothing makes me happy anymore.  
Is it common for seniors to get depression ?     I have suffered for a long time on and off with it, but very mildly.    However it seems worse now I am in my seventies.   Don't want to take anti-depressants, because I have had bad reactions in the past and have ended up in A & E.  I would like to hear from anybody if you suffer from depression and what do you take, or do to try to combat it. 
hello  My auntie has recently gone throught a break up, she is 60 and has split with her husband of 15 years. She has 2 grown up children (her and their dad split up 28 years ago) and 4 grandchildren.  Since the split earlier this year I have noticce her decline, she looks like she has ages about 10 years in 10 months, she has always been a young 60 and likes a drink and a party but is now going out a lot more often, she is out till 4am at parties and drinking loads, she works full time also and is constantly hungover at work or sometime still over the limit in the morning when driving to work. Everyone has tried to talk to her but she won't take any notice.  Just this past month she has lost a drastic amount of weight and I am not sure why, she is eating normally and drinking loads so I would think she would be putting it on. She has had 2 pretty bad falls recenlly as well, one in the house and one on the street and she says she hasn't tripped over anything, both falls she banged her head, so it was more of a collapse! Both were sober falls! She won't go see a doctor even though we are all asking her to!   Do you think she is depressed? Or poorly? I know she drinks way over the 14 units a week, I would say she drinks more than 14 units a night when she is out, she goes out most weekends - is that making her ill with stress too? she was very over weight and not active at all - now she is thinner but not healthy thin! We are all very worried about her but not sure what to do! 
The situation that happened to me a while ago, I wouldn't wish to anyone....No one should feel such pain and emptiness in their life. After that situation I regret about every single thing that I have done... I wish I could've changed anything, I am so hopeless, and hurt. I deeply regret of all that I have done past a year ago.... I would like to give an advice please do not trust to anyone,even friends. I got hurt, and I never wish to anyone to feel the same way as I do. It is just a nightmare, please listen to your heart, and don't make mistakes. 
Does anyone have their face to flush while taking Prozac? 
I just turned 30 a few weeks ago. I lost my job for the second time in 3 years, for basically taking the wrong decision, yet again in my life.  I dropped out of university when i was 21 and i feel its all come back to haunt me now. My family thinks im a complete failiure, i dont blame them. I lost all my friends, every single one. Ive become highly dependent on marijuana, just the thought of running out crushes me.  I cant seem to cope with family or life without it. In the past few months ive literally gone from bad to worse. Im going bald, i feel my health is detoriating by the day and ive literally lost all will. I dont have any money left, i broke up with my girlfriend because i convinced her shes better off without me, she doesnt need someone like me in her life, and i say the same to my parents. I feel worthless and hopeless and completely stuck.  I want to go back to finish my educatioj, get out of the house and excercise, feel useful in some way or feel loved or wanted, but i cant.  If i died right now, it would literally take days before anyone knew! The idea of suicide has crossed my mind but im too scared. Locking myself at home and smoking all day is the most comforting thing i can think of.  I dont know what to do or where to start if i dont have a dollar to my name.  I have no one and nothing, and i feel im a burden to everyone i come across. Please help me!  I was a happy person at one time and very much well liked. Talking to someone isnt an option, because well, i just cant. I cant open up, i cant talk about myself in that way, id just rather keep it in and not burden anyone.  
I'm not sure if this is the right forum so I'm going to be posting on a few others too.  My depression is at its heights at the moment. Started a few days ago, constant crying and feeling very very low and angry too.  Anyway, my partner was texting a woman who he claims to have known from when he used to do horse riding. He says he's speaking to her to arrange for his younger sister to go riding.. but the problem is.. as an example I'm going to use my birthday. Which was Thursday. So we woke up in the morning we'd both been awake a while and it took for me to say to him "aren't you going to wish me happy birthday" to say it to me but he'd basically started messaging the woman as soon as he woke up.  The same happened not yesterday but the day before, normally we spend the morning together. ( as I can't work and he's currently between jobs) but he hadn't spoke to me all morning, but was texting her. I saw the conversation and they weren't flirting from what I could see but it just made me feel like he was more interested in talking to her than spending time with me.  Now, we do both have a few trust issues, he's due to being hurt in past relationship and mine due to my mental illnesses. We know it's not a good thing and most of the time we are fine. He goes out and does whatever he does and I stay home as I don't go out much, and everything is fine.  But previously he has got annoyed and insecure about a male friend of mine and has asked me to block him on social media and not talk to him. So I did.  I'm not the type to be that way toward a partner but as I'm going through a rough patch and my head is all over the place which makes my insecurities strengthen, I asked him not to talk to her or at least not spend so much time talking to her. And he didn't exactly refuse but said he isn't disowning he's friends. Baring in mind we've been together a long time now and he speaks to me about all of his friends and I have never heard him mention her not once. So I'm thinking she must be a new friend. Maybe she's not even who he says she is. Anyway when I bought it up to him that when he asked me to not talk to my friend I stopped and respected how he felt about it and he's response was "well you can talk to him then". This bothers me because it seems to me that he thinks it's one rule for him and another for me. Why all of a sudden am I "aloud" to talk to my friend just because I pulled him up on the fact that I stopped talking to him when he asked but he won't do the same for me temporarily.  It's making me think he's interested in her in a way he shouldn't be if he's with me. He keeps saying "we are just friends" but myself and My male friend we generally just friends and he still didn't want me talking to him.  I don't know what to do or say or think. He has now blocked her number on his phone but I can't help but think he's either just changed the name of the contact to something else or he is talking to her else where on social media or something.  He says things like "I don't have many friends" blah blah blah.. but the point is I used to see my friends near enough everyday before we got together and after a while he didn't like me hanging out with them because there were often guys around which were friends of my friends. So I stopped seeing all of my friends. And when I tried to rebel and get him used to me seeing my friends for an hour or a half every now and then he'd be stressy and accuse me of cheating when I came home. (Baring in mind the friends I used to see live right next door, so it's not like I was out gallivanting.)   I know this all sounds childish and a lot of people will say we shouldn't be together if we can't trust each other but it hasn't been  a major problem until now.  And I don't want my jealousy to push him away, nor do I want these constant feelings that he's going behind my back, or he's going to get bored of me because I don't go out much so we can't do social things together which might lead him to wanting someone else because they can offer more than I can. And are more interesting or exciting than me.  I don't know what to do, the more I try not to let it bother me the more my mind finds little things to get jealous over.   I'm aware most of it is probably in my head or I'm just thinking too far into things but don't want this to come between us because other than the odd disagreement and this situation we get on really well and are (as far as I know) generally happy together.  I just can't handle my insecurities but it feels as though he's triggering them on purpose and it is probably in my head that he's triggering them because deep down I don't think he'd want me to feel this way but I can't kick these worries.   Does anyone else understand or expierence this? Does any one have any advice to calm my mind?   
I am feeling so alone, depressed, sad and completely hopeless. I am married and have 2 kids. i sometimes feel like if I could commit suicide it would end all my hurt and pain but i won't ever actually do that. I don't know what to do. I'm always looking for someone or something else to make me happy. I am either extremely happy or extremely sad. I got a job that paid extremely more than I usually make and I took it. Since I have been there everyone hates me because there has been a lot of change. It's to the point that they are trying to make me either quit or are looking for ways to fire me. I can't sleep, most of the time I don't eat and I never want to go to work or even get out of bed but I have to or my family will lose everything. I feel like every aspect of my life is horrible. I feel like my family thinks poorly of me. My job and the way people treat me there makes me want to end my life just to escape it. I feel like my husband doesn't really care about me or is oblivious when I am hurting. I actually try to reach out and have relationships with other men to get what I am lacking and I always think that ends up where I want their attention at all times and I don't get it so I get even more depressed. My husband pretty much does everything for my daughter and Its because I feel he thinks I can't do anything right and I'm always so depressed I also just set back and let him do it. If I could quit my job and not have to do anything or have a less stressful job and be able to work a job that doesn't have as many responsibilities just to have some stress lifted off my shoulders I feel that would be amazing but I am always searching for something to make me happy and nothing does. I'm not happy and don't know how to be. I can't make simple decisions. I looked online for questions to better know myself trying to find myself and I can't even answer most of the questions. What's wrong with me?  
Hi everyone   I went to see my psychiatrist yesterday and after me telling her about the advice I received on here she agreed to let me try 5mg of aripiprazole with the 100mg of sertraline....I'm really hoping this will be a good comby for me I just want to say a massive thank you to tess & Johnkov for their input and everyone else that has commented I really would of been lost without this forum xx 
I had a total knee replacement about 7 weeks ago and while I am doing well physically in my recovery I find myself becoming more and more depressed to the point where it is affecting my daily life and sleep is almost impossible even with Ambien that has been prescribed.    Has anyone else experienced this? 
I get really bad depression and feel so low some days where I don't want to carry on is anyone els going through this . 
I'm a mess. My psychiatrist has been adjusting my meds since they stopped working after the birth of my 2nd child. Was on Zoloft, increased dose, tried trintelix, Cymbalta, and most recently Remeron. I was supposed to go back to work in May but am on disability because of recurrent MDD. I was advised by email from dr to stop Remeron due to intolerance/horrific side effects. I don't see him for 2 more weeks. Now I'm medication free and I feel even more awful. I'm scared to be alone with my kids, I'm scared of my outbursts of anger and sadness that I can't control. I'm scared to be honest about these fears, especially to people who don't know my history. I'm petrified that if I seek emergency help my kids will be taken away. I don't believe my husband could manage without me and we have no other supports. I've had the luxury of being admitted to a facility in the past but that is not an option this time because of my kids. I'm not sure how to make it through the next couple of weeks. I've had MDD for most of my life but I've had medication/therapy to help. I've been thrown to the wind and am at a total loss. What do I do? Where do I go from here? How do I manage?? 
2days ago went up on Prozac  started again with side effects like when you first started taking it the usual sweating nervous wanting to know if every time you go up on dose if you have side effects again. 
I've had depression since I was 15, and discovered I had bpd (borderline personality disorder) since I was 18. I'm almost 20 now and Recently I had to stop taking my anti depressants because I couldn't afford them anymore and since then everything's gone downhill. Info smoke marijuana occasionally to help and it does , but there's still a lot of things I cannot cope with without self harming. I'm scared of becoming suicidal again. I'm constantly on the verge of tears or a breakdown . I have a wonderful boyfriend who loves me but because of my bpd if I don't see him for a day or two i shut down and ignore everyone until he comes back. And it's hard to act normal at work. And I had to switch doctors due to my insurance being on my dads side and I'm too scared to call for an appointment. I'm just so tired and done with everything I don't know why i shouldn't take an entire bottle of sleeping pills and get it over with. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so tired  
I was diagnosed with depression last May and have been on antidepressants ever since. I thought it was my job I was unhappy with but I'm still not back to myself even now.  I'm sick of feeling so low, down, worthless, and fed up. My cup is always half empty rather than half full and I can't escape negativity. All I seem to do is moan.  I'm 21 and surely shouldn't be feeling like this, I should be full of life and happiness.  I've had counselling and that didn't seem to do anything and I feel like I'm going to be stuck on Sertraline for the rest of my life.  I feel so alone even though I have the best family and friends I could wish for.  Any advice anyone?  
Hi! I'm very unhappy. I don't know if this is some kind of anxiety/depression or maybe psychosis... I often feel like some group of people are against me (usually people I like or people I want to be friend with) and that they have great reason to not like me/hate me. I ususally get ''paranoid'' and feel like even my best friend hides something but often I fast got over that and forgot about that ... but it's getting more and more often. Every day, another person ''has something against me''. And I feel like everyone knows that one thing about me that is enough to hate me Last week I was crying every day for hours and hours. And simply can't stop. I'm feeling extremly guilty for even searching something on google or for reading some blogs that wouldn't everyone. I'm feeling like my thoughts and mind are very wrong. I know that everyone have their good and bad thoughts and that is normal, but I feel like I'm very wrong person and deserves all this... I haven't hurt anyone in ''real life'' and nobody has ever told me that they hate me or that I'm wrong but I feel that they hide something all the time and that my life is a pure joke.  I feel disgusted by myself and sometimes feel suicidal. I'm feeling guilt and shame all the time. I feel like I hurt people! But I know I didn't... but my mind maybe play tricks with me? I'm feeling more and more sad and the one of the worst things for me is that my family is very upset about me. They can't watching me crying every day it hurts you know. But I just can't help myself anymore. I even sometimes scream so loud like I want to run away from myself. It's not fair for my family. I'm feeling like this for years but now it's worse and worse. I'm not on any medication. Thank you for any answer! 
I was asked many years ago, did I have suicidal thought , I said yes. What stops you the Psychiatrist asked. I have some lovely dreams where I am safe,loved and not suffering from Body Dysmorphic Disorder. That is why and your real world when awake is my hell. May sound strange , but that is how it is. 
I'm new here but I just need to vent. I hope none of you mind and if you do I am extreamly sorry.  Generally I have depression no matter the weather or season. But I glass Seasonal depression as part of my illness due to the fact that every single year around this time nearing winter my depression increases a lot.  The cold makes me feel sad, it may sound stupid but it literally gets under my skin and my depression hightens. The change in night to day makes me anxious. And the dim and dull days never seem to end.  Normally summer is my happiest time of the year. 'Y anxiety lowers and my depression is practically non exsistant.   This year summer was hard too. The heat made me anxious through fear of getting ill and everyone being social in the sun made me depressed because I can't enjoy the sunshine anymore.  So this year has been horrible. And it hasn't really had any high points for me.  All I can do is spend my days in bed. It's cold and miserable and I feel exhausted. I'm so low at the moment and I can't seem to kick it.  I was close to relapsing with my self harm earlier today. I managed to fight it off by getting my emotions out in another way.  I'm really struggling at the moment, and it feels like no matter how hard I try there's always something holding me back, holding me down.  I take a step forward and 20 steps back.  I know other people are in worse situations and I should be used to all of this by now, it has been 10 years after all. But I feel like I've been depressed for most of my life.  I got diagnosed when I was 12 and I'm still yet to find a therapy and medication that works. To stabilise my moods and make me feel "okay".  I wouldn't say I'm suicidal, but..  I do believe it would be easier for myself and my family and my boyfriend if I weren't here no more.  I'm a burden to everyone I care about.  That's a horrible feeling, knowing they'd be happier without me being around, without having to support me and make sure I don't do "stupid things".  I'm tired now. I'm tired of trying and failing. So I stopped trying and even now I'm still failing myself and my loved ones. I love them so much and it hurts me that I'm such a f*ck up.  I never did and don't want to be this way.  I just want to know what normal is.

I've been on them now for two months, and I've put on about 8 pounds. If I watch what I eat and up my activity, is it possible to lose weight whilst on them? 
this  is hard for me to type  this cause this is the first time ive spoke about this to anyone. The last few years about the time i turn 18. I started feeling like anything i do or say is never good enough or just sounds stupid. Through school i had very few friends if any i never hangout at friends parties or at school events I was very anti-social. I never had a real realationship that lasted. I got made fun of about 90% of  the time all the way through school until graduation. Unlike my other siblings i decided to go into the workforce instead of going into college. so my family started treating kinda different. They say they don't but to me it feels different like to there eyes I'm not good enough to them. When i turn 19 i got into contact with my biological father by the way he was never in my life; and all i wanted to know why he was never there for me.Then he started lying to me accusing of me of stuff that i didnt do. We lost contact; we haven't talked since. couple of monthes later i found out that he cares for two other kids thats not even his and he just met more than me. Made me feel like he didnt care and wasnt good enough to be his son. All my life all i wanted was to know why i was never good enough to be called his son for him to actually be there when i needed him the most but he cant be there for his new girlfriends kids. There more to it but its hard to put it into text. Now i feel like im alone cause im not the person my family wants me to be. Im feel like unwanted and not good enough cause the very few friends i did have dont want to hang out or my dad dont want to be in my life anymore. i just feel alone unsuccessful and unwanted. It has cause me to not be happy not to trust anyone anymore i don't want to be around anyone cause i feel stupid or worthless when im around people or my family. i lock myself in my room now and wonder if im worth anything to anyone and that i make my family happy if i disappeared. like i said its hard for me to put this into text cause this the first i talked about this to anyone. No one that knows me personally know how i feel about 100% of the time. i dont know if this is depression but if someone can give me some advice how to deal with this so i can feel like im worth something to my parents how to deal with feeling worthless and unwanted by my father. If you could seriously help please message me thank you. 
My senior year I had tons of friends and my boyfriend (Wich I still have) this was 2 years ago almost. I had been going to my best friends church and got close to the youth pastor.. my friend got jealous because she had a crush on him. We were 18 and he had just turned 21. She started to get jealous and stuff so she stopped talking to me. Well I me and my current boyfriend took a break from eachother.. during that break I was spending alot of time with my youth pastor and his group of friends. He had always seemed aggressive but it didn't ring me the wrong way until one night he took me home and took advantage of me infront of my house.. I told my bestfriend and she didn't believe me so ( at this point I had dropped out of school) she went to school and told all of our friends I was sphyco so everyone stopped talking to me. Me and my boyfriend were back together and so he's all I've had from then to now. Ever since then I've been overly attached to him because I don't have friends. I have delt with anger issues Wich I never had before and I cry all the time and I never get sleep. I haven't had a job in a couple months and I just feel hopeless. My whole world revolves around my boyfriend because he's the only thing I have to look forward to anymore. We have been together since we were 15 and we're 20 now. Hes about to leave for the airforce and I don't know what I'm going to do. He wants me to get friends and start doing more things so he isn't the only thing I have because he knows it's not normal either. He wants me to be happy and I want to be happy. I've had suicidal thoughts but I know I don't have the guts to do it. I've tried to get jobs nut it just never seems to work out. My car is broken so I'm stuck at the house. So it's like I wake up and wait for him to come save me. I can't live like this anymore, I want to have a normal and happy life with him. We're supposed to get married and move away when he comes back from basic training. But I want to be happy then when we start our new lives. And I don't want to be clung to him like I am. If anyone has advice please say something

Im 16, just started at a new college, suffer from depression, anxiety, an eating disorder, and i just find it all way to much to cope with. i feel like im on mute like i cant tell anyone how i feel without getting wierd looks or just ignored or talked over. im sick of feeling tired and frustrated with life. i recently lost my dog and i just feel empty since. she was my companion so i never felt alone but now i do. my bf suffers from an eating disorder, recently diagnosed, i find it hard to talk to him as i just feel guilty if i moan to him and tell him how crappy i feel, but it hard to keep supporting him and putting on a fake smile when i just feel empty and misserable. i struggle to sleep as i cant get my mind to shut off, i just feel like a mess and a dissapointment, fed up of feeling so alone... 
I find myself getting so depressed on the weekends I work full-time during the week but I have no family and all my close friends live out of town I just don't know what to do with myself on the weekends can only clean house and I'm not a big TV Watcher anybody else just get the blues on the weekends cuz there's just no one 
I have logged on here to try and make sense of how I am feeling and as I am feeling anxious, stressed, lonely, upset and am actually hiding in the offce at my work I really don't know what to do.  I lone work in a public library which is kiling me, I hate the isolation and have spoken to my boss's who know about my depression history but I feel my word are being shunned and I feel like a nuisance.  Being here on my own really gets me down, as we are a very quiet library which as little as 5 or 6 customers a day.  I am currently sitting in my office away from the windows and feeling so uptight and nervous (so hard to explain).  Can anyone help me? What options do I have.....otherwise I am seriously going to go out of my mind.  I want this pain to tend. 
I'm 15 years old and am having trouble. So basically right now in my life I feel as though I'm wasting my life because I do nothing. I'm depressed because family, feeling lonely and also feel like I have anhedonia. I am never happy, have no motivation, and feel emotionless. Like all I do is sit around my house. Summer is coming up and I have literally nothing to do but I want to use summer as a time to become normal and be happy and have emotions again because right now I'm always bored, sad, depressed. Ive posted these help messages before but nothing is helping. Like what can I do. Don't say join clubs because literally nothing in life seems interesting. I had friends but I lost interest and don't find them fun to be around because I feel like I don't matter so that's why I want a fresh start. My family is isolated and my parents always argue and my dad has a gambling addiction so I've never experienced vacations and new things. To be honest I've never really done anything in in my life. I always just sit at home because I can't drive or nothing. Please help! I probably have more than just depression because I got low self confidence and all that bad stuff. 
Hi everyone  I have been ill for 16 months it started with me nearly losing my youngest child,the anxiety took over and I went into a deep depression with anxiety and phsycosis I was put in hospital for a while,the last year I have tried different medications 4 weeks ago I started sertraline and have seen a big improvement with depression and anxiety but can't get pothe intrusive thoughts they are really strange think this is the end for me  
I think about killing myself every hour of every single day, and it's been like this for months now. I've thought about it for years, I've been in and out of therapy since 2007, but now it's just ridiculous. It was never Every Hour of Every Day.  I literally can't stand being alive anymore.  Lying there, day in day out with thoughts of death running through my mind, crying and feeling just utterly dead and heartbroken. I am So So lonely, so so unhappy and have no desire to achieve anything else.  I can't hold down a job, I screwed up uni, the love of my life has gone (and i don't blame her), i've got ridiculous debts that i can't pay off (and endless letters and phone calls from debt collection people that make me shake everytime i look at my phone or the mail), i'm terrifyed of other people (they call it paranoia, i call it 'being realistic'  i hate my stupid thin crappy body, i've lied to my family and wasted their money, i literally just want to die.   I researched suicide methods, attempted hanging (oh that went Really well), cutting is f***ing Pointless and looks ugly and doesn't work,  and i can't seem to figure out quite what to do. Or 'How to do it', would be a better way to put it.  And i'm not asking anyone to tell me.  Being so utterly miserable and lonely is, in itself, completely exhausting. I've seen councillors, taken pills, stopped taking pills. This isn't a cry for help, i don't know What this is. I guess it's just because i want to let out how i'm feeling to a bunch of strangers. A pointless rant. Fingers crossed for a heart attack or something.
