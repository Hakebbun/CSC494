 Eating Disorder Behavior Can Be a Form of Panic Attack by Joanna Poppink, MFT Retrieved February 2017 An OMG experience gives you more information about what's happening to you than the numbness an eating disorder provides. The Panic Attack Symptoms Nobody Talks About by Rachel Gearinger is a short, well written, candid article that may have powerful significance if you have or had an eating disorder. It's well known now that eating disorders can create a psychological numbness that dulls your senses and, for a short time, relieves stress. But you don't feel relief. You feel nothing. That dullness or numbness could be a form of depersonalization and/or derealization, a little discussed aspect of a panic attack. Please read the article and let me know what you think. joanna@poppink.com or below in the comments. If you think of your symptoms as a form of panic attack you could have a greater appreciation of your experience and what is triggering your behavior. You might think that ice cream or a buffet dinner or meeting new people are triggers for your eating disorder. But that doesn't give you more awareness of your situation. If you think those things trigger a panic attack in the form of eating disorder behaviors, you might start thinking of why or how these things would frighten you so much. When you start exploring the source of your fears you have the opportunity to build inner resources to cope with them. That process is an important aspect of eating disorder recovery psychotherapy and the road to your recovery. What occurs to you when you think of your eating disorder behaviors as panic attacks? 
 Releasing Anger in Eating Disorder Recovery by Z. Zoccolante, HealthyPlace February 1, 2017 At some point in your eating disorder recovery, you will need to release anger. Recovery is an interesting process and it can also be tough. When anger comes up, its important to know how to handle it so that it doesnt get stuck in your body and trigger eating disorder patterns (How to Channel Anger Constructively). Take a look at these helpful suggestions to help you release anger as it arises in your eating disorder recovery. Releasing Anger and Dealing with Depression in Eating Disorder Recovery When I was in the hospital for my eating disorder I remember a group leader telling us, Rage is anger turned outwards. Depression in anger turned inwards. It makes so much sense, especially for those of us whove been both anorexic and bulimic. Its like being a perfectionist for too long until were wound so tightly that we finally explode with rage in the form of external purging (How to Control Your Anger). Anger is a dangerous emotion because its the mask for sadness. When we take off the mask of our anger, usually we find that theres an ocean of sorrow beneath it. The reason we have masks in the first place is that we feel like they protect us. We often choose the anger because its the mask we think protects us from the sadness we dont want to feel. If you feel deeply angry then sadness is always brewing underneath (Sadness vs. Depression: Whats the Difference?). Why We Stay Angry Instead of Releasing Our Anger in Eating Disorder Recovery The reason we stay angry in eating disorder recovery is simple. We feel more powerful when were angry versus when were sad. When sadness overtakes us we can feel as though were floundering with our bellies exposed. Anger, on the other hand, gives us a sense of power and allows us to move with fire in our bellies. The problem with anger is that it holds a false sense of power. Often the angriest person in the room is also the saddest or the person who feels the most hurt and pain. Ways to Release Anger in Eating Disorder Recovery Do Five Wind Sprints I realize the irony of telling someone with an eating disorder to do a form of exercise, but if you are healthy enough and this will not trigger you, its a great one. Just a few sprints of 30-50 feet will help to clear some of that built-up aggression. 2) Throw Clay Against a Wall If you have a space to throw something safely, perhaps in your backyard or garage, hurling clay can be quite satisfying. If you can talk out loud, give a voice to whats going on internally before each throw. 3) Scream in Your Car This is one of my personal favorites. You can do this one with our without music playing over your stereo. You may want to sit in your driveway or park the car somewhere safe. Scream as loud as you can for as long as you can. Get that anger out. Usually, only a few screams will leave you feeling exhausted and energetically cleared out. You can also scream underwater in the ocean or your bathtub. The most important thing when youre releasing your anger in eating disorder recovery is to make sure that you are getting that anger moving out of your body. Feel it fully and then choose to let it go in whatever way feels best for you. Space is a vacuum and when we clear the anger we have more room for the good things like self-love, compassion, and greater strength for our recovery. 
 Eating Disorder Recovery Challenge: anesthesia or genuine human experience? by Joanna Poppink, MFT, Los Angeles eating disorder recovery psychotherapist June 14, 2016 If you want to start, improve or speed up your eating disorder recovery you may ask, "I know what I'm supposed to do and what I want to do. Why can't I do it?" This is a reasonable question. The answer is not because you are weak or not trying enough. Your solution is not about bearing down harder on the methods you are using, particularly will power and self criticism. Understanding what's really going on will help you get on and stay on your recovery path. When you set recovery goals for yourself without a real appreciation of the structural dynamics of your eating disorder you can set yourself up for frustration and what you consider to be failure. Your goals are based on wishful thinking about the strength of your will power. Your emotions have a powerful influence on whether your binge or starve. You may not be able to resist an urge to binge, You may be too terrified to eat at all. This is not weakness. This is finding yourself in a stressful situation that has gone too far. Whether your binge or starve you can believe that controlling, minimizing or eliminating your normal human emotions will free you from your eating disorder behaviors. Some people think or wish that success in giving up eating disorder behaviors is equal to becoming automatons with no feelings and a surface facade of agreeable charm. If this is you, your goal is to create yourself as an anesthetized presence with a pleasant smile and perfect body. Human feelings of fear, stress, pain, greed, rage, love, need, shame, vulnerability, separation and rushes of grandiosity or inferiority would then pose no difficulty. None of the emotional triggers for your eating disorder behaviors could exist in your anesthetized state. If you could make this condition your daily normal experience you believe you would not need your eating disorder and you would, at last, be free of your self-criticism and growing despair. However, this dream is a paradox, a tricky twist based on the actual structure of your eating disorder. Your eating disorder contributes to creating your anesthesia and functions to block you from your feelings. Your actual question is: "How can I be numb without using the eating disorder as an anesthetic?" In other words, you are asking for a substitute anesthetic. This is not only frustrating but dangerous since, in early recovery stages, people caught in looking for a substitute anesthetic, may experiment with substituting eating disorder behaviors with sex, drugs and alcohol behaviors. So what is the answer and how do you meet your recovery challenges? Before you can know and recognize your feelings, especially your trigger feelings, you need to be open to accepting yourself as a human being. You don't have to understand what that means right away. You just have to accept the fact that you are human and are about to learn what being human really means. Putting yourself, not only at the beginning of recovery, but at the beginning of understanding the nature of being human, gives you a solid place to stand in your learning and healing. You can relieve yourself of impossible expectation burdens you've been carrying about yourself and start at your realistic beginning. False assumptions can go. About Being Human Healthy humans feel the full range of what humans are capable of feeling. To be healthy and live a full life you need to be able to access your feelings, tolerate them and be able to think, make choices and function at the same time. Otherwise, the automaton is in charge. Choices that lead to painful or destructive consequences are made through oblivion since automatons don't feel anything and so don't consider painful results a consideration. If the automaton is you, trying to pass as an unfeeling creation, you will find yourself dealing with bewildering and painful situations. Your recovery work in your psychotherapy is about understanding and learning to live and function with feelings you can't yet bear. Sometimes, to avoid those feelings because they are uncomfortable or painful or set off an anxiety or a panic attack, you will seek a rush. You will put yourself in a high stress or high drama situation full of illogic, unpredictability and high risk. In such a situation you will be aware of powerful sensations that convince you that you are not numb and that you are feeling emotions. But the extreme sensations that flood your system are a device to block or numb your authentic human emotions. If you find yourself in highly dramatic, dangerous, exciting, frightening or exhilarating situations you may well be flooding yourself to avoid experiencing your unbearable emotions. You may be avoiding even the knowledge that those emotions exist. Eating disorder behavior may be an attempt to avoid feelings and risks, but the eating disorder thinking and behavior creates risk to life, health and happiness. The Only Option Living a satisfying life, free to pursue your deeply valued desires, requires a real presence in life. Becoming a nonhuman is not an option. The only option for healing and life is to become a more evolved human. When you reach the point in your recovery work that you acknowledge to yourself that personal evolution is your goal, recovery speed picks up. As you embrace your humanity you learn to recognize feelings and bear them in genuine life situations. When you can feel and think at the same time you can rally your courage to make choices that permit you to strive for your true heart's desire. As a clinician, I have learned that once my client's goal is to outgrow the limitations that make her eating disorder necessary, we can cooperate with the power of evolution. We can reach for a more solid and clear presence in her relationship not only with food but with a full range of people, experiences and surprises life presents to all of us. Once you are on this path, teachers, helpers, benefactors, and opportunities for right action, invisible to controlling perceptions, seem to synchronistically appear as you awaken to your true nature, speak your truth and honor yourself. This is not magic. This occurs because perception based on authentic feeling is more clear than perception based on an anesthetized condition. You are now attracted to and attract people and situations that are healthy and that encourage even more health in you. From this evolving place former eating disorder habits fall away. A more realistic and healthy life begins. At this point you appreciate your humanity, use all your feelings as information, make decisions based on thought and feeling, and live a more satisfying, and genuine life. The eating disorder is gone. You've evolved beyond it. 
 'It's not in the shadows any longer': New support for men with eating disorders Wallis Snowdon Jun 08, 2016 Trevor Schmidt began starving himself in his late 20s. He would go days without touching food, ignoring hunger pangs until they became unbearable. In a matter of weeks, he lost more than 20 pounds. "There is a sense of control that you have when you limit yourself from eating, or punish yourself from eating too much," he said. "At various points in my life, it was the only thing I felt I had control over." Schmidt is just one of the Edmonton men benefiting from a new support group by the Eating Disorder Support Network of Alberta (EDSNA). The session is intended to help men struggling with body-image issues, and reduce the stigma for men suffering from disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. "There is a lot of stigma and shame associated with any mental illness, and I think there is a common misconception out there that eating disorders only affect women," said Sue Huff, executive director of EDSNA. "So, when men are struggling with this, they experience double levels of shame and stigma, and it's difficult to admit that it's happening and reach out for help." Huff said eating disorders often manifest differently in men, making them harder to diagnose — leaving too many men to suffer in silence. The session is just a pilot, but Huff hopes to make it a permanent fixture at the clinic. "Men may punish themselves in different ways, but at the end of the day it's a very dysfunctional relationship with food, and that's the same whether male or female," Huff said during an interview on CBC Radio's Edmonton AM. "We're hoping to reach the men, we know they're out there." 'I was losing my identity' Though Schmidt's eating disorder didn't manifest itself until later, he thinks the seeds of his obsession began in early childhood. "My parents were extremely healthy, before that was a 'thing,' and my father was involved in bodybuilding. And I think that caused a bit of a disturbance in psyche about body image," Schmidt said. "I was also extremely small, and that became an identity for me. So as I got older, when my metabolism changed, and my body changed, it really struck a chord that I was losing my identity." When he started gaining weight in his mid 20s, it came as a shock. Aloof comments from old friends, suggesting he'd put on a few pounds, felt like daggers. "Of course, we've all put on weight over the last 25 years, but even now, it's like a knife in my big fat heart." But even as his obsession began to overtake his life, it would be months before Schmidt recognized the disease for what it was, and got professional help. "I don't like throwing up, so I just stopped eating," he said. "My weight kept creeping up because I was starving and bingeing. One day, my mom asked me if I was 200 pounds, and I stood on a scale and realized I was 180 pounds. I was horrified." Years after his diagnosis, he now maintains healthy weight and eating habits, but his obsession with food persists. He hopes by sharing his story, other men will decide to face their illness. "It's not in the shadows any longer. I hope people will be getting help for it." 
 Triggers in Eating Disorder Recovery by Z Zoccolante, Surviving ED, HealthyPlace April 6, 2016 There are many triggers in eating disorder recovery. Two common themes for those with eating disorders are a repulsion of fat and negative or distorted body image. Recovery includes adjusting our thoughts and feelings around these two, in spite of eating disorder triggers. It’s important to note, however, that no two people recover exactly the same way. Last week we talked about weight gain during recovery and viewing ourselves in the mirror (How to Deal with Weight Changes In Eating Disorder Recovery). One person told me that that they couldn’t look in the mirror because it made them want to cry. This made my heart hurt because it’s an honest, raw, and legitimate feeling. Many of us have experienced this feeling, myself included, and it’s a source of deep sorrow. So, how do we keep moving forward with triggers in eating disorder recovery? Acknowledge Your Feelings and Triggers in Eating Disorder Recovery First, it’s vital to acknowledge that our feelings and triggers are legitimate and valid (Mental Illness Validation: I Believe You). When we’ve committed to eating disorder recovery it doesn’t mean that we’re going to like it, especially at first. There will be times when we want to go back to our old patterns. There will be times when we miss our eating-disordered body, despite the fact that it was unhealthy or even destructive for us. We will miss our old life, even if it was killing us. I know we all know what I mean. It’s Okay to Be Scared of Eating Disorder Recovery Triggers Recovery is scary because it’s a whole new process. We’re giving up the control that we once so desperately sought and tried to keep a handle on. It’s okay to acknowledge that it sucks. It’s okay to be honest and say that we’re terrified of our body becoming a balloon, or of facing the emotional stuff we’ve been stuffing, starving, or throwing up (What The Mirror Shows Me in Eating Disorder Recovery). It’s Okay to Mourn the Loss of the Eating Disorder It’s okay to mourn the loss of the eating disorder; because, after all, it did serve a purpose. It was the best way that, at that point in time, we felt we could protect ourselves from the world. We’re not stupid. We just chose something that would provide us comfort, safety, control, or fill-in-the-blank we sought at our time of distress. Maybe we were grasping at straws and the eating disorder was the one that our fingers pulled. The eating disorder has been a close, intimate friend, and now we’re saying goodbye. It’s okay to mourn the loss of a friend, and to remember the reason we’re choosing to walk away. The relationship no longer serves us (Eating Disorder Recovery: Getting Better and Losing Friends). If we continue, it will destroy us mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. It will take us down, to the grave. It’s Okay to Handle Eating Disorder Triggers Your Way Although we share a common pool of eating disordered criteria, every person is unique. To the person who can’t look at their body in the mirror without crying, maybe mirrors trigger you or don’t feel like you have a safe space right now. That’s okay. Start your recovery where you feel comfortable and begin to expand that comfort zone (Body Image and Acceptance in Eating Disorder Recovery). Maybe for a while you can cover, or remove, all the full-length mirrors in your house. Maybe your recovery breakthrough will be more focused on how you feel in your body instead of coming to a contrived peace with what you see in the mirror. 
 A Simple Mantra for Eating Disorder Recovery by Z Zoccolante, Surviving ED, HealthyPlace March 9, 2016 Have you considered a simple mantra for eating disorder recovery? Eating disorder recovery can feel like a battle  because it is. We choose to go against the destructive voice that was once our friend. We choose to sit with uncomfortable feelings and emotions, and not reach for our easy coping tool. We choose to live in our bodies as they shift and change and as they learn to regulate and be without the disorder. Some days its tough, but we have to keep in mind what were fighting for. We have to keep in mind our end goal. Having an eating disorder recovery mantra can help (Mantras and Recovery: Mind Over Whats The Matter). An Eating Disorder Recovery Mantra for Freedom and Happiness My recovery was fought for freedom and happiness, the two things I wanted that kept eluding me during my disorder. I recovered a step at a time, sticking a toe into recovery and then retracting my commitment. Then, one day, when I finally knew too much, the seesaw tipped and had to recover. Id tried every angle, path, loop, and underground tunnel. The end result of every fractaled variation of the eating disordered behavior ended in sadness. This was when I knew I had to try something different. What I wanted wasnt found in whittling down my body fat, sticking my head over the toilet, watching all my food, or exercising till the eating disorder let me stop. All current roads led to sadness, but I wanted to be free. So I had to try recovery. During that time, I had a little mantra. I wrote it on my mirror and repeated it three times: Kindness Matters. Its a simple phrase, but its one we forget. Often, were warm, loving, and compassionate with others, but then forget to include ourselves in that bubble of kindness. This simple eating disorder recovery mantra is a powerful tool to help us through tough days, when were down about our bodies or feel blah about the whole process of getting, and staying, healthy. An Eating Disorder Recovery Mantra for Negative Body Days Every woman Ive talked with seems to shift from having happy days to suddenly being down on their bodies, which includes awful body image (The Physical Aspects of Anorexia Disorder Recovery), self-hate, cruel self-talk, and nitpicking at themselves. This shift has been triggered (Navigating Triggers During Eating Disorder Recovery), but a lot of people arent aware of that trigger so the shift seems to take place out of the blue. I recall a time I was backpacking through Europe for a month and eating ice cream every day. Then, when I got to my study abroad destination, I couldnt fit into one of my pairs of jeans. A meltdown ensued with me crying on the floor, telling myself horrible things about what a worthless failure Id become and vowing to lose weight immediately. An Eating Disorder Recovery Mantra for Encouragement What I needed most was kindness (5 Ways to Approach Triggering Emotions). I needed to be able to talk to myself as though I would encourage a friend. I needed to hear something like, Hey self, youre doing a great job. Youve been living. You havent been throwing up. Youve collected memories, smiles, and belly laughs. Youve eaten pear ice cream, walked down cobblestone streets, and had a cinnamon cone by the river. Youre much more than the circumference of your thighs. And yes, I know youre sad and its okay to cry. But were not going to be cruel to ourselves. Were going to treat ourselves as someone we love. This body is your home and you want to live in a happy home. If we can invite kindness back to the conversation, we can face recovery with confidence. Whatever happens, even if it feels like we take two steps forward and one step back, we can hold our own hand through the process. We can remind ourselves that were doing a great job. Kindness Matters. Kindness Matters. Kindness Matters. 
 How To Put Your Eating Disorder Recovery First by Jessica Hudgens, HealthyPlace.com Jan 15, 2015 First, lets recap why it is so important for you to put your recovery first. In short, your eating disorder affects every area of your life. Anorexia, bulimia, binge eating, and other eating disorders will destroy the things most important to you (and in short order!), so you need to spend just as much time and energy on your recovery as you did acting on your eating disorder. Which, while it surely felt second nature and automatic (and therefore probably felt like you spent no time at all on it), was a tremendous amount of time. My basic philosophy for prioritizing your eating disorder recovery can be summed up in three words: Recovery First. Always. The cornerstones of your recovery are nutrition (AKA eating without compensation) and appointments with your treatment team. These things should be scheduled before anything else on your calendar. This might leave you with some uncomfortable choices. For example: Early in my recovery, I was looking for a job and was finally offered the exact position I wanted in a preschool. However, the hours would have conflicted with the hours my therapist and dietitian were open. After talking with the school, there wasnt much they could do in the way of changing the hours, so I had to turn them (and the steady paycheck) down.I have, on more than one occasion, had dinner in my therapists office because of the timing of our sessions. It also really forced me to challenge the shame I felt about eating around other people.On the first day of classes last year, I had to approach my professors and tell them I would have to eat meals and snacks in class. Not only that, but if they found this disruptive, I would have to be excused to eat in the hallway. Not eating? Not an option. (Thankfully, all of my professors are great about it and actually encourage it!) What If I Cant Put My Recovery First? There have certainly been times in my life when it felt like I couldnt put recovery first. At some times it was because I didnt have the skills or support to make recovery happen; at others, it was because I didnt have the mental, emotional, or physical energy required to do so. Regardless of the reason, if you arent able to prioritize your recovery (and/or arent making good progress) in your current treatment situation, it may be time to change things. It may mean adding a second (or third) appointment each week with your therapist or seeing your psychiatrist every other week instead of every month. It may mean finding a treatment center near you where you can go a few nights a week for extra meal support and education. Or it may mean taking weeks or months away from home and doing a residential or inpatient stay to get your recovery going. I should note here that there is no shame in choosing any of these options if they are called for. A lot of us as sufferers, especially those of us who have been in recovery for some period of time, feel that increasing the time we are spending in treatment is a step backwards. Its not. Its a wise, recovery-oriented decision that ensures you keep your recovery first. Putting My Own Recovery First That said, I certainly understand the feeling of shame. I am struggling with it some myself now. I had to make the decision to drop a class prior to the start of the semester, knowing that the subject content could be triggering and that I am simply not equipped mentally or emotionally to take an extra class beyond the minimum required. While I am by no means back in my anorexia, I can certainly recognize areas where I have slipped and areas I need to prioritize to be at my prime physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. So for me, putting recovery first right now means a lighter workload. Even if that keeps me in school longer and it feels like a waste of money. Recovery first. Always. 
 Are more men getting eating disorders? by David Cox, The Guardian Sunday 18 January 2015 Somewhere deep within me is a destructive urge, says Colin. Its this gremlin in my head that hits me at unexpected moments. Ultimately, complete recovery requires changing my perception of myself. It is going to be a struggle, but its achievable. Colin is a 50-year-old community development manager, and has battled an eating disorder for more than two decades. Eating disorders have long been perceived as an issue affecting women and girls, but this idea has been shown to be increasingly warped: the number of men being diagnosed has risen by 27% since 2000. Typically, this has been interpreted as a stark reflection of increasing pressure on men to care more about their image, but the truth is perhaps more complex. Are cases of male eating disorders really increasing or are we simply getting better at recognising them? Statistics tell us that anorexia, for example, is 10 times more common in women than men, but we are preconditioned not to expect it in the latter. Then there is emotional overeating  far more common than either anorexia or bulimia  but which has only recently become the subject of serious research. One of our concerns is that diagnostic criteria for eating disorders are entirely based on female traits, explains Nadia Micali, a senior lecturer at the Behavioural and Brain Sciences Unit at University College London. To get an anorexia diagnosis, you need to be afraid of getting fat. But masculine concerns can include wanting a lean or defined physique, and males who become fixated with achieving that by excessive use of supplements, hormones or starvation may be dismissed by doctors. A number of men with eating disorders report reactions ranging from mild disbelief to outward aggression when they seek help. Many are branded as attention seekers, which only hastens a rapid decline in mental health. One of the reasons I relapsed was because I still have a continual fear of being a fraud, says Dave, a 25-year-old standup comedian, recovering from anorexia. When I first went to a GP with heart palpitations and low body temperature, I was told to buy a good jumper and cut down on coffee, and was shown the door. I now have a great doctor, who is understanding, but that constant fear that it was me and that I wasnt anorexic at all, made me try more and more dangerous ways of controlling what I ate and losing weight. The prevailing stereotype paints a picture of anorexia as largely a 21st-century phenomenon, a disease predominantly affecting white, teenage girls from comfortable, middle-class family backgrounds, with the western luxury of being able to control what they eat. We are led to believe it arises entirely due to the pressures of modern-day image ideals, and our persistent obsession in equating slim with beautiful. The reality is that anorexia is a mental disorder that has existed for centuries. It is neither gender nor geographically specific, and while it is most common in those aged 15-30, it can occur in older age groups too. And our perception of it as a female disease is, in fact, surprisingly recent. The first recorded case of anorexia was in 1649 when Richard Morton, a London physician, noted the symptoms of a young man. Morton described it as a nervous consumption and continued to record cases throughout his life. His notes refer to a wasting of the body without any remarkable fever, cough or shortness of breath and speculate on a link to the cares and passions of the mind. Anorexics themselves often reject the concept that their disorder has been triggered by the predominance of certain body types in magazines and adverts. Instead, it is a gradual process, where they slip into an addictive mindset of associating weight loss with both internal and external approval. This acts as a coping mechanism for some underlying trauma, which may range from the end of a relationship, bullying, loneliness, bereavement or general low self-esteem. The sensationalisation of eating disorders and, in the case of anorexia, creating the idea that you arent ill unless you are visibly emaciated adds to the problem. Anorexics dont necessarily have to look skinny, in the same way that you dont have to be in bandages to be genuinely ill, says Dave. Eating disorders may spring from a combination of nature and nurture, but it is thought that certain personality characteristics predispose people to them. Given that just 30-40% of those with eating disorders receive treatment, there is a growing drive across the US and the UK to collect blood samples and pinpoint genes that may indicate vulnerability. Part of the anorexic mindset is the competitive mindset, says Richard, a 24-year-old accounts manager. Its like a game and when I feel Im winning at it, controlling my hunger and overcoming the feeling of needing sustenance can become an almost spiritual experience. In my own mind, there is no drug or sensation like it. But its a game I can never win.  We should look at anorexia in the same way that we do bronchitis or sports injuries, Dave says. During my worst phases, I just wished I could have read something down to earth on the subject, something that said: There is nothing to be ashamed of. This is what it is, these are the risks and if you are worried, here is a helpline and how to get treatment. Men Get Eating Disorders Too is a national (UK) charity that supports men with eating disorders and their families. 
 New Eating Disorder Guidelines Released Medscape Medical News December 05, 2014 The first eating disorder guidelines to incorporate the latest recommendations from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), including the new disorder of avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), have been released. Produced by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, the guidelines are evidence-based, multidisciplinary, and include consideration of recovery-oriented practice, with a special focus on anorexia nervosa (AN). "One thing that is new and quite distinctive about these guidelines is that we have approached anorexia nervosa from the perspective of child and adolescent anorexia nervosa, anorexia nervosa in adults, and also severe and enduring anorexia nervosa, because the treatment approaches and the outcomes differ by clinically important ways," lead author Phillipa Hay, MD, told Medscape Medical News. "People realize that...there are really quite important differences both in terms of approaches in child or adolescent and adults and also the small proportion who go on to have severe and enduring illness," she added. Another major change has been the expansion of the guidelines to include bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder, as well other related disorders. "The other thing, of course, was the DSM-5 and the way eating disorders are conceptualized and the broadening of the diagnostic criteria. Thats an important aspect that's needed to be reflected in the guidelines and updated for clinicians." The guidelines are published in the November issue of the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry. Anorexia Management According to the guidelines, the management of AN should depend on the severity of the disorder and the age of the patient. These latest recommendations update previous guidelines published in 2009, which were developed specifically for AN. Expanding the reach of the current guidelines to include other eating disorders, Dr Hay, who is foundation chair of mental health, School of Medicine and Centre for Health Research, University of Western Sydney, Australia, and colleagues conducted a systematic review of the literature, identifying 21 articles for inclusion. A multidisciplinary working group then wrote draft clinical practice guidelines, which underwent community, expert, and stakeholder consultation, allowing the identification of additional evidence for best practice. Emphasizing the need for a wide-ranging approach to the management of patients with eating disorders, the authors note that there are several principles guiding treatment. These are as follows: Person-centered informed decision-makingThe involvement of family and significant othersRecovery-oriented practice, maximizing self-determination and self-managementLeast restrictive treatment, best suited to an individual's needsA multidisciplinary approachStepped and seamless care, building on strong links with primary care as well as general hospital and community care providersA culturally informed approach to diagnosis and treatmentIndigenous care, demonstrating "cultural competence" when working with people from different backgrounds New Disorder The guidelines also incorporate ARFID, a new disorder in the DSM-5. Although there is not a great deal of literature on ARFID, Dr Hay and colleagues felt that it was important to include it in the new guidelines. "We needed to have it there so that clinicians are aware of it as a disorder ― what it is and how to conceptualize it ― so that they can start seeing, identifying it, and start learning about its epidemiology and treatment," said Dr Hay. Finally, Dr Hay touched on the principle of least restrictive care, which is another notable change to the guidelines since their previous iteration. "Currently, the model for practice in Australia and New Zealand psychiatry is to treat people with the least intrusive and least restrictive environment," she explained. "We are really moving to try to do that as much as possible with anorexia nervosa, supporting people in the community with intensive outpatients or day patients treatment approaches, and reserving hospital only for those who are medically compromised and will sometimes need more intensive care." Looking more broadly at the growing body of literature on AN, Dr Hay believes that patient outcomes can be good. "Particularly in child and adolescent anorexia nervosa, we can be really quite optimistic and quite positive about treatment outcomes and about the efficacy of treatment," she said. "We have some good evidence-based treatments, particularly in child and adolescence anorexia nervosa, particularly with family-based approaches.... We do know that treatments work and that specialist treatments work." "We don't quite have that to the same degree in adult anorexia nervosa, but we do know that individual psychological therapies provided by specialists with specialist expertise are effective, and are certainly better than doing nothing or doing very little," she added. Need for More Research As well as clinical practice recommendations, the new guidelines stress the importance of further research into eating disorders, particularly for ARFID. Nevertheless, Dr Hay is hopeful that a number of randomized controlled trials that are currently under way, many of which are comparing psychological therapies, will prove enlightening. "I suspect over the next few years, we'll start to work out that specialist supportive clinical management is a very good initial psychological therapy and maybe sufficient for many people with anorexia nervosa, but not for all." "Some will require perhaps more intensive therapies, such as with cognitive-behavior therapy or with Maudsley adult therapy or focal psychodynamic therapy," she added. Further down the line, Dr Hay is working with Steven Childs at the University of Sydney on the concept of staging AN. Noting that the DSM-5 does not specify a clear upper weight cutoff for the disorder, Dr. Hay said: "People who may be not so very underweight, with body mass indices closer to the normal range, around 18, for example, would have quite different treatment needs and treatment approaches than people who have a body mass index right down at the level of about 13." "I think we are realizing that anorexia nervosa does have these different stages, these different clinical syndromes...and that has an impact upon treatment needs [in terms of] what you do and how quickly you may act, or not." The authors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. Aust N Z J Psychiatry. 2014;48:977-1008. Full text 
 Coping at Christmas: The Men With Eating Disorders Suffering in Silence Sam Thomas Founder and Director of Men Get Eating Disorders Too 07/12/2014 Christmas can be a difficult time for those who are suffering from an eating disorder, particularly for the men who are suffering in silence. This year, Men Get Eating Disorders Too (MGEDT), is reaching out to sufferers so they can be less isolated this festive season. As a former sufferer of bulimia, I know first-hand how the focus of food can play havoc on the mental wellbeing of those suffering at this time of year. From roast turkey, tins of sweets and mince pies - the temptation for excess of food is irresistible for many. However, for those suffering with anorexia and bulimia, the constant reminders of food can feel like never ending pain and torture. The time to be joyful is anything but that. There was a time when I used to dread Christmas- months ahead of the big day. Talking to our service users I'd realised it was a common anxiety. Keith, a binge eater, told me: "I think this is something that has been going on since my childhood when often the Christmas week meant that shops were closed and you couldn't get to a shop to buy food for the whole week. That meant that people would stock up in preparation for a few days of 'feasting' before they could go and get the staples in when the supermarkets reopened. Of course now there is only a small amount of time that the shops close so there is no need to do the bulk buys like the past." It's important to remember Christmas only lasts a couple of days and will pass by quickly. Despite feeling like a life sentence, living with an eating disorder need not be. By recognising you have a problem and speaking with others will help in those first steps towards support and recovery. For those concerned about a loved one Christmas is a daunting time for someone with an eating disorder, and what the person needs is compassion and understanding from those around them. Breaking with tradition can be worthwhile if it allows the person freedom around food and eating - what matters is that the person feels they can cope, not that they eat 'normally' Discussing some more with a friend of mine in the USA, a young rep for the National Eating Disorders Association and MGEDT Ambassador, he reassured me and other sufferers this festive season. Troy Roness said: "While I was in the depths of my illness, the holidays were especially difficult. My every thought, action, and moment were held captive to my eating disorder. I dolled-out hollow smiles and fake laughs to further the facade that I was 'fine.' However, my mind was never more than two seconds away from what I would or would not eat, where my access to the gym would come from, and how I would 'take care' of my indulgences during the holiday season. "Little did I know, though, that my thoughts about family, friends, and enjoying myself were not indulgences at all - they were human and very, very normal. My eating disorder forced me to believe that I was a horrible person for wanting to enjoy life, especially at a time when family and friends provide the most support. An eating disorder, no matter what time of the year, is nothing short of self-punishment. But during the holidays, they can be especially difficult. Seek out your support systems, talk about how you are feeling, and utilize the tools you feel comfortable with to enjoy the time you need and deserve." As so much of the holiday season is celebrated with food and meals, it can be a particularly stressful time for someone suffering from an eating disorder. Traditional practices can provoke an extraordinary amount of anxiety and make a vulnerable person much more prone to crisis. This is a time of year when sufferers need extra understanding, compassion, and support. If you are worried about yourself this festive season, here are some tips on how to cope: - Try to keep some perspective - worse things have happened. - Know that it is not forever - even this will fade into memory. - Know that you are not entirely responsible for yourself - no-one is an island. - Remember that no-one is watching or judging you - in all likelihood they've got their own worries. - Try to stay calm - this isn't worth getting upset over. - It will get easier with time. - You will come out the other side stronger. Regardless whether you are home with family or alone at home this Christmas, you can reach out for help, during the Christmas period. You are not alone and nor should you feel that you are. For more information and support this Christmas please visit Men Get Eating Disorders Too | Supporting men with eating disorders, carers and their families to get their voices heard Live chat one-to-one sessions will take place on Wednesday evenings, 7-8.30pm, and extra sessions over the festive period. Please consider donating to the MGEDT Christmas Appeal via Just Giving. For every pound it will help one more person seek the support they need.

 I am anemic. I also struggle with eating disorders so that makes it hard to treat the anemia, but I am taking the vitamin supplements the doctor recommended. I know this is probably pica. I have struggled with ice cravings in the past. I just want to eat chalk really badly. It's gross and weird and disturbing. I'm not sure why I'm even posting this because there aren't really any answers for it. Ugh. Just venting I guess. 
 The Role of Self-Acceptance in Recovering From Eating Disorders By Deborah Klinger, MA, at GoodTherapy.org March 18, 2010 People who struggle with eating and food issues often also struggle with poor self-esteem. I say poor rather than low because I believe the concept of high and low self-esteem to be problematic. If low self-esteem means perceiving ones self to be inferior to others, it follows that high self-esteem means perceiving ones self to be superior to others. Healthy self-esteem is neither high nor low. It is defined by the lack of concern about ones worth, coupled with a sense of competence and a belief in ones innate value. When a person is comfortable in their own skin, without worrying about whether they are good enough, being neither better nor worse than anyone else, thats good, solid, healthy self-esteem. Years ago, I worked for a foster care agency, where I taught classes to prospective foster parents. Our agency used an excellent curriculum called Model Approaches to Partnerships in Parenting (MAPP). MAPP was designed to help prospective foster parents understand the experience of children coming to live in their home. One of the MAPP modules was on self-esteem. It explained that, in order for a child to develop a sense of healthy self-esteem, they have to be taught, by virtue of the way they are treated by parents and caregivers, that they are four things: loveable, capable, responsible, and worthwhile. Its not just about what children are told, its also about how they are treated, and what kinds of responsibilities they are given, and when. Getting three out of these four isnt enough. Its like a dining room table: all four legs are needed for it to work as designed. When parents arent able, whether because of their own experiences, or by circumstances that interfere with their ability to parent well, to convey to their kids that they are these four things, children look outside themselves for indicators that they are good enough. They compare themselves to others using the criteria available: the grades they make, athletic abilities, physical appearance, popularity. When eating problems develop, comparing ones self to others intensifies. The act of comparing functions as an attempt to decrease feelings of insecurity and anxiety. The person who struggles with eating and food issues usually compares his/her body size and shape to others. A smaller body means relief and reassurance; and a bigger body means anxiety and shame. A person with an eating disorder judges him/herself harshly, to keep him or herself in line with food and exercise. This judgment erodes self-esteem even further, and perpetuates an unhealthy relationship with food and body. The antidote is self-acceptance. This is bedrock. It means zero self-judgment, no self-criticism, no comparing to others, no using external criteria as indicators of worth or value. It means affirming that, No matter what I do, think, feel, say, or look like, I deeply and completely accept myself. Its not about whether one is acceptable in the eyes of others. The active practice of accepting ones self is healing. Acceptance doesnt mean liking or approving of something. It means not fighting reality. Not fighting the body one is living in today, or flagellating ones self for eating or exercise behaviors, but simply acknowledging, without any judgment, what is. It is axiomatic that nothing can change unless and until it is first accepted. The idea of self-acceptance often raises concerns: If I accept myself as I am, its condoning unhealthy behaviors. If I accept myself, Ill never be motivated to change. I cant accept my [body/behavior] because I find it repulsive. I have to improve it before I can accept it. Ive often said that Ive never seen anyone whip or beat themselves into making positive changes. Practicing non-judgment of ones self creates a safe space, an arena in which there is no pressure to better ones self, but, instead, have an opportunity to heal. 
 and they treat you very badly because of it. It is not a moral failure. It is a mental illness and not something someone chooses. Who would want to end up with an eating disorder that slowly or quickly destroys your life if you don't get treatment for it? Not me. I sure did not mean to end up the way I have. I need help with this. I can't overcome it myself. It's not about willpower. It's about deep inner pain and control and hatred of self. That is what I need to overcome and I need help doing that. I hope this makes sense. 
 Self-Soothing Kits – Preparing for bad days by Nikki Paulie March 26, 2013 One of my favorite things to suggest to client, especially for dealing with bad days are Self-Soothing Kits. These are good when you’re feeling down and need a pick me up, when you have an urge to binge or purge with eating disorders, or have urges to self-harm. When we are feeling down, or low, that is not the time we tend to think to ourselves, “you know what would really make me feel better? Painting my nails, or calling a friend.” When we’re feeling low, we either want to just curl up in bed and ignore the world, or we want something that is instant and gratifying. We tend to turn to what we know, or use most often. If we’re suffering from mental health problems at the moment, usually that quick choice is not a healthy one. So, for those bad days, I bring you “How to build your own Self-Soothing Kit.” These can also be made as “safety kits” for people who are trying to avoid self-harming, sobriety kits for people who are trying to avoid giving into urges to drink or use drugs. Important tips to keep in mind There are a few things to keep in mind when building your self-soothing kit. It should be placed somewhere that you have easy access to, and should be stored in something portable, whether it’s a shoe box or a basket. Your self-soothing kit should also include things that allow you to use all 5 senses: sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell. Also, this is a kit to be made especially for you, so it should only include things that will make you feel better. Allows this to be a time for you to be creative, and really get in touch with yourself. Think about the things you really enjoy. Once your kit is made, you can always add to it later, or change it with time. You might find that there are some things that make you feel better in sometimes, and as you get older you start preferring other things, and that’s okay! Creation Here are some examples of some things you could include in your kit. These are just some ideas to get your creation going. Sight A rock, or gem that you enjoy looking at Decorated stationary for writing letters to friends, loved ones, or even yourself. This could also be a decorated journal. Photos of your close friends or family members, photos of fond memories or happy moments. InspirationalQuotes, see my Happy Thoughts tab for inspiration, feel free to print any of the quotes off for your kit. Your favorite book Pictures of funny cat or dog memes from the internet, or a written link to that YouTube video you can’t stop laughing at when you watch it. A fun magazine Comic strips Hearing A Meditation Recording. Check out UCLA’s Mindful Aware Research Center for some free guided meditations.Songs that make you feel happy or relaxed. Taste A variety of herbal teas A small piece of your favorite candy or chocolate (note, this should only be one or two pieces. If you suffer from an eating disorder, you might find it easier if no food is included in your self-soothing kit). Touch A favorite rock or gem you can hold in your hand Bath salts, oils, or bubble bath to take a bath in (this would also cover smell). A small stuffed animal, or soft fabric A gel face pack, facial scrub, or lotion Stress ball, or squishy toy A soft/warm blanket or sweater Soft, fuzzy socks Heating Pad Nail Polish Small slinky toy, or other child’s toy that is fun to hold Smell A small scented candle (this can also cover sight). A stick of cinnamon or your favorite spice. Incense of your favorite smells Misc Items Journal for writingFavorite Recipes for cooking or bakingA pet’s toy – either to touch, or remind you to play with your pets if you have one you enjoy playing with. This could also be an extra leash to remind yourself to go on a walk with your dog.A coloring book (yes, adults can color too, and it’s fun!) with fun colored pens, markers, or crayons. Check out websites like Art Is Fun for free downloadable coloring pages for adults and teens.DIY craft project instructions or suppliesA gift card to your favorite coffee shopThe phone number of your best friend, to remind you to call themA love letter written to yourself. Get going! You’ll likely find that once you get going, you will get excited about making your self soothing kit. What kinds of things would you include in yours? Please post your experiences with, thoughts about, or even photos of your self soothing kit! 
 When Eating Disorder Treatment Fails Nourishing the Soul February 18, 2013 When family members first learn that their loved one has an eating disorder, most are quick to ask an obvious question: Whats the treatment? Which is usually followed by another obvious question: How long will it take? Given that were talking about conditions with intimidating, Greek-derived names like Anorexia, itd be easy to assume that medical and mental health professionals have this whole treatment thing figured out. Youd think that all that data would lead us to a well-established treatment protocolone administered consistently, reliably, invariably to patients around the world. Something like an antibiotic for the food-impaired psyche. Yet the reality is less constant and less comforting: Anorexia, Bulimia and Binge Eating Disorder are conceptualized and treated in various ways. In the story of eating disorder treatment, there is a loosely organized narrative, with many disparate threads. You can imagine the disappointment and frustration most people feel when they learn this stark fact. You may have felt that way, too. Though were learning more all the time, eating disorder research is still in its infancy. Heres what we know: Eating disorders most likely develop due to a multitude of factors which include genetics, ongoing biological processes, and environmental influences. They are not caused by moms poor body image or dads vegetarianism; they are not inevitable in the children of adults who meet diagnostic criteria. But there is evidence for heritability: People are more likely to develop an eating disorder when a first-degree relative has one. And we know that parental eating patterns, as well as attitudes about weight, impact childrenfor better or worse. Heres the good news: There are some treatments that seem to be relatively good at reducing eating disorder symptoms. But the most important word in that sentence is relatively. Relative to other treatments, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is fairly effective for Bulimia and Binge Eating Disorder. Relative to other treatments, Family-Based Therapy is fairly effective for adolescents with Anorexia. Sadly, this tells you very little about your loved one, and how he or she will respond to treatment. And thats the bad news. During treatment, some individuals very quickly gain insight about why their difficulties began. For example, many Anorexics will tell you that they actually didnt feel particularly fat before the eating disorder began to eat away at their lives; rather, they were experiencing something overwhelmingeither external circumstances or their own internal responsewhich seemed impossible to tolerate or control. The answer, they found, was to restrict their caloric intake; this, at least, seemed to grant them a sense of mastery over their bodies (and lives). But even an insight as profound as this does not guarantee weight restoration or recovery; for this, the individual actually needs to eat. The act of eating, however, is never as simple as piling food on a fork and directing it toward a waiting mouth, just as refraining from vomiting is never as simple as avoiding a toilet. These behaviors have meaning, and they become part of a set of behaviors around which the individual organizes her life. So why isnt treatment more successful at getting people to abandon these worn out patterns? Treatment can stall for a laundry-list of reasons which include: physiological factors (either associated with the eating disorder, or co-occurring and unrelated); psychological factors, including undiagnosed or untreated conditions; attitudes and beliefs about recovery; therapeutic factors that relate to the type of treatment being conducted, the setting in which it takes place, or to the therapist; and environmental factors, which include things like family influence and the media. But regardless of why your loved one may have plateaued in treatment (or even failed to leave the starting gate), you can take important steps like these to right her course and encourage recovery: Learn all you can about eating disorder treatment in order to determine whether your expectations are realistic.Share your concerns with the treatment team and ask how they think things are going.If necessary, get a second opinion; consult with another medical or mental health professional to get feedback about whether your loved ones experience is typical or cause for alarm.Think about whether environmental factors might be reinforcing the eating disorder. Some things to consider: Is your loved one participating in activitiessuch as ballet or gymnasticsin which a thin body is idealized? Is she benefiting from the eating disorder in any way, such as getting attention from parents or increased respect from peers?Talk with her directly to see whether or not she thinks shes making good progress; it could be that her decision to refrain from fat talk with friends represents a major accomplishment in her eyes, even if shes made little progress in changing her eating patterns. Educate yourself about which eating disorder symptoms are most dangerous, so that you can assess how shes doing, make informed decisions about her care, and accurately communicate your concerns with her treatment team. For example, poor body image is generally less worrisome than vomiting after meals. In some ways, eating disorder treatment can feel like the Wild Westvast, loosely mapped, and ruled by contending factions who each want to stake their claim. But even on stretches of unmarked trail, we generally know how to steer (willing) people toward health and wholeness. It is not enough. It is what we have. And with additional years of ongoing research, our cartography skills will only improve.

 Gratitude in Recovery: What I Learned from my Eating Disorder and What You Can Too by Kate Daigle November 21, 20112 I love this time of year because there is so much energy given to gratitude. Thanksgiving is a holiday that may bring trepidation and anxiety to folks recovering from eating disorders such as bulimia, anorexia, or binge eating disorder, but it is also a day where we are invited to sit down and be thankful for what we have. Theres not a day that goes by where I am not giving thanks for my recovery from my eating disorder. As I sit and hold space with my clients who are finding their own journey to recovery, I am regularly reminded of my own process and the steps that brought me to where I am today. The recovery process of an eating disorder is fraught with ups, downs, twists, and turns, and many frustrations and confusions about these peaks and valleys. Why cant I just stop these behaviors? some might wonder.or, Why am I not able to see myself the way that others do? I have had to answer these questions myself, and the passion I felt for my own health and healing ignited my career path to becoming a psychotherapist who helps others get here too. Sometimes my clients and I contemplate what they could learn from their eating disorder. What is its function? What are its needs? What is it trying to tell you? And even: What is it wanting to help you with? I know, thinking of an eating disorders as helpful might seem bizarre and unconventional. Eating disorders are painful, destructive, and demeaning, you might say. I agree  they are those things. But by looking at it in a new way, in one that invites gratitude and healing instead of illness and pain, we might find a more peaceful path towards the end goal: recovery. In the spirit of gratitude and thanks, I wanted to offer some insight into what I learned from my eating disorder (perhaps that I might not have learned in the same way if I hadnt ever had an eating disorder)  and what you can too. What My Eating Disorder Offered to Me and How My Recovery is Deeper Because of It I have feelings. Some muddy. Some sticky. Some smelly. And they are all ok! I remember that before I developed an eating disorder, I experienced many complex and somewhat foreign feelings (maybe part of being a pre-teen!) and I didnt know what to do with them. I pushed many of them  ones that felt unacceptable  inside and tried to forget about them. Oh how they grew and festered! This then caused me to feel overwhelmed and not know what to do with them. Disordered eating was one way of trying to manage. In my recovery, I have learned to find ways to sit with and sit through all of the feelings I experience and to understand that they are part of what it means to be a human being. I am grateful for all of my emotions, as they give me depth, character, and space to grow.I can eat!. When I embarked on recovery, one of my biggest fears was that I wouldnt be able to eat foods that I really loved and feel satisfied by them. I worried that my relationship with food would always be somewhat warped and abnormal. I am so grateful for the relationship I have with food and eating today. There is truly nothing that I tell myself that I cannot eat, and I check in with my body daily to ask it what it is wanting. When I am able to do that, I can eat until I am satisfied, enjoy my meal, and leave the table knowing I can have it again tomorrow if I wish. Freedom from destructive eating behaviors is so liberating and my whole view on food has shifted!I know myself pretty darn well. One of the requirements for recovery from an eating disorder is a willingness to explore, accept, and challenge yourself. Through my recovery journey, I have deepened my connection with my body, I have found acceptance with my emotions and feelings, and I have developed a peaceful perspective about who I am and what makes me unique. These are things that I believe I learned so deeply (because I had to) in my recovery and Im not sure that I would have explored myself so intricately if I hadnt developed an eating disorder. I am still always growing, learning, and changing, and will forever be on a quest of self-discovery  and I feel like my eating disorder allowed me to be open to that challenge.My body is mine. And its beautiful. I was walking down the street yesterday, noticing my steps, my pace, the way my feet felt in my shoes. I realized that I didnt want any other body. I spent so many years wishing I had a different body. But if I had a different body  blue eyes instead of brown, etc  then I wouldnt be me. I am the only person who could be me, and this body is a gift that I am given the responsibility to take care of. And it will give back to me a hundred-fold. And it does. These are a few thoughts that came up as I was contemplating gratitude today, Thanksgiving Eve. I learn new things every day that I am grateful for in my recovery as well as things that my eating disorder has taught me. I invite you to think about what you are grateful for today and every day and to foster some energy in that direction. If you have recovered from or are in recovery from an eating disorder, what are you taking from the process? What do you want to look back on in ten years and remember about this journey? Recovery is lifelong. Every day brings a new opportunity to utilize skills, tools, and learnings from our lifes path. And Im always growing and learning. 
 Dishonesty in treatment and recovery: working the stages of change in eating disorder recovery by Kate Daigle August 17, 2012 Recovery from an eating disorder is a complex and difficult process. I believe that it takes a combination of several factors to fully recover: honesty, accountability, compassion, and determination. Treating eating disorders is also challenging because treatment may require holding all of those factors all at once and finding a balance with them in the therapeutic process. Many people enter counseling because they want to create a new way of living their lives. They have a desire to change. The readiness to change, I think, it probably the single most determining factor in actually creating a change. There are several stages of readiness to change, and clients may show up in any of these stages. The stages of readiness to change are: 1. Precontemplation  at this stage, almost all of the desire to change is external to the client, meaning they might be forced to come to therapy, they might be ambivalent about it, they may change only if the external pressure is significant enough  but this type of change is typically short-lived if not internalized. People in the precontemplation stage might feel demoralized and dont want to think about their problem because they feel that the situation is hopeless. There is certain comfort in recognizing that demoralization is a natural feeling that accompanies this stage-and in realizing that if you take yourself systematically through all the stages of change, you can change. 2. Contemplation. People in this stage realize they might be stuck and desire for things to be different. People acknowledge that they have a problem and begin to think seriously about solving it. Contemplators struggle to understand their problem, see its causes, and begin to wonder about possible solutions. Often, people in this stage are not quite ready to risk taking action, and as a result can stay in this stage for a very long period of time. 3. Preparation. This is the stage where people begin to make changes  within the next few weeks or a month. This intention is made public, perhaps by involving loved ones or support systems. It is important to feel solid in this stage and to develop a foundational plan for how to follow-through with the change; moving too quickly through it might decrease the persons chances for success. 4. Action. This is a busy period where behavior is overtly changed and modified. These changes may be more visible to other people (for example quitting smoking or decreasing eating disorder behaviors), but some of the internal work of this stage and prior stages might not be as overtly visible. 5. Maintenance. This stage is where changes and steps taken up until this point are consolidated and continually reintroduced to the client. These might be solidifying new coping mechanisms and preventing relapses. This is the longest stage of change and requires commitment and active alertness. 6. Termination: The final goal! This is where prior issues or struggles are no longer present and recovery feels solid. In eating disorder recovery, this may mean that behaviors have been eliminated for a long period of time (years) but that alertness is still required to take care of oneself and prohibit a relapse. Change involves not only modifying behaviors but learning to cope with and manage emotions in a healthier way. Lying and dishonesty in treatment and recovery from an eating disorder can come up commonly in several stages of change. Those where the most committed action is involved  Preparation and Action stages  can create confusing and conflicting emotions. When the eating disorder is directly confronted and perhaps threatened, it can try to take back control in such a direct way that it may manipulate the client into being dishonest or lying to their therapist or support system. This is an attempt to remain safe, even though it may be maladaptive. Why is this? There are a few reasons why dishonesty creeps up in recovery. It may be that the client wants to be perfect at recovery, or to please their therapist or loved ones because external validation may feel like the primary form of inner comfort. If they are struggling, they may feel like they are disappointing those who are supporting them. It also may come up as the client begins to realize the enormous loss that is felt when an eating disorder is taken away. This change requires forming new relationships with the self and learning to cope in healthier, more fulfilling ways. If the client has used the eating disorder to cope with an inner hunger or emptiness, thinking that this needs to be let go can be terrifying. It is when the client has fed that inner hunger in a more loving way that the eating disorder loses its power. It is important for clinicians to recognize the signs of dishonesty in recovery. This is a great time to enact change in the eating disorder behavioral process and to show compassion for the struggle that the client is experiencing. Holding clients accountable and challenging them is a crucial part of the recovery process. Parents and loved ones can learn more about their role in this process in an article written for parents called Your Role. It is possible to fully recover from an eating disorder. Sometimes this might mean going through a few of the stages of change several times, or staying in one for a period of time before you are ready to move on. 
 From: Physical Dangers and Effects of an Eating Disorder somethingfishy.com There are many men and women suffering with all types of Eating Disorders that do not appear in any specific weight range. Those with Anorexia can be slightly overweight... while those with Compulsive Eating can be slightly underweight. Variations for all who suffer can be anywhere from extremely underweight to extremely overweight to anywhere in between. The outward appearance of anyone with an Eating Disorder does NOT dictate the amount of physical danger they are in, nor does is determine the emotional conflict they feel inside. They need not display even close to all of the below symptoms to be in danger. Behaviors Associated with Eating Disorders Starvation and restriction of food calories and/or fat grams sometimes accompanied by self-induced vomiting, laxatives, diuretics and obsessive exercise with any food intake, or without food intake at all. Binge and Purge episodes abnormally large intake of food followed by self-induced vomiting, intake of laxatives or diuretics, obsessive exercise and/or periods of starvation. Overeating Binge Episodes -abnormally large, uncontrollable intake of food. ALL Eating Disorders are Dangerous It is important to understand that even though a person may be suffering specifically with Anorexia, Bulimia or Compulsive Overeating, it is not uncommon for them to exhibit behaviors from each of the three. It is also not uncommon for one Eating Disorder to be swapped for another (Example: a person who is suffering with Anorexia switches to Bulimia; a persons suffering with Compulsive Overeating switches to Anorexia). This is why it is important to be aware of THE DANGERS BELOW, all of which are risks no matter what Eating Disorder you suffer with. DO NOT FALL INTO THE TRAP OF THINKING "I ONLY DO THIS A FEW TIMES A MONTH SO I CAN'T BE AT RISK" OR "I DON'T DO THIS ALL THE TIME, I JUST GO THROUGH HEALTHY AND NON-HEALTHY CYCLES" -- THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE NOT IN DANGER, NOR DOES IT MEAN YOU DO NOT SUFFER FROM AN EATING DISORDER. Dangers Associated with and Diseases Triggered or Caused by Eating Disorder Behaviors Malnutrition - caused by undereating or overeating. The word malnutrition indicates deficiency for energy, protein and micronutrients (e.g. vitamin A, iodine and iron) either singularly or in combination. It can cause severe health risks including (but not limited to) respiratory infections, kidney failure, blindness, heart attack and death. Links: NutriQuest -- Body of Evidence Malnutrition Defined Dehydration - caused by the depletion or lack of intake of fluids in the body, or by restriction of carbohydrates and fat. Restriction/Starvation, vomiting and laxative abuse are the primary causes in sufferers of Eating Disorders. Symptoms include dizziness, weakness, or darkening of urine. It can lead to kidney failure, heart failure, seizures, brain damage and death. Links: Dehydration Dehydration Defined Electrolyte Imbalances - electrolyte are essential to the production of the body's "natural electricity" that ensures healthy teeth, joints and bones, nerve and muscle impulses, kidneys and heart, blood sugar levels and the delivery of oxygen to the cells. Links: The Minerals That Make Up Electrolytes Hyponatremia (related to "water-loading") - as stated above, electrolytes are essential to proper body functioning. Drinking too much water (more than eight, eight-ounce glasses in less than twelve hours), can cause Hyponatremia (not enough sodium in the blood), especially in someone already malnourished or dehydrated. Hyponatremia can cause fluid in the lungs, the brain to swell, nausea, vomiting, confusion and even death. Refeeding Syndrome (related to treatment) - Starved or severely malnourished patients can undergo life-threatening fluid and electrolyte shifts following the initiation of aggressive nutritional support therapies. This phenomenon is known as "refeeding syndrome" and can occur in patients receiving either enteral (tube feeding) or parenteral (intravenous feeding) nutritional support. To avoid the development of the refeeding syndrome, nutrition support in patients at risk should be increased slowly while assuring adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals. Organ function, fluid balance and serum electrolytes (especially phosphorus, potassium and magnesium) need to be monitored daily during the first week and less often thereafter. Links: Refeeding Syndrome Monitoring Nutrition Therapy Vitamin and Mineral Deficiencies Lanugo - (soft downy hair on face, back and arms). This is caused due to a protective mechanism built-in to the body to help keep a person warm during periods of starvation and malnutrition, and the hormonal imbalances that result. Edema - swelling of the soft tissues as a result of excess water accumulation. It is most common in the legs and feet of Compulsive Overeaters and in the abdominal area of Anorexics and/or Bulimics (can be caused by Laxative and Diuretic use). Muscle Atrophy - wasting away of muscle and decrease in muscle mass due to the body feeding off of itself. Impaired Neuromuscular Function - due to vitamin and mineral deficiencies (specifically potassium), and malnutrition. Links: Muscle Atrophy Defined Paralysis - transient (or temporary) paralysis -- extreme weakness of muscles or not being able to move at all -- Caused by low levels of potassium, and/or the degeneration of nerve cells, in the spinal cord or in the brain, which have been deprived of essential nutrients. Left untreated, periods of paralysis may happen more frequently and more severely, lead to permanent muscle weakness, and even result in death. Tearing of Esophagus - caused by self-induced vomiting Mallory-Weiss tear - associate with vomiting, a tear of the gastroesophageal junction Gastric Rupture - spontaneous stomach erosion, perforation or rupture. Gastrointestinal Bleeding - bleeding into the digestive tract. Links: Gastrointestinal Bleeding Information Esophageal Reflux - Acid Reflux Disorders - partially digested items in the stomach, mixed with acid and enzymes, regurgitates back into the esophagus. This can lead to damage to the esophagus, larynx and lungs and increases the chances of developing cancer of the esophagus and voice box. Reflux can sometimes become severe enough that food cannot be kept down at all and medical attention should be sought immediately. Barrett's Esophagus - associated with Cancer of the esophagus and caused by Esophageal Reflux, this is a change in the cells within the esophagus. Links: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Barrett's esophagus Cancer - of the throat and voice box (Larynx) due to acid reflux disorders. Links: Cancer of the Larynx Insomnia - having problems falling and/or staying asleep. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome - continuous and crippling fatigue related to a weakened immune system. Links: The CFIDS Association Hyperactivity - manic bouts of not being able to sit still. Swelling - in face and cheeks (following self-induced vomiting). Callused or bruised fingers - this is caused by repeatedly using the fingers to induce vomiting. Dry Skin and Hair, Brittle Hair and Nails, Hair Loss - cause by Vitamin and Mineral deficiencies, malnutrition and dehydration. Low Blood Pressure, Hypotension (more common in those with Anorexia and/or Bulimia) - cause by lowered body temperature, malnutrition and dehydration. Can cause heart arrhythmias, shock or myocardial infarction. Links: Low Blood Pressure Orthostatic Hypotension - sudden drop in blood pressure upon sitting up or standing. Symptoms include dizziness, blurred vision, passing out, heart pounding and headaches. Links: Orthostatic Hypotension High Blood Pressure, Hypertension (more common in those with Compulsive Overeating and/or Binge Eating Disorder) - elevated blood pressure exceeding 140 over 90. Can cause: blood vessel changes in the back of the eye creating vision impairment; abnormal thickening of the heart muscle; kidney failure; and brain damage. Links: Hypertension Low Platelet Count or Thrombocytopenia - Caused by low levels of vitamin B12 and Folic Acid, and/or by excessive alcohol. It may also be an indication of a suppressed immune system or immune dysfunction. Links: Thrombocytopenia Disruptions in Blood Sugar Levels - Low Blood Sugar/Hypoglycemia: can indicate problems with the liver or kidneys and can lead to neurological and mental deterioration. Links: Reactive Hypoglycemia Homepage Elevated Blood Sugar/Hyperglycemia - can lead to diabetes, liver and kidney shut down, circulatory and immune system problems. Diabetes - high blood sugar as a result of low production of insulin. This can be caused by hormonal imbalances, hyperglycemia, or chronic pancreatitis. Links: Eating Disorders and Diabetes Ketoacidosis - high levels of acids that build up in the blood (known as ketones) caused by the body burning fat (instead of sugar and carbohydrates) to get energy. It can be a result of starvation, excessive purging, dehydration, hyperglycemia and/or alcohol abuse (it can also be a result of uncontrolled or untreated diabetes). It can lead to coma and death. Links: Diabetic ketoacidosis Alcohol Ketoacidosis *You do not need to be diabetic or alcoholic to end up with Ketoacidosis! Iron Deficiency, Anemia - this makes the oxygen transporting units within the blood useless and can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, increased infections, and heart palpitations. Links: Anemia Anemia Kidney Infection and Failure - your kidneys "clean" the poisons from your body, regulate acid concentration and maintain water balance. Vitamin Deficiencies, dehydration, infection and low blood pressure increase the risks of and associated with kidney infection thus making permanent kidney damage and kidney failure more likely. Osteoporosis - Thinning of the bones with reduction in bone mass due to depletion of calcium and bone protein, predisposing to fractures. Osteopenia - Below normal bone mass indicating a calcium and/or vitamin D deficiency and leading to Osteoporosis. * Hormone imbalance/deficiencies associated with the loss of the menstrual cycle can also increase your risks of Osteoporosis and Osteopenia. Arthritis (degenerative) - can be caused by hormonal imbalances and vitamin deficiencies as well as increased stress on the joints in individuals who suffering Compulsive Overeating. TMJ "Syndrome" and Related TMJ Problems - degenerative arthritis within the tempero-mandibular joint in the jaw (where the lower jaw hinges to the skull) creating pain in the joint area, headaches, and problems chewing and opening/closing the mouth. Vitamin deficiencies and teeth grinding (often related to stress) can both be causes. Links: Toothaches and TMJ Syndrome The TMJ Association Amenorrhea - Loss of Menstrual Cycle (due to lack of secreting hormone, Oestrogen, by the ovaries). Loss of the menstrual cycle can also lead to Osteopenia and Osteoporosis.

Dental Problems, Decalcification of teeth, erosion of tooth enamel, severe decay, Gum Disease - will be caused by stomach acids and enzymes (from vomiting); vitamin D and calcium deficiencies, and hormonal imbalance. Can also be due to the lack of exercise the teeth can get from the process of eating certain foods. Dental problems can sometime indicate problems with the heart. Links: Toothaches and TMJ Syndrome Dental Erosion Liver Failure - the liver aids in removing waste from cells, and aids in digestion. You cannot live without your Liver. Fasting and taking acetaminophen (drug found in over-the-counter pain killers) increases your risks for Liver damage and failure. Loss of menstruation and dehydration (putting women at risk for too much iron in their system), and chronic heart failure can lead to liver damage or failure. Bad Circulation, Slowed or Irregular Heartbeat, Arrhythmias, Angina, Heart Attack - There are many factors associated with having an Eating Disorder that can lead to heart problems or a heart attack. Sudden cardiac arrest can cause permanent damage to the heart, or instant death... electrolyte imbalances (especially potassium deficiency), dehydration, malnutrition, low blood pressure, extreme orthostatic hypotension, abnormally slow heart rate, electrolyte imbalances, and hormonal imbalances can all cause serious problems with the heart, high blood pressure, accumulation of fat deposits around the heart muscle, high cholesterol, decreased exercise due to lack of mobility, diabetes and hormonal imbalances can all lead to serious problems with the heart. Infertility - the inability to have children. Caused by loss of menstrual cycle, and hormonal imbalances. Malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies can also make it impossible to succeed with a full-term pregnancy, and can increase the chances significantly of a baby born with birth defects. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome - a study a few years ago suggested that people with Eating Disorders were at an increased risk for developing Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCO), and that recovery from the Eating Disorder should be part of treatment for PCO.

 Eating Disorders Hitting Women Over 50, Study Finds By Steven Reinberg, HealthDay June 21, 2012 Researcher says new treatment strategies needed to target this older population. Although eating disorders are typically thought of as a problem among teenage girls, many women over 50 practice unhealthy eating behaviors, a new study indicates. The researchers found that almost 4 percent report binge eating, nearly 8 percent report purging, more than 70 percent diet to lose weight and 62 percent say their weight or shape adversely impacts their lives, according to the report published June 21 in the International Journal of Eating Disorders. "Everyone -- especially health-care providers -- needs to erase stereotypes about who experiences disordered eating. Women well into their 50s and beyond still report struggling with weight dissatisfaction and a palette of unhealthy behaviors aimed at weight control," said lead researcher Cynthia Bulik, director of the University of North Carolina Eating Disorders Program. "Our '70 is the new 50' society may be placing additional appearance pressures on women that perpetuate disordered eating practices well into older adulthood," she added. These messages cause dissatisfaction and lead women toward extreme measures to achieve these "societally concocted ideals," Bulik said. For the study, Bulik's team collected data on more than 1,800 U.S. women who took part in the Gender and Body Image Study. Among these women, about 27 percent were obese, 29 percent were overweight, 42 percent were normal weight and 2 percent were underweight, the study authors noted. About 8 percent of women said they purged in the last five years and 3.5 percent said they had binged in the past month, the investigators found. Most of these women were in their early 50s, but there were also women over 75, the authors said. In addition, 36 percent of the women said they spent at least half their time in the last five years dieting, 41 percent said they checked their body size or shape daily and 40 percent weighed themselves at least twice a week. Moreover, 62 percent said their weight or shape had a negative impact on their life, 79 percent said it affected their image of themselves and 64 percent said they thought about it daily. Many women resorted to unhealthy ways to lose weight, including diet pills (7.5 percent), excessive exercise (7 percent), diuretics (2.5 percent), laxatives (2 percent) and vomiting (1 percent), the researchers found. In all, 66 percent didn't like their overall appearance. Their dissatisfaction was highest with their stomach (84 percent) and shape (73 percent). "We simply cannot ignore disordered eating and weight dissatisfaction in women over 50," Bulik said. "But, we have no idea how to tailor interventions for women over 50 so treatment can be appropriate to their developmental stage in life. That is a critical next step," she said. Eating disorders can have dire consequences, Bulik noted. "Anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness. Although we do not have clear data on differences in mortality across the age spectrum, we do know that the body becomes less resilient to the physical insults from starvation, binge eating and purging as it ages. So these disorders in older women may lead to even more medical complications because the body bounces back less easily as it ages," she said. Bulik said there are signs to look out for that may indicate someone has an eating disorder. These include: precipitous weight loss or low weight; withdrawing from family, partner and friends; evidence of binge eating or purging; extremely low self-esteem and body esteem; not eating with the family; avoiding events where there is food. "Partners can be so helpful, but often do not know what to do. Inform yourself about eating disorders and don't expect the problem just to go away. These are not just passing phases, these are serious and potentially life-threatening disorders that require treatment," she said. Commenting on the study, Dr. Edith Rubenstein, an attending psychiatrist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said: "This is an unrecognized problem. It had been thought the problem was much smaller." But, she added, "All of these weight and shape concerns are taking up a lot of mental space in women in this age group, surprisingly." There is a growing older population of women who are heavier, which may be contributing to this anxiety about weight and shape, Rubenstein said. These are serious problems that need attention, she explained. "If you have excessive concerns about weight and shape, if you are obsessing about weight and shape, if you are engaging in unhealthy behaviors like bingeing and purging, you should seek medical attention," Rubenstein advised.

 Eating Disorder Behavior Can Be a Form of Panic Attack by Joanna Poppink, MFT Retrieved February 2017 An OMG experience gives you more information about what's happening to you than the numbness an eating disorder provides. The Panic Attack Symptoms Nobody Talks About by Rachel Gearinger is a short, well written, candid article that may have powerful significance if you have or had an eating disorder. It's well known now that eating disorders can create a psychological numbness that dulls your senses and, for a short time, relieves stress. But you don't feel relief. You feel nothing. That dullness or numbness could be a form of depersonalization and/or derealization, a little discussed aspect of a panic attack. Please read the article and let me know what you think. joanna@poppink.com or below in the comments. If you think of your symptoms as a form of panic attack you could have a greater appreciation of your experience and what is triggering your behavior. You might think that ice cream or a buffet dinner or meeting new people are triggers for your eating disorder. But that doesn't give you more awareness of your situation. If you think those things trigger a panic attack in the form of eating disorder behaviors, you might start thinking of why or how these things would frighten you so much. When you start exploring the source of your fears you have the opportunity to build inner resources to cope with them. That process is an important aspect of eating disorder recovery psychotherapy and the road to your recovery. What occurs to you when you think of your eating disorder behaviors as panic attacks? 
 Releasing Anger in Eating Disorder Recovery by Z. Zoccolante, HealthyPlace February 1, 2017 At some point in your eating disorder recovery, you will need to release anger. Recovery is an interesting process and it can also be tough. When anger comes up, its important to know how to handle it so that it doesnt get stuck in your body and trigger eating disorder patterns (How to Channel Anger Constructively). Take a look at these helpful suggestions to help you release anger as it arises in your eating disorder recovery. Releasing Anger and Dealing with Depression in Eating Disorder Recovery When I was in the hospital for my eating disorder I remember a group leader telling us, Rage is anger turned outwards. Depression in anger turned inwards. It makes so much sense, especially for those of us whove been both anorexic and bulimic. Its like being a perfectionist for too long until were wound so tightly that we finally explode with rage in the form of external purging (How to Control Your Anger). Anger is a dangerous emotion because its the mask for sadness. When we take off the mask of our anger, usually we find that theres an ocean of sorrow beneath it. The reason we have masks in the first place is that we feel like they protect us. We often choose the anger because its the mask we think protects us from the sadness we dont want to feel. If you feel deeply angry then sadness is always brewing underneath (Sadness vs. Depression: Whats the Difference?). Why We Stay Angry Instead of Releasing Our Anger in Eating Disorder Recovery The reason we stay angry in eating disorder recovery is simple. We feel more powerful when were angry versus when were sad. When sadness overtakes us we can feel as though were floundering with our bellies exposed. Anger, on the other hand, gives us a sense of power and allows us to move with fire in our bellies. The problem with anger is that it holds a false sense of power. Often the angriest person in the room is also the saddest or the person who feels the most hurt and pain. Ways to Release Anger in Eating Disorder Recovery Do Five Wind Sprints I realize the irony of telling someone with an eating disorder to do a form of exercise, but if you are healthy enough and this will not trigger you, its a great one. Just a few sprints of 30-50 feet will help to clear some of that built-up aggression. 2) Throw Clay Against a Wall If you have a space to throw something safely, perhaps in your backyard or garage, hurling clay can be quite satisfying. If you can talk out loud, give a voice to whats going on internally before each throw. 3) Scream in Your Car This is one of my personal favorites. You can do this one with our without music playing over your stereo. You may want to sit in your driveway or park the car somewhere safe. Scream as loud as you can for as long as you can. Get that anger out. Usually, only a few screams will leave you feeling exhausted and energetically cleared out. You can also scream underwater in the ocean or your bathtub. The most important thing when youre releasing your anger in eating disorder recovery is to make sure that you are getting that anger moving out of your body. Feel it fully and then choose to let it go in whatever way feels best for you. Space is a vacuum and when we clear the anger we have more room for the good things like self-love, compassion, and greater strength for our recovery. 
 Eating Disorder Recovery Challenge: anesthesia or genuine human experience? by Joanna Poppink, MFT, Los Angeles eating disorder recovery psychotherapist June 14, 2016 If you want to start, improve or speed up your eating disorder recovery you may ask, "I know what I'm supposed to do and what I want to do. Why can't I do it?" This is a reasonable question. The answer is not because you are weak or not trying enough. Your solution is not about bearing down harder on the methods you are using, particularly will power and self criticism. Understanding what's really going on will help you get on and stay on your recovery path. When you set recovery goals for yourself without a real appreciation of the structural dynamics of your eating disorder you can set yourself up for frustration and what you consider to be failure. Your goals are based on wishful thinking about the strength of your will power. Your emotions have a powerful influence on whether your binge or starve. You may not be able to resist an urge to binge, You may be too terrified to eat at all. This is not weakness. This is finding yourself in a stressful situation that has gone too far. Whether your binge or starve you can believe that controlling, minimizing or eliminating your normal human emotions will free you from your eating disorder behaviors. Some people think or wish that success in giving up eating disorder behaviors is equal to becoming automatons with no feelings and a surface facade of agreeable charm. If this is you, your goal is to create yourself as an anesthetized presence with a pleasant smile and perfect body. Human feelings of fear, stress, pain, greed, rage, love, need, shame, vulnerability, separation and rushes of grandiosity or inferiority would then pose no difficulty. None of the emotional triggers for your eating disorder behaviors could exist in your anesthetized state. If you could make this condition your daily normal experience you believe you would not need your eating disorder and you would, at last, be free of your self-criticism and growing despair. However, this dream is a paradox, a tricky twist based on the actual structure of your eating disorder. Your eating disorder contributes to creating your anesthesia and functions to block you from your feelings. Your actual question is: "How can I be numb without using the eating disorder as an anesthetic?" In other words, you are asking for a substitute anesthetic. This is not only frustrating but dangerous since, in early recovery stages, people caught in looking for a substitute anesthetic, may experiment with substituting eating disorder behaviors with sex, drugs and alcohol behaviors. So what is the answer and how do you meet your recovery challenges? Before you can know and recognize your feelings, especially your trigger feelings, you need to be open to accepting yourself as a human being. You don't have to understand what that means right away. You just have to accept the fact that you are human and are about to learn what being human really means. Putting yourself, not only at the beginning of recovery, but at the beginning of understanding the nature of being human, gives you a solid place to stand in your learning and healing. You can relieve yourself of impossible expectation burdens you've been carrying about yourself and start at your realistic beginning. False assumptions can go. About Being Human Healthy humans feel the full range of what humans are capable of feeling. To be healthy and live a full life you need to be able to access your feelings, tolerate them and be able to think, make choices and function at the same time. Otherwise, the automaton is in charge. Choices that lead to painful or destructive consequences are made through oblivion since automatons don't feel anything and so don't consider painful results a consideration. If the automaton is you, trying to pass as an unfeeling creation, you will find yourself dealing with bewildering and painful situations. Your recovery work in your psychotherapy is about understanding and learning to live and function with feelings you can't yet bear. Sometimes, to avoid those feelings because they are uncomfortable or painful or set off an anxiety or a panic attack, you will seek a rush. You will put yourself in a high stress or high drama situation full of illogic, unpredictability and high risk. In such a situation you will be aware of powerful sensations that convince you that you are not numb and that you are feeling emotions. But the extreme sensations that flood your system are a device to block or numb your authentic human emotions. If you find yourself in highly dramatic, dangerous, exciting, frightening or exhilarating situations you may well be flooding yourself to avoid experiencing your unbearable emotions. You may be avoiding even the knowledge that those emotions exist. Eating disorder behavior may be an attempt to avoid feelings and risks, but the eating disorder thinking and behavior creates risk to life, health and happiness. The Only Option Living a satisfying life, free to pursue your deeply valued desires, requires a real presence in life. Becoming a nonhuman is not an option. The only option for healing and life is to become a more evolved human. When you reach the point in your recovery work that you acknowledge to yourself that personal evolution is your goal, recovery speed picks up. As you embrace your humanity you learn to recognize feelings and bear them in genuine life situations. When you can feel and think at the same time you can rally your courage to make choices that permit you to strive for your true heart's desire. As a clinician, I have learned that once my client's goal is to outgrow the limitations that make her eating disorder necessary, we can cooperate with the power of evolution. We can reach for a more solid and clear presence in her relationship not only with food but with a full range of people, experiences and surprises life presents to all of us. Once you are on this path, teachers, helpers, benefactors, and opportunities for right action, invisible to controlling perceptions, seem to synchronistically appear as you awaken to your true nature, speak your truth and honor yourself. This is not magic. This occurs because perception based on authentic feeling is more clear than perception based on an anesthetized condition. You are now attracted to and attract people and situations that are healthy and that encourage even more health in you. From this evolving place former eating disorder habits fall away. A more realistic and healthy life begins. At this point you appreciate your humanity, use all your feelings as information, make decisions based on thought and feeling, and live a more satisfying, and genuine life. The eating disorder is gone. You've evolved beyond it. 
 'It's not in the shadows any longer': New support for men with eating disorders Wallis Snowdon Jun 08, 2016 Trevor Schmidt began starving himself in his late 20s. He would go days without touching food, ignoring hunger pangs until they became unbearable. In a matter of weeks, he lost more than 20 pounds. "There is a sense of control that you have when you limit yourself from eating, or punish yourself from eating too much," he said. "At various points in my life, it was the only thing I felt I had control over." Schmidt is just one of the Edmonton men benefiting from a new support group by the Eating Disorder Support Network of Alberta (EDSNA). The session is intended to help men struggling with body-image issues, and reduce the stigma for men suffering from disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. "There is a lot of stigma and shame associated with any mental illness, and I think there is a common misconception out there that eating disorders only affect women," said Sue Huff, executive director of EDSNA. "So, when men are struggling with this, they experience double levels of shame and stigma, and it's difficult to admit that it's happening and reach out for help." Huff said eating disorders often manifest differently in men, making them harder to diagnose — leaving too many men to suffer in silence. The session is just a pilot, but Huff hopes to make it a permanent fixture at the clinic. "Men may punish themselves in different ways, but at the end of the day it's a very dysfunctional relationship with food, and that's the same whether male or female," Huff said during an interview on CBC Radio's Edmonton AM. "We're hoping to reach the men, we know they're out there." 'I was losing my identity' Though Schmidt's eating disorder didn't manifest itself until later, he thinks the seeds of his obsession began in early childhood. "My parents were extremely healthy, before that was a 'thing,' and my father was involved in bodybuilding. And I think that caused a bit of a disturbance in psyche about body image," Schmidt said. "I was also extremely small, and that became an identity for me. So as I got older, when my metabolism changed, and my body changed, it really struck a chord that I was losing my identity." When he started gaining weight in his mid 20s, it came as a shock. Aloof comments from old friends, suggesting he'd put on a few pounds, felt like daggers. "Of course, we've all put on weight over the last 25 years, but even now, it's like a knife in my big fat heart." But even as his obsession began to overtake his life, it would be months before Schmidt recognized the disease for what it was, and got professional help. "I don't like throwing up, so I just stopped eating," he said. "My weight kept creeping up because I was starving and bingeing. One day, my mom asked me if I was 200 pounds, and I stood on a scale and realized I was 180 pounds. I was horrified." Years after his diagnosis, he now maintains healthy weight and eating habits, but his obsession with food persists. He hopes by sharing his story, other men will decide to face their illness. "It's not in the shadows any longer. I hope people will be getting help for it." 
 Triggers in Eating Disorder Recovery by Z Zoccolante, Surviving ED, HealthyPlace April 6, 2016 There are many triggers in eating disorder recovery. Two common themes for those with eating disorders are a repulsion of fat and negative or distorted body image. Recovery includes adjusting our thoughts and feelings around these two, in spite of eating disorder triggers. It’s important to note, however, that no two people recover exactly the same way. Last week we talked about weight gain during recovery and viewing ourselves in the mirror (How to Deal with Weight Changes In Eating Disorder Recovery). One person told me that that they couldn’t look in the mirror because it made them want to cry. This made my heart hurt because it’s an honest, raw, and legitimate feeling. Many of us have experienced this feeling, myself included, and it’s a source of deep sorrow. So, how do we keep moving forward with triggers in eating disorder recovery? Acknowledge Your Feelings and Triggers in Eating Disorder Recovery First, it’s vital to acknowledge that our feelings and triggers are legitimate and valid (Mental Illness Validation: I Believe You). When we’ve committed to eating disorder recovery it doesn’t mean that we’re going to like it, especially at first. There will be times when we want to go back to our old patterns. There will be times when we miss our eating-disordered body, despite the fact that it was unhealthy or even destructive for us. We will miss our old life, even if it was killing us. I know we all know what I mean. It’s Okay to Be Scared of Eating Disorder Recovery Triggers Recovery is scary because it’s a whole new process. We’re giving up the control that we once so desperately sought and tried to keep a handle on. It’s okay to acknowledge that it sucks. It’s okay to be honest and say that we’re terrified of our body becoming a balloon, or of facing the emotional stuff we’ve been stuffing, starving, or throwing up (What The Mirror Shows Me in Eating Disorder Recovery). It’s Okay to Mourn the Loss of the Eating Disorder It’s okay to mourn the loss of the eating disorder; because, after all, it did serve a purpose. It was the best way that, at that point in time, we felt we could protect ourselves from the world. We’re not stupid. We just chose something that would provide us comfort, safety, control, or fill-in-the-blank we sought at our time of distress. Maybe we were grasping at straws and the eating disorder was the one that our fingers pulled. The eating disorder has been a close, intimate friend, and now we’re saying goodbye. It’s okay to mourn the loss of a friend, and to remember the reason we’re choosing to walk away. The relationship no longer serves us (Eating Disorder Recovery: Getting Better and Losing Friends). If we continue, it will destroy us mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. It will take us down, to the grave. It’s Okay to Handle Eating Disorder Triggers Your Way Although we share a common pool of eating disordered criteria, every person is unique. To the person who can’t look at their body in the mirror without crying, maybe mirrors trigger you or don’t feel like you have a safe space right now. That’s okay. Start your recovery where you feel comfortable and begin to expand that comfort zone (Body Image and Acceptance in Eating Disorder Recovery). Maybe for a while you can cover, or remove, all the full-length mirrors in your house. Maybe your recovery breakthrough will be more focused on how you feel in your body instead of coming to a contrived peace with what you see in the mirror. 
 A Simple Mantra for Eating Disorder Recovery by Z Zoccolante, Surviving ED, HealthyPlace March 9, 2016 Have you considered a simple mantra for eating disorder recovery? Eating disorder recovery can feel like a battle  because it is. We choose to go against the destructive voice that was once our friend. We choose to sit with uncomfortable feelings and emotions, and not reach for our easy coping tool. We choose to live in our bodies as they shift and change and as they learn to regulate and be without the disorder. Some days its tough, but we have to keep in mind what were fighting for. We have to keep in mind our end goal. Having an eating disorder recovery mantra can help (Mantras and Recovery: Mind Over Whats The Matter). An Eating Disorder Recovery Mantra for Freedom and Happiness My recovery was fought for freedom and happiness, the two things I wanted that kept eluding me during my disorder. I recovered a step at a time, sticking a toe into recovery and then retracting my commitment. Then, one day, when I finally knew too much, the seesaw tipped and had to recover. Id tried every angle, path, loop, and underground tunnel. The end result of every fractaled variation of the eating disordered behavior ended in sadness. This was when I knew I had to try something different. What I wanted wasnt found in whittling down my body fat, sticking my head over the toilet, watching all my food, or exercising till the eating disorder let me stop. All current roads led to sadness, but I wanted to be free. So I had to try recovery. During that time, I had a little mantra. I wrote it on my mirror and repeated it three times: Kindness Matters. Its a simple phrase, but its one we forget. Often, were warm, loving, and compassionate with others, but then forget to include ourselves in that bubble of kindness. This simple eating disorder recovery mantra is a powerful tool to help us through tough days, when were down about our bodies or feel blah about the whole process of getting, and staying, healthy. An Eating Disorder Recovery Mantra for Negative Body Days Every woman Ive talked with seems to shift from having happy days to suddenly being down on their bodies, which includes awful body image (The Physical Aspects of Anorexia Disorder Recovery), self-hate, cruel self-talk, and nitpicking at themselves. This shift has been triggered (Navigating Triggers During Eating Disorder Recovery), but a lot of people arent aware of that trigger so the shift seems to take place out of the blue. I recall a time I was backpacking through Europe for a month and eating ice cream every day. Then, when I got to my study abroad destination, I couldnt fit into one of my pairs of jeans. A meltdown ensued with me crying on the floor, telling myself horrible things about what a worthless failure Id become and vowing to lose weight immediately. An Eating Disorder Recovery Mantra for Encouragement What I needed most was kindness (5 Ways to Approach Triggering Emotions). I needed to be able to talk to myself as though I would encourage a friend. I needed to hear something like, Hey self, youre doing a great job. Youve been living. You havent been throwing up. Youve collected memories, smiles, and belly laughs. Youve eaten pear ice cream, walked down cobblestone streets, and had a cinnamon cone by the river. Youre much more than the circumference of your thighs. And yes, I know youre sad and its okay to cry. But were not going to be cruel to ourselves. Were going to treat ourselves as someone we love. This body is your home and you want to live in a happy home. If we can invite kindness back to the conversation, we can face recovery with confidence. Whatever happens, even if it feels like we take two steps forward and one step back, we can hold our own hand through the process. We can remind ourselves that were doing a great job. Kindness Matters. Kindness Matters. Kindness Matters. 
 How To Put Your Eating Disorder Recovery First by Jessica Hudgens, HealthyPlace.com Jan 15, 2015 First, lets recap why it is so important for you to put your recovery first. In short, your eating disorder affects every area of your life. Anorexia, bulimia, binge eating, and other eating disorders will destroy the things most important to you (and in short order!), so you need to spend just as much time and energy on your recovery as you did acting on your eating disorder. Which, while it surely felt second nature and automatic (and therefore probably felt like you spent no time at all on it), was a tremendous amount of time. My basic philosophy for prioritizing your eating disorder recovery can be summed up in three words: Recovery First. Always. The cornerstones of your recovery are nutrition (AKA eating without compensation) and appointments with your treatment team. These things should be scheduled before anything else on your calendar. This might leave you with some uncomfortable choices. For example: Early in my recovery, I was looking for a job and was finally offered the exact position I wanted in a preschool. However, the hours would have conflicted with the hours my therapist and dietitian were open. After talking with the school, there wasnt much they could do in the way of changing the hours, so I had to turn them (and the steady paycheck) down.I have, on more than one occasion, had dinner in my therapists office because of the timing of our sessions. It also really forced me to challenge the shame I felt about eating around other people.On the first day of classes last year, I had to approach my professors and tell them I would have to eat meals and snacks in class. Not only that, but if they found this disruptive, I would have to be excused to eat in the hallway. Not eating? Not an option. (Thankfully, all of my professors are great about it and actually encourage it!) What If I Cant Put My Recovery First? There have certainly been times in my life when it felt like I couldnt put recovery first. At some times it was because I didnt have the skills or support to make recovery happen; at others, it was because I didnt have the mental, emotional, or physical energy required to do so. Regardless of the reason, if you arent able to prioritize your recovery (and/or arent making good progress) in your current treatment situation, it may be time to change things. It may mean adding a second (or third) appointment each week with your therapist or seeing your psychiatrist every other week instead of every month. It may mean finding a treatment center near you where you can go a few nights a week for extra meal support and education. Or it may mean taking weeks or months away from home and doing a residential or inpatient stay to get your recovery going. I should note here that there is no shame in choosing any of these options if they are called for. A lot of us as sufferers, especially those of us who have been in recovery for some period of time, feel that increasing the time we are spending in treatment is a step backwards. Its not. Its a wise, recovery-oriented decision that ensures you keep your recovery first. Putting My Own Recovery First That said, I certainly understand the feeling of shame. I am struggling with it some myself now. I had to make the decision to drop a class prior to the start of the semester, knowing that the subject content could be triggering and that I am simply not equipped mentally or emotionally to take an extra class beyond the minimum required. While I am by no means back in my anorexia, I can certainly recognize areas where I have slipped and areas I need to prioritize to be at my prime physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. So for me, putting recovery first right now means a lighter workload. Even if that keeps me in school longer and it feels like a waste of money. Recovery first. Always. 
 Are more men getting eating disorders? by David Cox, The Guardian Sunday 18 January 2015 Somewhere deep within me is a destructive urge, says Colin. Its this gremlin in my head that hits me at unexpected moments. Ultimately, complete recovery requires changing my perception of myself. It is going to be a struggle, but its achievable. Colin is a 50-year-old community development manager, and has battled an eating disorder for more than two decades. Eating disorders have long been perceived as an issue affecting women and girls, but this idea has been shown to be increasingly warped: the number of men being diagnosed has risen by 27% since 2000. Typically, this has been interpreted as a stark reflection of increasing pressure on men to care more about their image, but the truth is perhaps more complex. Are cases of male eating disorders really increasing or are we simply getting better at recognising them? Statistics tell us that anorexia, for example, is 10 times more common in women than men, but we are preconditioned not to expect it in the latter. Then there is emotional overeating  far more common than either anorexia or bulimia  but which has only recently become the subject of serious research. One of our concerns is that diagnostic criteria for eating disorders are entirely based on female traits, explains Nadia Micali, a senior lecturer at the Behavioural and Brain Sciences Unit at University College London. To get an anorexia diagnosis, you need to be afraid of getting fat. But masculine concerns can include wanting a lean or defined physique, and males who become fixated with achieving that by excessive use of supplements, hormones or starvation may be dismissed by doctors. A number of men with eating disorders report reactions ranging from mild disbelief to outward aggression when they seek help. Many are branded as attention seekers, which only hastens a rapid decline in mental health. One of the reasons I relapsed was because I still have a continual fear of being a fraud, says Dave, a 25-year-old standup comedian, recovering from anorexia. When I first went to a GP with heart palpitations and low body temperature, I was told to buy a good jumper and cut down on coffee, and was shown the door. I now have a great doctor, who is understanding, but that constant fear that it was me and that I wasnt anorexic at all, made me try more and more dangerous ways of controlling what I ate and losing weight. The prevailing stereotype paints a picture of anorexia as largely a 21st-century phenomenon, a disease predominantly affecting white, teenage girls from comfortable, middle-class family backgrounds, with the western luxury of being able to control what they eat. We are led to believe it arises entirely due to the pressures of modern-day image ideals, and our persistent obsession in equating slim with beautiful. The reality is that anorexia is a mental disorder that has existed for centuries. It is neither gender nor geographically specific, and while it is most common in those aged 15-30, it can occur in older age groups too. And our perception of it as a female disease is, in fact, surprisingly recent. The first recorded case of anorexia was in 1649 when Richard Morton, a London physician, noted the symptoms of a young man. Morton described it as a nervous consumption and continued to record cases throughout his life. His notes refer to a wasting of the body without any remarkable fever, cough or shortness of breath and speculate on a link to the cares and passions of the mind. Anorexics themselves often reject the concept that their disorder has been triggered by the predominance of certain body types in magazines and adverts. Instead, it is a gradual process, where they slip into an addictive mindset of associating weight loss with both internal and external approval. This acts as a coping mechanism for some underlying trauma, which may range from the end of a relationship, bullying, loneliness, bereavement or general low self-esteem. The sensationalisation of eating disorders and, in the case of anorexia, creating the idea that you arent ill unless you are visibly emaciated adds to the problem. Anorexics dont necessarily have to look skinny, in the same way that you dont have to be in bandages to be genuinely ill, says Dave. Eating disorders may spring from a combination of nature and nurture, but it is thought that certain personality characteristics predispose people to them. Given that just 30-40% of those with eating disorders receive treatment, there is a growing drive across the US and the UK to collect blood samples and pinpoint genes that may indicate vulnerability. Part of the anorexic mindset is the competitive mindset, says Richard, a 24-year-old accounts manager. Its like a game and when I feel Im winning at it, controlling my hunger and overcoming the feeling of needing sustenance can become an almost spiritual experience. In my own mind, there is no drug or sensation like it. But its a game I can never win.  We should look at anorexia in the same way that we do bronchitis or sports injuries, Dave says. During my worst phases, I just wished I could have read something down to earth on the subject, something that said: There is nothing to be ashamed of. This is what it is, these are the risks and if you are worried, here is a helpline and how to get treatment. Men Get Eating Disorders Too is a national (UK) charity that supports men with eating disorders and their families. 
 New Eating Disorder Guidelines Released Medscape Medical News December 05, 2014 The first eating disorder guidelines to incorporate the latest recommendations from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), including the new disorder of avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), have been released. Produced by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, the guidelines are evidence-based, multidisciplinary, and include consideration of recovery-oriented practice, with a special focus on anorexia nervosa (AN). "One thing that is new and quite distinctive about these guidelines is that we have approached anorexia nervosa from the perspective of child and adolescent anorexia nervosa, anorexia nervosa in adults, and also severe and enduring anorexia nervosa, because the treatment approaches and the outcomes differ by clinically important ways," lead author Phillipa Hay, MD, told Medscape Medical News. "People realize that...there are really quite important differences both in terms of approaches in child or adolescent and adults and also the small proportion who go on to have severe and enduring illness," she added. Another major change has been the expansion of the guidelines to include bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder, as well other related disorders. "The other thing, of course, was the DSM-5 and the way eating disorders are conceptualized and the broadening of the diagnostic criteria. Thats an important aspect that's needed to be reflected in the guidelines and updated for clinicians." The guidelines are published in the November issue of the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry. Anorexia Management According to the guidelines, the management of AN should depend on the severity of the disorder and the age of the patient. These latest recommendations update previous guidelines published in 2009, which were developed specifically for AN. Expanding the reach of the current guidelines to include other eating disorders, Dr Hay, who is foundation chair of mental health, School of Medicine and Centre for Health Research, University of Western Sydney, Australia, and colleagues conducted a systematic review of the literature, identifying 21 articles for inclusion. A multidisciplinary working group then wrote draft clinical practice guidelines, which underwent community, expert, and stakeholder consultation, allowing the identification of additional evidence for best practice. Emphasizing the need for a wide-ranging approach to the management of patients with eating disorders, the authors note that there are several principles guiding treatment. These are as follows: Person-centered informed decision-makingThe involvement of family and significant othersRecovery-oriented practice, maximizing self-determination and self-managementLeast restrictive treatment, best suited to an individual's needsA multidisciplinary approachStepped and seamless care, building on strong links with primary care as well as general hospital and community care providersA culturally informed approach to diagnosis and treatmentIndigenous care, demonstrating "cultural competence" when working with people from different backgrounds New Disorder The guidelines also incorporate ARFID, a new disorder in the DSM-5. Although there is not a great deal of literature on ARFID, Dr Hay and colleagues felt that it was important to include it in the new guidelines. "We needed to have it there so that clinicians are aware of it as a disorder ― what it is and how to conceptualize it ― so that they can start seeing, identifying it, and start learning about its epidemiology and treatment," said Dr Hay. Finally, Dr Hay touched on the principle of least restrictive care, which is another notable change to the guidelines since their previous iteration. "Currently, the model for practice in Australia and New Zealand psychiatry is to treat people with the least intrusive and least restrictive environment," she explained. "We are really moving to try to do that as much as possible with anorexia nervosa, supporting people in the community with intensive outpatients or day patients treatment approaches, and reserving hospital only for those who are medically compromised and will sometimes need more intensive care." Looking more broadly at the growing body of literature on AN, Dr Hay believes that patient outcomes can be good. "Particularly in child and adolescent anorexia nervosa, we can be really quite optimistic and quite positive about treatment outcomes and about the efficacy of treatment," she said. "We have some good evidence-based treatments, particularly in child and adolescence anorexia nervosa, particularly with family-based approaches.... We do know that treatments work and that specialist treatments work." "We don't quite have that to the same degree in adult anorexia nervosa, but we do know that individual psychological therapies provided by specialists with specialist expertise are effective, and are certainly better than doing nothing or doing very little," she added. Need for More Research As well as clinical practice recommendations, the new guidelines stress the importance of further research into eating disorders, particularly for ARFID. Nevertheless, Dr Hay is hopeful that a number of randomized controlled trials that are currently under way, many of which are comparing psychological therapies, will prove enlightening. "I suspect over the next few years, we'll start to work out that specialist supportive clinical management is a very good initial psychological therapy and maybe sufficient for many people with anorexia nervosa, but not for all." "Some will require perhaps more intensive therapies, such as with cognitive-behavior therapy or with Maudsley adult therapy or focal psychodynamic therapy," she added. Further down the line, Dr Hay is working with Steven Childs at the University of Sydney on the concept of staging AN. Noting that the DSM-5 does not specify a clear upper weight cutoff for the disorder, Dr. Hay said: "People who may be not so very underweight, with body mass indices closer to the normal range, around 18, for example, would have quite different treatment needs and treatment approaches than people who have a body mass index right down at the level of about 13." "I think we are realizing that anorexia nervosa does have these different stages, these different clinical syndromes...and that has an impact upon treatment needs [in terms of] what you do and how quickly you may act, or not." The authors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. Aust N Z J Psychiatry. 2014;48:977-1008. Full text 
 Coping at Christmas: The Men With Eating Disorders Suffering in Silence Sam Thomas Founder and Director of Men Get Eating Disorders Too 07/12/2014 Christmas can be a difficult time for those who are suffering from an eating disorder, particularly for the men who are suffering in silence. This year, Men Get Eating Disorders Too (MGEDT), is reaching out to sufferers so they can be less isolated this festive season. As a former sufferer of bulimia, I know first-hand how the focus of food can play havoc on the mental wellbeing of those suffering at this time of year. From roast turkey, tins of sweets and mince pies - the temptation for excess of food is irresistible for many. However, for those suffering with anorexia and bulimia, the constant reminders of food can feel like never ending pain and torture. The time to be joyful is anything but that. There was a time when I used to dread Christmas- months ahead of the big day. Talking to our service users I'd realised it was a common anxiety. Keith, a binge eater, told me: "I think this is something that has been going on since my childhood when often the Christmas week meant that shops were closed and you couldn't get to a shop to buy food for the whole week. That meant that people would stock up in preparation for a few days of 'feasting' before they could go and get the staples in when the supermarkets reopened. Of course now there is only a small amount of time that the shops close so there is no need to do the bulk buys like the past." It's important to remember Christmas only lasts a couple of days and will pass by quickly. Despite feeling like a life sentence, living with an eating disorder need not be. By recognising you have a problem and speaking with others will help in those first steps towards support and recovery. For those concerned about a loved one Christmas is a daunting time for someone with an eating disorder, and what the person needs is compassion and understanding from those around them. Breaking with tradition can be worthwhile if it allows the person freedom around food and eating - what matters is that the person feels they can cope, not that they eat 'normally' Discussing some more with a friend of mine in the USA, a young rep for the National Eating Disorders Association and MGEDT Ambassador, he reassured me and other sufferers this festive season. Troy Roness said: "While I was in the depths of my illness, the holidays were especially difficult. My every thought, action, and moment were held captive to my eating disorder. I dolled-out hollow smiles and fake laughs to further the facade that I was 'fine.' However, my mind was never more than two seconds away from what I would or would not eat, where my access to the gym would come from, and how I would 'take care' of my indulgences during the holiday season. "Little did I know, though, that my thoughts about family, friends, and enjoying myself were not indulgences at all - they were human and very, very normal. My eating disorder forced me to believe that I was a horrible person for wanting to enjoy life, especially at a time when family and friends provide the most support. An eating disorder, no matter what time of the year, is nothing short of self-punishment. But during the holidays, they can be especially difficult. Seek out your support systems, talk about how you are feeling, and utilize the tools you feel comfortable with to enjoy the time you need and deserve." As so much of the holiday season is celebrated with food and meals, it can be a particularly stressful time for someone suffering from an eating disorder. Traditional practices can provoke an extraordinary amount of anxiety and make a vulnerable person much more prone to crisis. This is a time of year when sufferers need extra understanding, compassion, and support. If you are worried about yourself this festive season, here are some tips on how to cope: - Try to keep some perspective - worse things have happened. - Know that it is not forever - even this will fade into memory. - Know that you are not entirely responsible for yourself - no-one is an island. - Remember that no-one is watching or judging you - in all likelihood they've got their own worries. - Try to stay calm - this isn't worth getting upset over. - It will get easier with time. - You will come out the other side stronger. Regardless whether you are home with family or alone at home this Christmas, you can reach out for help, during the Christmas period. You are not alone and nor should you feel that you are. For more information and support this Christmas please visit Men Get Eating Disorders Too | Supporting men with eating disorders, carers and their families to get their voices heard Live chat one-to-one sessions will take place on Wednesday evenings, 7-8.30pm, and extra sessions over the festive period. Please consider donating to the MGEDT Christmas Appeal via Just Giving. For every pound it will help one more person seek the support they need.

 I am anemic. I also struggle with eating disorders so that makes it hard to treat the anemia, but I am taking the vitamin supplements the doctor recommended. I know this is probably pica. I have struggled with ice cravings in the past. I just want to eat chalk really badly. It's gross and weird and disturbing. I'm not sure why I'm even posting this because there aren't really any answers for it. Ugh. Just venting I guess. 
 The Role of Self-Acceptance in Recovering From Eating Disorders By Deborah Klinger, MA, at GoodTherapy.org March 18, 2010 People who struggle with eating and food issues often also struggle with poor self-esteem. I say poor rather than low because I believe the concept of high and low self-esteem to be problematic. If low self-esteem means perceiving ones self to be inferior to others, it follows that high self-esteem means perceiving ones self to be superior to others. Healthy self-esteem is neither high nor low. It is defined by the lack of concern about ones worth, coupled with a sense of competence and a belief in ones innate value. When a person is comfortable in their own skin, without worrying about whether they are good enough, being neither better nor worse than anyone else, thats good, solid, healthy self-esteem. Years ago, I worked for a foster care agency, where I taught classes to prospective foster parents. Our agency used an excellent curriculum called Model Approaches to Partnerships in Parenting (MAPP). MAPP was designed to help prospective foster parents understand the experience of children coming to live in their home. One of the MAPP modules was on self-esteem. It explained that, in order for a child to develop a sense of healthy self-esteem, they have to be taught, by virtue of the way they are treated by parents and caregivers, that they are four things: loveable, capable, responsible, and worthwhile. Its not just about what children are told, its also about how they are treated, and what kinds of responsibilities they are given, and when. Getting three out of these four isnt enough. Its like a dining room table: all four legs are needed for it to work as designed. When parents arent able, whether because of their own experiences, or by circumstances that interfere with their ability to parent well, to convey to their kids that they are these four things, children look outside themselves for indicators that they are good enough. They compare themselves to others using the criteria available: the grades they make, athletic abilities, physical appearance, popularity. When eating problems develop, comparing ones self to others intensifies. The act of comparing functions as an attempt to decrease feelings of insecurity and anxiety. The person who struggles with eating and food issues usually compares his/her body size and shape to others. A smaller body means relief and reassurance; and a bigger body means anxiety and shame. A person with an eating disorder judges him/herself harshly, to keep him or herself in line with food and exercise. This judgment erodes self-esteem even further, and perpetuates an unhealthy relationship with food and body. The antidote is self-acceptance. This is bedrock. It means zero self-judgment, no self-criticism, no comparing to others, no using external criteria as indicators of worth or value. It means affirming that, No matter what I do, think, feel, say, or look like, I deeply and completely accept myself. Its not about whether one is acceptable in the eyes of others. The active practice of accepting ones self is healing. Acceptance doesnt mean liking or approving of something. It means not fighting reality. Not fighting the body one is living in today, or flagellating ones self for eating or exercise behaviors, but simply acknowledging, without any judgment, what is. It is axiomatic that nothing can change unless and until it is first accepted. The idea of self-acceptance often raises concerns: If I accept myself as I am, its condoning unhealthy behaviors. If I accept myself, Ill never be motivated to change. I cant accept my [body/behavior] because I find it repulsive. I have to improve it before I can accept it. Ive often said that Ive never seen anyone whip or beat themselves into making positive changes. Practicing non-judgment of ones self creates a safe space, an arena in which there is no pressure to better ones self, but, instead, have an opportunity to heal. 
 and they treat you very badly because of it. It is not a moral failure. It is a mental illness and not something someone chooses. Who would want to end up with an eating disorder that slowly or quickly destroys your life if you don't get treatment for it? Not me. I sure did not mean to end up the way I have. I need help with this. I can't overcome it myself. It's not about willpower. It's about deep inner pain and control and hatred of self. That is what I need to overcome and I need help doing that. I hope this makes sense. 
 Self-Soothing Kits – Preparing for bad days by Nikki Paulie March 26, 2013 One of my favorite things to suggest to client, especially for dealing with bad days are Self-Soothing Kits. These are good when you’re feeling down and need a pick me up, when you have an urge to binge or purge with eating disorders, or have urges to self-harm. When we are feeling down, or low, that is not the time we tend to think to ourselves, “you know what would really make me feel better? Painting my nails, or calling a friend.” When we’re feeling low, we either want to just curl up in bed and ignore the world, or we want something that is instant and gratifying. We tend to turn to what we know, or use most often. If we’re suffering from mental health problems at the moment, usually that quick choice is not a healthy one. So, for those bad days, I bring you “How to build your own Self-Soothing Kit.” These can also be made as “safety kits” for people who are trying to avoid self-harming, sobriety kits for people who are trying to avoid giving into urges to drink or use drugs. Important tips to keep in mind There are a few things to keep in mind when building your self-soothing kit. It should be placed somewhere that you have easy access to, and should be stored in something portable, whether it’s a shoe box or a basket. Your self-soothing kit should also include things that allow you to use all 5 senses: sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell. Also, this is a kit to be made especially for you, so it should only include things that will make you feel better. Allows this to be a time for you to be creative, and really get in touch with yourself. Think about the things you really enjoy. Once your kit is made, you can always add to it later, or change it with time. You might find that there are some things that make you feel better in sometimes, and as you get older you start preferring other things, and that’s okay! Creation Here are some examples of some things you could include in your kit. These are just some ideas to get your creation going. Sight A rock, or gem that you enjoy looking at Decorated stationary for writing letters to friends, loved ones, or even yourself. This could also be a decorated journal. Photos of your close friends or family members, photos of fond memories or happy moments. InspirationalQuotes, see my Happy Thoughts tab for inspiration, feel free to print any of the quotes off for your kit. Your favorite book Pictures of funny cat or dog memes from the internet, or a written link to that YouTube video you can’t stop laughing at when you watch it. A fun magazine Comic strips Hearing A Meditation Recording. Check out UCLA’s Mindful Aware Research Center for some free guided meditations.Songs that make you feel happy or relaxed. Taste A variety of herbal teas A small piece of your favorite candy or chocolate (note, this should only be one or two pieces. If you suffer from an eating disorder, you might find it easier if no food is included in your self-soothing kit). Touch A favorite rock or gem you can hold in your hand Bath salts, oils, or bubble bath to take a bath in (this would also cover smell). A small stuffed animal, or soft fabric A gel face pack, facial scrub, or lotion Stress ball, or squishy toy A soft/warm blanket or sweater Soft, fuzzy socks Heating Pad Nail Polish Small slinky toy, or other child’s toy that is fun to hold Smell A small scented candle (this can also cover sight). A stick of cinnamon or your favorite spice. Incense of your favorite smells Misc Items Journal for writingFavorite Recipes for cooking or bakingA pet’s toy – either to touch, or remind you to play with your pets if you have one you enjoy playing with. This could also be an extra leash to remind yourself to go on a walk with your dog.A coloring book (yes, adults can color too, and it’s fun!) with fun colored pens, markers, or crayons. Check out websites like Art Is Fun for free downloadable coloring pages for adults and teens.DIY craft project instructions or suppliesA gift card to your favorite coffee shopThe phone number of your best friend, to remind you to call themA love letter written to yourself. Get going! You’ll likely find that once you get going, you will get excited about making your self soothing kit. What kinds of things would you include in yours? Please post your experiences with, thoughts about, or even photos of your self soothing kit! 
 When Eating Disorder Treatment Fails Nourishing the Soul February 18, 2013 When family members first learn that their loved one has an eating disorder, most are quick to ask an obvious question: Whats the treatment? Which is usually followed by another obvious question: How long will it take? Given that were talking about conditions with intimidating, Greek-derived names like Anorexia, itd be easy to assume that medical and mental health professionals have this whole treatment thing figured out. Youd think that all that data would lead us to a well-established treatment protocolone administered consistently, reliably, invariably to patients around the world. Something like an antibiotic for the food-impaired psyche. Yet the reality is less constant and less comforting: Anorexia, Bulimia and Binge Eating Disorder are conceptualized and treated in various ways. In the story of eating disorder treatment, there is a loosely organized narrative, with many disparate threads. You can imagine the disappointment and frustration most people feel when they learn this stark fact. You may have felt that way, too. Though were learning more all the time, eating disorder research is still in its infancy. Heres what we know: Eating disorders most likely develop due to a multitude of factors which include genetics, ongoing biological processes, and environmental influences. They are not caused by moms poor body image or dads vegetarianism; they are not inevitable in the children of adults who meet diagnostic criteria. But there is evidence for heritability: People are more likely to develop an eating disorder when a first-degree relative has one. And we know that parental eating patterns, as well as attitudes about weight, impact childrenfor better or worse. Heres the good news: There are some treatments that seem to be relatively good at reducing eating disorder symptoms. But the most important word in that sentence is relatively. Relative to other treatments, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is fairly effective for Bulimia and Binge Eating Disorder. Relative to other treatments, Family-Based Therapy is fairly effective for adolescents with Anorexia. Sadly, this tells you very little about your loved one, and how he or she will respond to treatment. And thats the bad news. During treatment, some individuals very quickly gain insight about why their difficulties began. For example, many Anorexics will tell you that they actually didnt feel particularly fat before the eating disorder began to eat away at their lives; rather, they were experiencing something overwhelmingeither external circumstances or their own internal responsewhich seemed impossible to tolerate or control. The answer, they found, was to restrict their caloric intake; this, at least, seemed to grant them a sense of mastery over their bodies (and lives). But even an insight as profound as this does not guarantee weight restoration or recovery; for this, the individual actually needs to eat. The act of eating, however, is never as simple as piling food on a fork and directing it toward a waiting mouth, just as refraining from vomiting is never as simple as avoiding a toilet. These behaviors have meaning, and they become part of a set of behaviors around which the individual organizes her life. So why isnt treatment more successful at getting people to abandon these worn out patterns? Treatment can stall for a laundry-list of reasons which include: physiological factors (either associated with the eating disorder, or co-occurring and unrelated); psychological factors, including undiagnosed or untreated conditions; attitudes and beliefs about recovery; therapeutic factors that relate to the type of treatment being conducted, the setting in which it takes place, or to the therapist; and environmental factors, which include things like family influence and the media. But regardless of why your loved one may have plateaued in treatment (or even failed to leave the starting gate), you can take important steps like these to right her course and encourage recovery: Learn all you can about eating disorder treatment in order to determine whether your expectations are realistic.Share your concerns with the treatment team and ask how they think things are going.If necessary, get a second opinion; consult with another medical or mental health professional to get feedback about whether your loved ones experience is typical or cause for alarm.Think about whether environmental factors might be reinforcing the eating disorder. Some things to consider: Is your loved one participating in activitiessuch as ballet or gymnasticsin which a thin body is idealized? Is she benefiting from the eating disorder in any way, such as getting attention from parents or increased respect from peers?Talk with her directly to see whether or not she thinks shes making good progress; it could be that her decision to refrain from fat talk with friends represents a major accomplishment in her eyes, even if shes made little progress in changing her eating patterns. Educate yourself about which eating disorder symptoms are most dangerous, so that you can assess how shes doing, make informed decisions about her care, and accurately communicate your concerns with her treatment team. For example, poor body image is generally less worrisome than vomiting after meals. In some ways, eating disorder treatment can feel like the Wild Westvast, loosely mapped, and ruled by contending factions who each want to stake their claim. But even on stretches of unmarked trail, we generally know how to steer (willing) people toward health and wholeness. It is not enough. It is what we have. And with additional years of ongoing research, our cartography skills will only improve.

 Gratitude in Recovery: What I Learned from my Eating Disorder and What You Can Too by Kate Daigle November 21, 20112 I love this time of year because there is so much energy given to gratitude. Thanksgiving is a holiday that may bring trepidation and anxiety to folks recovering from eating disorders such as bulimia, anorexia, or binge eating disorder, but it is also a day where we are invited to sit down and be thankful for what we have. Theres not a day that goes by where I am not giving thanks for my recovery from my eating disorder. As I sit and hold space with my clients who are finding their own journey to recovery, I am regularly reminded of my own process and the steps that brought me to where I am today. The recovery process of an eating disorder is fraught with ups, downs, twists, and turns, and many frustrations and confusions about these peaks and valleys. Why cant I just stop these behaviors? some might wonder.or, Why am I not able to see myself the way that others do? I have had to answer these questions myself, and the passion I felt for my own health and healing ignited my career path to becoming a psychotherapist who helps others get here too. Sometimes my clients and I contemplate what they could learn from their eating disorder. What is its function? What are its needs? What is it trying to tell you? And even: What is it wanting to help you with? I know, thinking of an eating disorders as helpful might seem bizarre and unconventional. Eating disorders are painful, destructive, and demeaning, you might say. I agree  they are those things. But by looking at it in a new way, in one that invites gratitude and healing instead of illness and pain, we might find a more peaceful path towards the end goal: recovery. In the spirit of gratitude and thanks, I wanted to offer some insight into what I learned from my eating disorder (perhaps that I might not have learned in the same way if I hadnt ever had an eating disorder)  and what you can too. What My Eating Disorder Offered to Me and How My Recovery is Deeper Because of It I have feelings. Some muddy. Some sticky. Some smelly. And they are all ok! I remember that before I developed an eating disorder, I experienced many complex and somewhat foreign feelings (maybe part of being a pre-teen!) and I didnt know what to do with them. I pushed many of them  ones that felt unacceptable  inside and tried to forget about them. Oh how they grew and festered! This then caused me to feel overwhelmed and not know what to do with them. Disordered eating was one way of trying to manage. In my recovery, I have learned to find ways to sit with and sit through all of the feelings I experience and to understand that they are part of what it means to be a human being. I am grateful for all of my emotions, as they give me depth, character, and space to grow.I can eat!. When I embarked on recovery, one of my biggest fears was that I wouldnt be able to eat foods that I really loved and feel satisfied by them. I worried that my relationship with food would always be somewhat warped and abnormal. I am so grateful for the relationship I have with food and eating today. There is truly nothing that I tell myself that I cannot eat, and I check in with my body daily to ask it what it is wanting. When I am able to do that, I can eat until I am satisfied, enjoy my meal, and leave the table knowing I can have it again tomorrow if I wish. Freedom from destructive eating behaviors is so liberating and my whole view on food has shifted!I know myself pretty darn well. One of the requirements for recovery from an eating disorder is a willingness to explore, accept, and challenge yourself. Through my recovery journey, I have deepened my connection with my body, I have found acceptance with my emotions and feelings, and I have developed a peaceful perspective about who I am and what makes me unique. These are things that I believe I learned so deeply (because I had to) in my recovery and Im not sure that I would have explored myself so intricately if I hadnt developed an eating disorder. I am still always growing, learning, and changing, and will forever be on a quest of self-discovery  and I feel like my eating disorder allowed me to be open to that challenge.My body is mine. And its beautiful. I was walking down the street yesterday, noticing my steps, my pace, the way my feet felt in my shoes. I realized that I didnt want any other body. I spent so many years wishing I had a different body. But if I had a different body  blue eyes instead of brown, etc  then I wouldnt be me. I am the only person who could be me, and this body is a gift that I am given the responsibility to take care of. And it will give back to me a hundred-fold. And it does. These are a few thoughts that came up as I was contemplating gratitude today, Thanksgiving Eve. I learn new things every day that I am grateful for in my recovery as well as things that my eating disorder has taught me. I invite you to think about what you are grateful for today and every day and to foster some energy in that direction. If you have recovered from or are in recovery from an eating disorder, what are you taking from the process? What do you want to look back on in ten years and remember about this journey? Recovery is lifelong. Every day brings a new opportunity to utilize skills, tools, and learnings from our lifes path. And Im always growing and learning. 
 Dishonesty in treatment and recovery: working the stages of change in eating disorder recovery by Kate Daigle August 17, 2012 Recovery from an eating disorder is a complex and difficult process. I believe that it takes a combination of several factors to fully recover: honesty, accountability, compassion, and determination. Treating eating disorders is also challenging because treatment may require holding all of those factors all at once and finding a balance with them in the therapeutic process. Many people enter counseling because they want to create a new way of living their lives. They have a desire to change. The readiness to change, I think, it probably the single most determining factor in actually creating a change. There are several stages of readiness to change, and clients may show up in any of these stages. The stages of readiness to change are: 1. Precontemplation  at this stage, almost all of the desire to change is external to the client, meaning they might be forced to come to therapy, they might be ambivalent about it, they may change only if the external pressure is significant enough  but this type of change is typically short-lived if not internalized. People in the precontemplation stage might feel demoralized and dont want to think about their problem because they feel that the situation is hopeless. There is certain comfort in recognizing that demoralization is a natural feeling that accompanies this stage-and in realizing that if you take yourself systematically through all the stages of change, you can change. 2. Contemplation. People in this stage realize they might be stuck and desire for things to be different. People acknowledge that they have a problem and begin to think seriously about solving it. Contemplators struggle to understand their problem, see its causes, and begin to wonder about possible solutions. Often, people in this stage are not quite ready to risk taking action, and as a result can stay in this stage for a very long period of time. 3. Preparation. This is the stage where people begin to make changes  within the next few weeks or a month. This intention is made public, perhaps by involving loved ones or support systems. It is important to feel solid in this stage and to develop a foundational plan for how to follow-through with the change; moving too quickly through it might decrease the persons chances for success. 4. Action. This is a busy period where behavior is overtly changed and modified. These changes may be more visible to other people (for example quitting smoking or decreasing eating disorder behaviors), but some of the internal work of this stage and prior stages might not be as overtly visible. 5. Maintenance. This stage is where changes and steps taken up until this point are consolidated and continually reintroduced to the client. These might be solidifying new coping mechanisms and preventing relapses. This is the longest stage of change and requires commitment and active alertness. 6. Termination: The final goal! This is where prior issues or struggles are no longer present and recovery feels solid. In eating disorder recovery, this may mean that behaviors have been eliminated for a long period of time (years) but that alertness is still required to take care of oneself and prohibit a relapse. Change involves not only modifying behaviors but learning to cope with and manage emotions in a healthier way. Lying and dishonesty in treatment and recovery from an eating disorder can come up commonly in several stages of change. Those where the most committed action is involved  Preparation and Action stages  can create confusing and conflicting emotions. When the eating disorder is directly confronted and perhaps threatened, it can try to take back control in such a direct way that it may manipulate the client into being dishonest or lying to their therapist or support system. This is an attempt to remain safe, even though it may be maladaptive. Why is this? There are a few reasons why dishonesty creeps up in recovery. It may be that the client wants to be perfect at recovery, or to please their therapist or loved ones because external validation may feel like the primary form of inner comfort. If they are struggling, they may feel like they are disappointing those who are supporting them. It also may come up as the client begins to realize the enormous loss that is felt when an eating disorder is taken away. This change requires forming new relationships with the self and learning to cope in healthier, more fulfilling ways. If the client has used the eating disorder to cope with an inner hunger or emptiness, thinking that this needs to be let go can be terrifying. It is when the client has fed that inner hunger in a more loving way that the eating disorder loses its power. It is important for clinicians to recognize the signs of dishonesty in recovery. This is a great time to enact change in the eating disorder behavioral process and to show compassion for the struggle that the client is experiencing. Holding clients accountable and challenging them is a crucial part of the recovery process. Parents and loved ones can learn more about their role in this process in an article written for parents called Your Role. It is possible to fully recover from an eating disorder. Sometimes this might mean going through a few of the stages of change several times, or staying in one for a period of time before you are ready to move on. 
 From: Physical Dangers and Effects of an Eating Disorder somethingfishy.com There are many men and women suffering with all types of Eating Disorders that do not appear in any specific weight range. Those with Anorexia can be slightly overweight... while those with Compulsive Eating can be slightly underweight. Variations for all who suffer can be anywhere from extremely underweight to extremely overweight to anywhere in between. The outward appearance of anyone with an Eating Disorder does NOT dictate the amount of physical danger they are in, nor does is determine the emotional conflict they feel inside. They need not display even close to all of the below symptoms to be in danger. Behaviors Associated with Eating Disorders Starvation and restriction of food calories and/or fat grams sometimes accompanied by self-induced vomiting, laxatives, diuretics and obsessive exercise with any food intake, or without food intake at all. Binge and Purge episodes abnormally large intake of food followed by self-induced vomiting, intake of laxatives or diuretics, obsessive exercise and/or periods of starvation. Overeating Binge Episodes -abnormally large, uncontrollable intake of food. ALL Eating Disorders are Dangerous It is important to understand that even though a person may be suffering specifically with Anorexia, Bulimia or Compulsive Overeating, it is not uncommon for them to exhibit behaviors from each of the three. It is also not uncommon for one Eating Disorder to be swapped for another (Example: a person who is suffering with Anorexia switches to Bulimia; a persons suffering with Compulsive Overeating switches to Anorexia). This is why it is important to be aware of THE DANGERS BELOW, all of which are risks no matter what Eating Disorder you suffer with. DO NOT FALL INTO THE TRAP OF THINKING "I ONLY DO THIS A FEW TIMES A MONTH SO I CAN'T BE AT RISK" OR "I DON'T DO THIS ALL THE TIME, I JUST GO THROUGH HEALTHY AND NON-HEALTHY CYCLES" -- THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE NOT IN DANGER, NOR DOES IT MEAN YOU DO NOT SUFFER FROM AN EATING DISORDER. Dangers Associated with and Diseases Triggered or Caused by Eating Disorder Behaviors Malnutrition - caused by undereating or overeating. The word malnutrition indicates deficiency for energy, protein and micronutrients (e.g. vitamin A, iodine and iron) either singularly or in combination. It can cause severe health risks including (but not limited to) respiratory infections, kidney failure, blindness, heart attack and death. Links: NutriQuest -- Body of Evidence Malnutrition Defined Dehydration - caused by the depletion or lack of intake of fluids in the body, or by restriction of carbohydrates and fat. Restriction/Starvation, vomiting and laxative abuse are the primary causes in sufferers of Eating Disorders. Symptoms include dizziness, weakness, or darkening of urine. It can lead to kidney failure, heart failure, seizures, brain damage and death. Links: Dehydration Dehydration Defined Electrolyte Imbalances - electrolyte are essential to the production of the body's "natural electricity" that ensures healthy teeth, joints and bones, nerve and muscle impulses, kidneys and heart, blood sugar levels and the delivery of oxygen to the cells. Links: The Minerals That Make Up Electrolytes Hyponatremia (related to "water-loading") - as stated above, electrolytes are essential to proper body functioning. Drinking too much water (more than eight, eight-ounce glasses in less than twelve hours), can cause Hyponatremia (not enough sodium in the blood), especially in someone already malnourished or dehydrated. Hyponatremia can cause fluid in the lungs, the brain to swell, nausea, vomiting, confusion and even death. Refeeding Syndrome (related to treatment) - Starved or severely malnourished patients can undergo life-threatening fluid and electrolyte shifts following the initiation of aggressive nutritional support therapies. This phenomenon is known as "refeeding syndrome" and can occur in patients receiving either enteral (tube feeding) or parenteral (intravenous feeding) nutritional support. To avoid the development of the refeeding syndrome, nutrition support in patients at risk should be increased slowly while assuring adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals. Organ function, fluid balance and serum electrolytes (especially phosphorus, potassium and magnesium) need to be monitored daily during the first week and less often thereafter. Links: Refeeding Syndrome Monitoring Nutrition Therapy Vitamin and Mineral Deficiencies Lanugo - (soft downy hair on face, back and arms). This is caused due to a protective mechanism built-in to the body to help keep a person warm during periods of starvation and malnutrition, and the hormonal imbalances that result. Edema - swelling of the soft tissues as a result of excess water accumulation. It is most common in the legs and feet of Compulsive Overeaters and in the abdominal area of Anorexics and/or Bulimics (can be caused by Laxative and Diuretic use). Muscle Atrophy - wasting away of muscle and decrease in muscle mass due to the body feeding off of itself. Impaired Neuromuscular Function - due to vitamin and mineral deficiencies (specifically potassium), and malnutrition. Links: Muscle Atrophy Defined Paralysis - transient (or temporary) paralysis -- extreme weakness of muscles or not being able to move at all -- Caused by low levels of potassium, and/or the degeneration of nerve cells, in the spinal cord or in the brain, which have been deprived of essential nutrients. Left untreated, periods of paralysis may happen more frequently and more severely, lead to permanent muscle weakness, and even result in death. Tearing of Esophagus - caused by self-induced vomiting Mallory-Weiss tear - associate with vomiting, a tear of the gastroesophageal junction Gastric Rupture - spontaneous stomach erosion, perforation or rupture. Gastrointestinal Bleeding - bleeding into the digestive tract. Links: Gastrointestinal Bleeding Information Esophageal Reflux - Acid Reflux Disorders - partially digested items in the stomach, mixed with acid and enzymes, regurgitates back into the esophagus. This can lead to damage to the esophagus, larynx and lungs and increases the chances of developing cancer of the esophagus and voice box. Reflux can sometimes become severe enough that food cannot be kept down at all and medical attention should be sought immediately. Barrett's Esophagus - associated with Cancer of the esophagus and caused by Esophageal Reflux, this is a change in the cells within the esophagus. Links: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Barrett's esophagus Cancer - of the throat and voice box (Larynx) due to acid reflux disorders. Links: Cancer of the Larynx Insomnia - having problems falling and/or staying asleep. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome - continuous and crippling fatigue related to a weakened immune system. Links: The CFIDS Association Hyperactivity - manic bouts of not being able to sit still. Swelling - in face and cheeks (following self-induced vomiting). Callused or bruised fingers - this is caused by repeatedly using the fingers to induce vomiting. Dry Skin and Hair, Brittle Hair and Nails, Hair Loss - cause by Vitamin and Mineral deficiencies, malnutrition and dehydration. Low Blood Pressure, Hypotension (more common in those with Anorexia and/or Bulimia) - cause by lowered body temperature, malnutrition and dehydration. Can cause heart arrhythmias, shock or myocardial infarction. Links: Low Blood Pressure Orthostatic Hypotension - sudden drop in blood pressure upon sitting up or standing. Symptoms include dizziness, blurred vision, passing out, heart pounding and headaches. Links: Orthostatic Hypotension High Blood Pressure, Hypertension (more common in those with Compulsive Overeating and/or Binge Eating Disorder) - elevated blood pressure exceeding 140 over 90. Can cause: blood vessel changes in the back of the eye creating vision impairment; abnormal thickening of the heart muscle; kidney failure; and brain damage. Links: Hypertension Low Platelet Count or Thrombocytopenia - Caused by low levels of vitamin B12 and Folic Acid, and/or by excessive alcohol. It may also be an indication of a suppressed immune system or immune dysfunction. Links: Thrombocytopenia Disruptions in Blood Sugar Levels - Low Blood Sugar/Hypoglycemia: can indicate problems with the liver or kidneys and can lead to neurological and mental deterioration. Links: Reactive Hypoglycemia Homepage Elevated Blood Sugar/Hyperglycemia - can lead to diabetes, liver and kidney shut down, circulatory and immune system problems. Diabetes - high blood sugar as a result of low production of insulin. This can be caused by hormonal imbalances, hyperglycemia, or chronic pancreatitis. Links: Eating Disorders and Diabetes Ketoacidosis - high levels of acids that build up in the blood (known as ketones) caused by the body burning fat (instead of sugar and carbohydrates) to get energy. It can be a result of starvation, excessive purging, dehydration, hyperglycemia and/or alcohol abuse (it can also be a result of uncontrolled or untreated diabetes). It can lead to coma and death. Links: Diabetic ketoacidosis Alcohol Ketoacidosis *You do not need to be diabetic or alcoholic to end up with Ketoacidosis! Iron Deficiency, Anemia - this makes the oxygen transporting units within the blood useless and can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, increased infections, and heart palpitations. Links: Anemia Anemia Kidney Infection and Failure - your kidneys "clean" the poisons from your body, regulate acid concentration and maintain water balance. Vitamin Deficiencies, dehydration, infection and low blood pressure increase the risks of and associated with kidney infection thus making permanent kidney damage and kidney failure more likely. Osteoporosis - Thinning of the bones with reduction in bone mass due to depletion of calcium and bone protein, predisposing to fractures. Osteopenia - Below normal bone mass indicating a calcium and/or vitamin D deficiency and leading to Osteoporosis. * Hormone imbalance/deficiencies associated with the loss of the menstrual cycle can also increase your risks of Osteoporosis and Osteopenia. Arthritis (degenerative) - can be caused by hormonal imbalances and vitamin deficiencies as well as increased stress on the joints in individuals who suffering Compulsive Overeating. TMJ "Syndrome" and Related TMJ Problems - degenerative arthritis within the tempero-mandibular joint in the jaw (where the lower jaw hinges to the skull) creating pain in the joint area, headaches, and problems chewing and opening/closing the mouth. Vitamin deficiencies and teeth grinding (often related to stress) can both be causes. Links: Toothaches and TMJ Syndrome The TMJ Association Amenorrhea - Loss of Menstrual Cycle (due to lack of secreting hormone, Oestrogen, by the ovaries). Loss of the menstrual cycle can also lead to Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Links: Secondary Amenorrhea Easily Bruising Skin - Vitamin Deficiencies that decrease the body's ability to heal itself, low blood pressure, low platelets count and/or extreme weight loss will all lead to easily bruised skin that can take a long time to heal. Dental Problems, Decalcification of teeth, erosion of tooth enamel, severe decay, Gum Disease - will be caused by stomach acids and enzymes (from vomiting); vitamin D and calcium deficiencies, and hormonal imbalance. Can also be due to the lack of exercise the teeth can get from the process of eating certain foods. Dental problems can sometime indicate problems with the heart. Links: Toothaches and TMJ Syndrome Dental Erosion Liver Failure - the liver aids in removing waste from cells, and aids in digestion. You cannot live without your Liver. Fasting and taking acetaminophen (drug found in over-the-counter pain killers) increases your risks for Liver damage and failure. Loss of menstruation and dehydration (putting women at risk for too much iron in their system), and chronic heart failure can lead to liver damage or failure. Bad Circulation, Slowed or Irregular Heartbeat, Arrhythmias, Angina, Heart Attack - There are many factors associated with having an Eating Disorder that can lead to heart problems or a heart attack. Sudden cardiac arrest can cause permanent damage to the heart, or instant death... electrolyte imbalances (especially potassium deficiency), dehydration, malnutrition, low blood pressure, extreme orthostatic hypotension, abnormally slow heart rate, electrolyte imbalances, and hormonal imbalances can all cause serious problems with the heart, high blood pressure, accumulation of fat deposits around the heart muscle, high cholesterol, decreased exercise due to lack of mobility, diabetes and hormonal imbalances can all lead to serious problems with the heart. Infertility - the inability to have children. Caused by loss of menstrual cycle, and hormonal imbalances. Malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies can also make it impossible to succeed with a full-term pregnancy, and can increase the chances significantly of a baby born with birth defects. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome - a study a few years ago suggested that people with Eating Disorders were at an increased risk for developing Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCO), and that recovery from the Eating Disorder should be part of treatment for PCO. Links: International Council on Infertility Problems during pregnancy - including potential for high risk pregnancies, miscarriage, still born babies and death or chronic illness from minor to severe, in children born (all due to malnutrition, dehydration, vitamin and hormone deficiencies). Links: Eating Disorders and Pregnancy Depression - mood swings and depression can be cause by physiological factors such as electrolyte imbalances, hormone and vitamin deficiencies, malnutrition and dehydration. Living with the Eating Disorder behaviors themselves will cause depression. Depression can also lead the sufferer back into the cycle of the Eating Disorder (or may have initially been the problem before the onset of the ED). Stress within family, job and relationships can all be causes. There are also a percentage of people born with a pre-disposition to depression, based on family history. Can lead to Suicide Also see: Associations and Addictions Lowered body temperature - Temperature Sensitivity - caused by loss of healthy insulating layer of fat and lowered blood pressure. Cramps, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, incontinence - increased or decreased bowel activity.

It can be caused by repeated stomach trauma (such as with vomiting), alcohol consumption or the excessive use of laxatives or diet pills. Links: Pancreatitis Digestive Difficulties - a deficiency in digestive enzymes will lead to the bodies inability to properly digest food and absorb nutrients. This can lead to malabsorption problems, malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances. Diseases that may be triggered by a history of an Eating Disorder include: Celiac Disease (gluten sensitivity), and Crohn's Disease Links: Celiac.com The Connection Gastrointestinal Disorder DigestInfo.com Weakness and Fatigue - caused by generalized poor eating habits, electrolyte imbalances, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, depression, malnutrition, heart problems. Seizures - the increased risk of seizures in Anorexic and Bulimic individuals may be caused by dehydration, hyperglycemia or ketoacidosis. It is also possible that lesions on the brain caused by long-term malnutrition and lack of oxygen-carrying cells to the brain may play a role. SOME type of antidepressants can increase the risk of seizure and usually carry a warning against prescribing them to people with Eating Disorders, unless the benefits significantly outweigh the risks. Death -caused by any of the following or any combination of the following: heart attack or heart failure; lung collapse; internal bleeding, stroke, kidney failure, liver failure; pancreatitis, gastric rupture, perforated ulcer, depression and suicide.

 Eating Disorders Hitting Women Over 50, Study Finds By Steven Reinberg, HealthDay June 21, 2012 Researcher says new treatment strategies needed to target this older population. Although eating disorders are typically thought of as a problem among teenage girls, many women over 50 practice unhealthy eating behaviors, a new study indicates. The researchers found that almost 4 percent report binge eating, nearly 8 percent report purging, more than 70 percent diet to lose weight and 62 percent say their weight or shape adversely impacts their lives, according to the report published June 21 in the International Journal of Eating Disorders. "Everyone -- especially health-care providers -- needs to erase stereotypes about who experiences disordered eating. Women well into their 50s and beyond still report struggling with weight dissatisfaction and a palette of unhealthy behaviors aimed at weight control," said lead researcher Cynthia Bulik, director of the University of North Carolina Eating Disorders Program. "Our '70 is the new 50' society may be placing additional appearance pressures on women that perpetuate disordered eating practices well into older adulthood," she added. These messages cause dissatisfaction and lead women toward extreme measures to achieve these "societally concocted ideals," Bulik said. For the study, Bulik's team collected data on more than 1,800 U.S. women who took part in the Gender and Body Image Study. Among these women, about 27 percent were obese, 29 percent were overweight, 42 percent were normal weight and 2 percent were underweight, the study authors noted. About 8 percent of women said they purged in the last five years and 3.5 percent said they had binged in the past month, the investigators found. Most of these women were in their early 50s, but there were also women over 75, the authors said. In addition, 36 percent of the women said they spent at least half their time in the last five years dieting, 41 percent said they checked their body size or shape daily and 40 percent weighed themselves at least twice a week. Moreover, 62 percent said their weight or shape had a negative impact on their life, 79 percent said it affected their image of themselves and 64 percent said they thought about it daily. Many women resorted to unhealthy ways to lose weight, including diet pills (7.5 percent), excessive exercise (7 percent), diuretics (2.5 percent), laxatives (2 percent) and vomiting (1 percent), the researchers found. In all, 66 percent didn't like their overall appearance. Their dissatisfaction was highest with their stomach (84 percent) and shape (73 percent). "We simply cannot ignore disordered eating and weight dissatisfaction in women over 50," Bulik said. "But, we have no idea how to tailor interventions for women over 50 so treatment can be appropriate to their developmental stage in life. That is a critical next step," she said. Eating disorders can have dire consequences, Bulik noted. "Anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness. Although we do not have clear data on differences in mortality across the age spectrum, we do know that the body becomes less resilient to the physical insults from starvation, binge eating and purging as it ages. So these disorders in older women may lead to even more medical complications because the body bounces back less easily as it ages," she said. Bulik said there are signs to look out for that may indicate someone has an eating disorder. These include: precipitous weight loss or low weight; withdrawing from family, partner and friends; evidence of binge eating or purging; extremely low self-esteem and body esteem; not eating with the family; avoiding events where there is food. "Partners can be so helpful, but often do not know what to do. Inform yourself about eating disorders and don't expect the problem just to go away. These are not just passing phases, these are serious and potentially life-threatening disorders that require treatment," she said. Commenting on the study, Dr. Edith Rubenstein, an attending psychiatrist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said: "This is an unrecognized problem. It had been thought the problem was much smaller." But, she added, "All of these weight and shape concerns are taking up a lot of mental space in women in this age group, surprisingly." There is a growing older population of women who are heavier, which may be contributing to this anxiety about weight and shape, Rubenstein said. These are serious problems that need attention, she explained. "If you have excessive concerns about weight and shape, if you are obsessing about weight and shape, if you are engaging in unhealthy behaviors like bingeing and purging, you should seek medical attention," Rubenstein advised.

 Indicators of Eating Disorder Recovery: Where Are You on the Journey to Recovery? by Kate May 15, 2012 A few weeks ago, I went to a panel of eating disorder professionals in Boulder, Colorado, which was the final event in the Journey to Wholeness: From Anorexia to Addiction, Bipolar Disorder and Recovery series sponsored by the Interfaith Network on Mental Illness and featuring renowned author Marya Hornbacher (author of such groundbreaking books as Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia, and Madness: A Bipolar Life, among many others). The panel, featuring local eating disorder psychotherapist Isabelle Tierney and Toni Saiber, executive board member of the Eating Disorder Foundation, was truly inspiring to me as a mental health professional working with eating disorders, as well as someone who has recovered from my own eating disorder. The panel members had all recovered themselves from eating disorders as well, and I appreciated the candidness about what it is like for them to pursue the passion in life of helping others find recovery. A resounding theme of the event was HOPE. What place does hope have in eating disorder recovery? How does it support people in their journeys towards wholeness? All panel members agreed that their own personal experiences have influenced and informed their practice today in a way that makes them, resoundingly, human. I was inspired by the authenticity of panel members: sometimes, when Ive had a challenging week, I still have to notice how I try to use food to cope; recovery is a lifetime process, always evolving, always present; Ive learned that when I said no to my eating disorder, there were things I then had to say yes to, which was challenging at first. These are the voices of recovery, spoken by those who are so inspired by this journey that they now make it their lifes work to help others. I left with a renewed spirit, a passionate drive, a dedication to commit myself to my own lifes path: to help others find their recovery, too. I was given a handout at the panel, one so useful that I have shared it with many of my clients. Its entitled Indicators of Recovery and I have attached it as a PDF at the end of this post. One of the things I love about this handout is that NONE of the indicators have to do with food, weight, or appearance. There is no counting or numbers. These are indicators to a healthy and balanced life, and can be applied to anyone and everyone  not just those with an ED. I like going through this with clients so that, on the sometimes tough days of recovery, they can see where they are and what theyve already done in terms of recovery. The first step is asking for help and thats a HUGE one  maybe the most important one of all. I want to point out a few of these indicators that really stand out to me, as a possible jump-off point to further discussion and reflection: Learning slips and relapses are signs that something else is really going on and forgiving yourself while investigating the cause. This is one of the more challenging tasks in recovery but one that is essential in embracing the process of the recovery roller coaster. Just because you might have a slip does not mean that you have gone backwards. Slips are opportunities to learn and to practice compassion.Possessing a desire to change. So simple sounding, yet so complex. A clients readiness to change indicates where they are on the journey to recovery and what challenges and what tasks he/she may find as they move forward. I believe that this factor, as well as asking for help, are the two most essential factors to defining recovery.Feeling negative emotions (or challenging) and knowing it is possible to live through them without needing to numb them. This concept is one of the core concepts of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a therapeutic approach that I use in my practice. Learning to sit with feelings, believe that they will pass, and not allowing them to overpower other emotions or desires is an integral part of recovery. We all have feelings, some more challenging than others, and we do not have to allow them to control our experiences.Becoming autonomous and not comparing yourself to others. We are all beautiful and unique in our own ways. Finding and relishing in that inner beauty is the antidote to eating disorder behavior. Many more Indicators to Recovery are found in the PDF: Indicators of Recovery Whether you are a professional, a person who is trying to recover from an eating disorder, or a loved one of someone with an eating disorder, I hope you find this pdf helpful. Which of these indicators are you embracing in your life today? Which are you working on now? Which are goals you have for your recovery?

 Aging and Anorexia: Silent Crisis of Eating Disorders in Older Women? by Pamela Cytrynbaum, Psychology Today March 6, 2012 Are older women silently starving themselves? National Eating Disorders Awareness Week just ended and I think that should be the beginning of our conversation, not the end. There is a lot of helpful information available on how younger and younger kids are struggling with eating disorders, how 5-year-old girls are saying they are "fat" and how boys are now struggling in significant numbers with one of the deadliest mental illnesses there is. What you probably have not read, seen or heard much about is the increase in eating disorders among older people, particularly women. There was so little information, in fact, that I checked in with the folks at Eating Recovery Center, where I have gotten a lot of expert advice on eating disorders. Turns out, they are seeing a real upswing in cases of older people struggling with eating disorders and thought it was a great topic to explore. It presents with similarities and differences than the disordered eating in younger women, but because older people are more vulnerable in many ways, an eating disorder in midlife and beyond can be even more dangerous. Dr. Emmett Bishop, MD, FAED, CEDS, founding partner and medical director of adult services at Eating Recovery Center, was kind enough to take time to help educate me - and now you - on this silent but significant issue. Q: What are the myths surrounding eating disorders in older people and what are the facts? Dr. Bishop: "The biggest myth is that this group does not have eating disorders. Although this group has flown under the radar, we are seeing quite a few women in treatment in their 40s, 50s and 60s. We even recently treated an 80-year-old woman." Dr. Bishop warns that one of the most damaging and dangerous aspects of eating disorders in the aging is that too often, family members will assume the weight loss is related to simply being old, or "that's just the way she is," rather than exploring if something is going on. Q: Describe the signs/symptoms family members should look for, especially in their elderly relatives and friends. Dr. Bishop: "The signs and symptoms of an eating disorder are very similar to what you would see in the younger group: weight loss, avoiding situations where food will be available, excessive exercise, obsessions with calories and weight, using the bathroom directly after a meal and becoming more secretive or withdrawn. The biggest problem I have seen with the older group is people "blowing off" symptoms because the individual displaying them has behaved that way for a long time. Oftentimes, friends and family will say "that's just they way she is" until they see their loved one begin to develop medical complications." Q: If you suspect an older loved one has an eating disorder, what should you do? Dr. Bishop: "We see a lot of middle-aged patients entering treatment on their own because they feel like they are bad role models for their teenaged daughters. Many elderly individuals will seek treatment once they have experienced a medical complication. The goal is to help them get treatment before medical issues happen. If you are worried, try to find a neutral setting in which to speak with your loved one. Express your concerns using non-judgmental language. Point out behaviors that you have noticed but do your best not to blame or shame. Offer to help your loved one seek treatment from a qualified professional. If expressing your concerns does not work, try to get as many people as you can together, express your concerns for your loved one's health and try to get him or her into treatment." Q: Can you make distinctions between two populations — midlifers with eating disorders and elderly with eating disorders? Dr. Bishop: "Distinctions between the two groups really have not been studied. However, in my clinical experience, many of the eating disorders I have seen in older women – versus those in midlife – are atypical. In older women, I have seen more eating disorders develop not from dieting, but rather, from intense food phobias." Q: Does the disease look or progress differently in the aging population? If so, how? Dr. Bishop: "This needs to be studied more carefully. However, from my clinical impression, we see a lot of medical complications, such as kidney dysfunction, cardiac issues and other medical problems, in the elderly group that we do not see in the younger group." Q: What are the differences between an adolescent with an eating disorder and an older person? Dr. Bishop: "In my experience, adolescents tend to display more denial and have less self-awareness about their eating disorders. Adolescents do not have the motivation to get out of their eating disorder because they do not see a reason to. Whereas, older individuals generally are very aware of their eating disorders and they do not want to have the disease, but they do not see a way out." Q: What triggers eating disorders among older women? Are the triggers different than younger people? Dr. Bishop: "A great deal of older women were triggered by an activity such as dieting when they were younger and have been suffering with their eating disorders for years and years. However, it is not out of the realm of possibility to see an older woman develop an eating disorder for the first time at an older age. Generally, I see late onset eating disorders more related to a medical condition; for example, a physical illness that has induced weight loss. The common factor is weight loss, but what precipitated the weight loss is different." Q: I would assume most elderly people with eating disorders had them when they were younger too. Is that a myth? Dr. Bishop: "Late onset is probably very rare. The individuals we typically see are those who have had an eating disorder for a long time and have relapsed from prior treatment or are entering treatment for the first time." Q: What are the additional health issues/risks in play for older people with eating disorders? Dr. Bishop: "Older individuals have much less resilience when it comes to physical damage from eating disorders. A lot of things can go wrong with vital organs, bone density can be impacted, dental health can suffer, and as tissues become less elastic, I've seen people aspirate from purging. A whole host of medical issues can arise as people abuse their bodies over time. Eating disorders are the deadliest mental illnesses and premature death is very common." Q: Are there books, articles, websites, resources you can recommend to our readers? Dr. Bishop: "Related to middle aged and elderly individuals, there is not a lot of age-specific information out there. The National Eating Disorders Association offers a wealth of general information about eating disorders and access to resources on its website, Eating Recovery Center additionally offers a number of resources, as well as confidential online chat with our intake team at Eating Recovery Center." 
 Eating Disorders In Middle Age Bring Unique Challenges, Treatments by Mary Kate Sheridan, Associate Editor, Huffington Post 03/02/12 While young women are often the faces of eating disorders, diseases such as anorexia, bulimia and binge eating can affect any age -- and recent data suggest the numbers are rising among middle-aged women. The issue is in the spotlight in the U.S. during National Eating Disorders Awareness Week, which runs through March 3. Post 50 women with eating disorders, known as "EDs," may face unique emotional and physical issues. “Women at mid-life now have unprecedented opportunities and also unprecedented stresses,” Merryl Bear, director of Canada's National Eating Disorder Information Centre, told the Toronto Star. “There’s an increased fear of aging and societal pressures to change one’s body to bring it closer to the societal ideal.” From 2001 to 2010, the rate of EDs among the middle-aged increased by 42 percent, said Holly Grishkat, Ph.D., regional assistant vice president and director of The Renfrew Center in Radnor, Pa., an eating disorder treatment center. An Australian study published in 2008 also revealed a rise in eating disorders in older adults, particularly with binge eating and food restriction. The study found that in adults between 55 and 64, binge eating increased from 1.7 percent in 1995 to 7.4 percent in 2005, and strict dieting or fasting increased from zero percent in 1995 to 9.7 percent in 2005. While concerning, these numbers may largely reflect individuals with histories of eating problems, rather than new cases, experts say. Many who face eating disorders in midlife have confronted them in the past. In fact, 94 percent of middle-aged women who are anorexic developed the disorder when they were younger. "It’s rare -- not impossible, but rare -- for a woman 50 or beyond to develop an eating disorder for the first time," said Dr. Margo Maine, clinical psychologist and co-author of The Body Myth: Adult Women and the Pressure to Be Perfect. "Most in their 50s and 60s are women who had eating disorders when they were younger." That doesn't mean middle-agers' experiences with eating disorders are the same, however. Since EDs are frequently associated with younger women, older adults may be ashamed to admit that they have these disorders. As one middle-ager confided on a message board: "People always refer to bulimia as an adolescent disease; I feel like such a failure that I’m almost 50." Grishkat believes shame is a significant component of eating disorders in middle age. "I think women who are coming out with it in midlife feel like 'I should be the role model here and not the one with the disorder,'" she said. Older women often remain silent during group therapy sessions with younger women, Grishkat added. Acknowledging these struggles, Renfrew has created a program called "30-Something And Beyond," which is specifically for adult women who suffer from EDs. This in-patient program places women with roommates of a similar age and in therapy groups that focus on issues more likely to affect middle-agers. (Renfrew also provides outpatient, midlife-focused therapy groups.) Through this program, Renfrew can focus on triggers that are specific to its middle-aged patients. One such trigger is loss, which "tends to be a big underlying factor for eating disorders," Grishkat said. Midlifers may be dealing with a range of loss, from ailing and dying parents to children moving out, to divorce -- factors that may not resonate with the younger generation. One post 50 who has dealt with loss and an eating disorder is Mary Sponhaltz, who discussed her experience with The Eating Disorder Center of Denver. Sponhaltz struggled with anorexia in the wake of her father's death from cancer. Over three years, Sponhaltz tended to her father, leaving her husband and children for long periods. “I was already worn thin emotionally and losing weight drastically when he was alive because I wasn’t taking care of myself," Sponhaltz told The Eating Disorder Center of Denver. "But once he died, the eating disorder kicked in. It numbed me so I wouldn’t have to feel.” Aging is another potential trigger. Physical changes in midlife may cause or reignite eating disorders. As psychiatrist Anne E. Becker -- director of the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital and president of the Academy for Eating Disorders -- recently told Harvard Women's Health Watch: As our society values youth and as baby-boomers reinvent what it means to be middle-aged, there are growing social forces that can undermine older women's self-esteem and potentially lead to body dissatisfaction — for example, if you think the surface of your skin or the contours of your body aren't supposed to match your chronological age. That, combined with health concerns about obesity, can make people feel bad about their bodies and, in turn, could result in eating strategies that undermine well-being. In an Austrian study of 475 women between 60 and 70 years old, published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders in 2006, 45 percent of the women indicated that their self-esteem depended on their shape and weight. The same study revealed that "over 60 percent [of the women] stated 'moderate' or 'low' satisfaction with weight and shape." This pressure to maintain youth may stem from the culture in which post 50s grew up. Dr. Blake Woodside, director of Toronto General Hospital's in-patient eating disorder program, told the Toronto Star that the increase in midlife eating disorders can be traced to the '60s, when ideals changed and the "thin is in" culture materialized. Whatever the cause, eating disorders can have serious side effects, including osteoporosis, heart problems and gastrointestinal issues. In a recent interview with Life Goes Strong, an online site for midlifers, Dr. Emmett Bishop, MD, FAED, CEDS -- founding partner and medical director of adult services at the Eating Recovery Center -- outlined some specific health issues that middle-agers with EDs may face: Older individuals have much less resilience when it comes to physical damage from eating disorders. A lot of things can go wrong with vital organs, bone density can be impacted, dental health can suffer, and as tissues become less elastic, I've seen people aspirate from purging. A whole host of medical issues can arise as people abuse their bodies over time. Eating disorders are the deadliest mental illnesses and premature death is very common. Older women also face somber statistics when it comes to EDs and death. Senior women comprise 78 percent of all deaths caused by anorexia, and the average age that women die from the disease is 69. But middle-agers with EDs shouldn't give up. "There's hope," Grishkat said. "Even if you've had [an eating disorder] for 30 years, our data show that the women in midlife and older tend to be more determined and ready for recovery than a lot of the younger women."

 Theres a new word in the dictionary: the advent of thinspo and its menacing grip on young girls self worth by Kate Daigle, Kate Daigle Counseling Blog Feb 16, 2012 Theres a new word in the {Tumblr} dictionary: thinspo (n.): short for thin-spirational, photos of wafer-thin girls, pro-anorexia quotes. The culture devoted to thinspo is primarily found on Tumblr but also is awash in blogs and sites all over the internet. Those who are active in it use acronyms across the top of their webpages, like a banner to describe their work: CW (current weight), SW (starting weight), UGW (ultimate goal weight). Carolyn Gregoire of the Huffington Post recently wrote an article THE HUNGER BLOGS: A Secret World of Teenage Thinspiration wherein she uncovers this codependent sisterhood of bloggers uses Tumblr for one sole purpose: to lose extreme and unhealthy amounts of weight. Throughout my work with eating disorders and during my own struggle, I have encountered pro-ana (pro-anorexia) and pro-mia (pro-bulimia) sites which give advice and tips on how to have the best eating disorder possible. These sites are incredibly toxic for the influence they can have on young girls and boys who may not know anything about eating disorders before coming upon them. Harriet Brown, author of Brave Girl Eating: A Familys Struggle with Anorexia wrote a blog post piggy-backing onto Ms. Gregoires post, during which she acknowledges that thinspo and other pro-ED sites are technically allowed because of the First Amendments liberty of self-expression, but thinspo is not self-expression because its not these young womens true selves that invite emaciation and worship at the altar of jutting hipbones. The longing for extreme thinness, for the self-annhilation of starvation, is not rational. Its not a choice. Its the expression of an underlying terror and compulsion that controls a persons thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. In other words, the eating disorder is writing the words for these young women. Ms. Browns post, entitled A Mothers Plea to Shut the Hunger Blogs, is written from the heart  from someone who knows what its like to have a daughter affected by the messages from these sites. She writes: If my older daughter had never developed anorexia, I might be more sympathetic to the notion that thinspo is a genuine form of self-expression. One of the dangers of thinspo is that the words and intent can come from a vulnerable place of wanting to express something. Eating disorders develop for some kind of reason, they help to cope with something, and behind the dangerous messages of thinspo lie millions of hurt, scared, and sick young women who underneath it all just want to be loved for who they are. They just dont know how to express that and are afraid to be rejected. This may be why Ms. Brown says that she has empathy for these young women even as their words nauseate me: the real issue isnt the development of these sites but the underlying cultural acceptance of the drive to be thin. And to do almost ANYTHING to get there  thinness is more valued in our culture than intelligence, curiosity, creativity or JOY. Now that is pretty twisted. Yahoo says it has dismantled over one hundred thinspo sites due to violation of the sites terms of use; this is a start, but the sites will keep on coming. We can take all of the sites off the internet, and this will be a great step in the direction of decreasing pro-ED education. However, the real issue is the way that thinness, fitness (yes, theres another new word: fit-spo, short for fit-spirational, showing photos of fit girls and inspirational fitness quotes), and competitive drive are placed in the spotlight as qualities that lead to happiness and success. Yes, they may lead to a healthy lifestyle, but if these messages are heard by ears that are consumed by our culture and are already pre-disposed to eating disordered behaviors, they can lead to a full-blown eating disorder that takes their lives away from them. As Ms. Brown cites: In part because of our cultural obsession with thinness, we have trouble seeing anorexia and other eating disorders as illnesses. As real illnesses, the kind you cant snap yourself out of. And thats the main reason I would shut down every thinspo blog and Tumblr if I could: Because the girls and young women who so eagerly perpetuate them are ill. Theyre not stupid or vain or misguided; they are profoundly, mortally sick. We are making ourselves sick. We consume and purchase, trying to fit the standard that must be the way to find a lifetime of happiness. The truth is that we will never find what we are looking for in that way; the only way we will find what we yearn for is to look within ourselves, listen to our voice, and take the steps to follow our own unique, authentic path back to ourselves. On the advent on Eating Disorders Awareness Week, lets hear your voice! 
 Orthorexia: Where Eating Disorders Meet OCD OCD Center of Los Angeles Tuesday, July 12th, 2011 Orthorexia – The Not-So-Healthy Obsession with “Healthy” Eating Orthorexia Nervosa (also simply known as Orthorexia) is a relatively new term within the psychological and medical fields. Simply defined, Orthorexia is an eating disorder in which an individual has an excessive and ultimately unhealthy obsession about maintaining a diet that is totally “healthy” and “pure”. Because of their extremely restrictive eating, individuals with Orthorexia are often severely underweight, and frequently lack the proper nourishment to perform basic daily activities. Like most cases involving an eating disorder, the outcome of Orthorexia can be severe malnutrition and a significant reduction of one’s quality of life. Orthorexia has not yet been accepted as a formal diagnosis by the psychiatric community, and has not been defined within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV). However, since first being described by Dr. Steven Bratman in 1996, many health professionals have observed the often debilitating results of this condition. Symptoms of Orthorexia Like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Orthorexia can be conceptualized as a constellation of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. The most prominent obsession seen in Orthorexia is an excessive concern about the healthfulness of food. Those with Orthorexia often spend many hours of the day planning and obsessing about what foods they have eaten or will eat, the nutritional content of that food, and how that food has been grown, processed, and/or prepared. Individuals with Orthorexia may obsess about any number of nutritional aspects of food, including, but not limited to the following: CaloriesSugar (especially “refined” sugar)High fructose corn syrupFatHydrogenated or partially hydrogenated fat (trans fats)ProteinCarbohydratesGlycemic indexSalt / sodiumFiberGlutenDairy productsFatty acidsVitamin and mineral content of the foodWhether or not a food is “whole” or “organic”Whether or not a food is sufficiently vegan, vegetarian, or macrobioticWhether or not a food is genetically modified The most obvious behavioral symptom of Orthorexia is the compulsive avoidance of foods that the sufferer deems unhealthy or impure. Individuals with Orthorexia may at first simply eliminate a few specific foods from their diet, but over time, their diets often become more and more restrictive. Eventually, they may eat only a select small number of foods that have been prepared in a manner that they have decided is “correct” or “pure”. At the same time, they may also purchase many expensive, “natural” or “organic” health food products and supplements that they perceive as more pure and/or healthy than traditional foods. In addition to food avoidance, individuals with Orthorexia will often spend excessive amounts of time researching food issues related to the above concerns. This research may include many hours of internet searching, buying and reading an excessive amount of food, health, and nutrition related books, and near-constant examination of food labels when shopping for groceries at the market. For individuals with Orthorexia, the obsessive concern with what goes into their bodies may also extend to other, non-food related health issues. Often, they have a disproportionate level of fear related to the possibility of exposure to what they perceive as pathogens in everyday products and in the environment. This may result in compulsive avoidance of certain soaps, shampoos, perfumes, and deodorants, as well as x-rays, vaccinations, or even mercury in dental fillings. They may broadly reject much of western medical science in favor of homeopathy, osteopathy, and other “complementary” and “alternative medicine” approaches. It is also common for those with Orthorexia to spend much of their social time discussing food, and attempting to convince others of the “correct” way to eat. This may result in conflict with families and friends who do not agree with their views, and who take offense when the person with Orthorexia repeatedly criticizes their food choices. Likewise, those with Orthorexia may take offense when friends and family express their concerns about the health and dietary choices of the sufferer. On a more internal, psychological level, those suffering with Orthorexia often experience significant guilt and shame when they do not maintain their purist dietary rules. They are usually extremely strict with themselves about their diet and their overall health, and are often overly judgmental towards themselves and their ability to control what they eat. Frequently, much of their self-esteem and sense of identity is rooted in their diet and in their success in satisfying their high levels of self-discipline. Diagnosis and Relationship to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder While some see Orthorexia as an eating disorder, many mental health experts agree that it is best conceptualized as a hybrid of an eating disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Like OCD, Orthorexia is defined by the individual’s obsessive thoughts (in this case, thoughts about certain foods being dangerously unhealthy), and the compulsive behaviors done in an effort to minimize the anxiety caused by those obsessive thoughts (in this case, food avoidance, as well as the other behaviors noted above). The food avoidance seen in Orthorexia also has an obvious relationship to Anorexia. In fact, many with Orthorexia are eventually diagnosed with Anorexia as a result of weight loss related to their food avoidance. And some mental health clinicians see Orthorexia as a behavioral symptom of Anorexia in which the individual uses the issue of “healthfulness” as a justification for not eating. It is also worth noting that some with Orthorexia will resort to purging behaviors similar to those seen in Bulimia in an effort to rid their bodies of impurities that they believe they may have ingested. Purging behaviors may include vomiting, use of laxatives and emetics, and use of colon cleansers to rid themselves of alleged toxins. Likewise, similar to those with Anorexia and Bulimia, individuals with Orthorexia often perform other compensatory behaviors such as compulsive exercising in an effort to make their bodies as perfect and pure as possible. Symptoms of Orthorexia also overlap with those of other Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum Disorders. The excessive focus on “healthfulness” leads many to develop a distorted over-concern with their actual health, not unlike those with Hypochondria (also known as Health Anxiety). Likewise, many with Orthorexia have a distorted body image, much like those with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). Because of the extreme restrictions commonly seen in this condition, it is often very difficult for those with Orthorexia to eat socially, or even be in social places at all. As result of trying to avoid being confronted about their food obsession, many with Orthorexia develop a pattern of social avoidance similar to that of Social Anxiety. The result is often a reduction in social interaction, and in some cases, a complete severing of friendships and relationships in order to maintain and protect their diet. Finally, it is worth noting the overlap between phobias and Orthorexia. The two primary distinguishing features of phobias are the sufferer’s irrational fear of a specific object or event, and their subsequent efforts to avoid exposure to that object or event. Some conceptualize Orthorexia as essentially being a food phobia, in which the individual is terrified of being exposed to foods that they irrationally see as imminent threats to their well-being. 
 I recently had very much needed gastric bypass surgery. Although I know the surgery is only a tool and not a fix all, I was very hopeful that this would be the start of my new healthy life. What I wasn't prepared for were my old thoughts from when I was bulimic (almost 10 years ago). Although I had gained a lot of weight since my bulimia I still believed that I had an eating disorder just a binge eating disorder. Before my surgery any time I would try to diet I would swing from one extreme to the other (one side being eating anything and everything and the other side being extrememly restrictive). I truely thought that I had conquered this issue and that it wouldn't be a problem after surgery because I would naturally be eating very small portions so I would not feel like I had to restrict. Wrong!!! I am already only eating a third of what I am supposed to be eating and still feel like that is too many calories. I'm not sure how to challenge my thoughts. They are the exact same thoughts I have had any other time I have tried to diet. Those thoughts being "you need to eat less", "you're getting too many calories", "that is a bad food" ect. I feel like a failure for not being able to conquer these feelings despite being 10 years older than when my bulimia started and also I have received help from at least 2 differenct therapist for this issue and from one hospitilization. I'm not really ready to see another therapist about this but I would be open to reading books that might be helpful. Also any advice would be most appreciated! Thank you! 
 Eating Disorders And The Fear Of The Ordinary By Donna Shute Jan. 19, 2012 In graduate school, we have this thing we call imposter syndrome  the gnawing fear that you dont really belong there, that you dont have what it takes, that you somehow slipped through the cracks in the admissions process and are actually an intellectual embarrassment, an incompetent fraud who knows jack-all about anything  and that sooner or later, like the Wizard of Oz, you will be found out and exposed for the humbug you really are. This phenomenon is one that the eating-disordered are all too familiar with. Only in our case, of course, the fear is broader and more all-encompassing: we fear we are imposters at life; that in some generalized galactic sense, we dont really belong. Moreover, we, like the tearful first-year graduate student, are horribly afraid that somewhere along the line somebody will figure this out. We are convinced in the teeth of the evidence that there is something fundamentally flawed about us, something that needs fixing and yet is unfixable. We believe ourselves a race of unique ****-ups set apart from ordinary men, and so we erect walls that make Mr. Gorbachevs look like a monument of Tinker-Toys. Ironically, the whole thing is a crude sort of megalomania: we think we are so damn special that we should be sequestered in some sort of leper colony for the unfit to live. Its miserable, sure, but its also seductive. Much has been written about how girls with eating disorders tend to be drawn from the ranks of the best and brightest. We are, if we are to believe the literature, an exceptionally savvy and intelligent bunch, abnormally intuitive and introspective, hyperaware of ourselves and our surroundings, and gifted with uncanny insight into what makes people tick. This is all unfortunately true. And it only reinforces our twisted sense of reverse-entitlement, enabling us to crow with confidence, See? I really am Different. Im a Woman of Mystery. I Have Scars. You Dont Get Me. Exit Stage Left, *******. The message we project is unmistakable: you will never understand why I am the way I am, so dont even bother. Most of us lack the impetus to recover because  although we would rather snort barbed wire than admit it  we like our self-imposed exile. We wallow in it. Its fascinating, even orgasmic. You belong in a Graham Greene novel, a friend in college once told me. Youre too fragile for real life. You belong memorialized in pen and ink where you cant do any real harm to yourself. I  perversely  insisted on taking this as a compliment, as confirmation of my Otherness, which only goes to show that at the end of the day, most of us would rather be screwed up than happy. Happy is boring. Happy is passé. Happy is for lesser mortals. Give me misery or give me death. Dont get me wrong  most of us have legitimate scars. Tolstoys famous opening to Anna Karenina  that all happy families are alike, but each unhappy one is unhappy in its own way  is equally true of the eating-disordered. No two stories are alike. Some of us were abandoned or neglected. Some of us were sexually abused. Some of us were victims of domestic violence, children of alcoholics, survivors of mental illness, or pawns in parental divorce. All of us were ravaged by relationship carnage of one kind or another. Weve trekked through hell and pushed the outer limits of what the human spirit can bear. Nobodys disputing that. Something precipitates that first momentous decision to forego dessert and starve yourself dizzy. From the moment you stick your fingers down your throat and puke till you see blood, the handwriting is on the vomit-spattered wall: something is not right. Normal people dont subject their bodies to unspeakable torture just for the hell of it. Slow suicide just isnt on their radar. They get their kicks elsewhere. So its safe to say that youve got to have more issues than National Geographic to put yourself through that kind of hell on purpose. But the trouble with scars is that eventually you start wearing them like a badge of honor. Like Hooper and Captain Quint in that scene in Jaws right before the shark shows up, you strip off your shirt and swap stories about them in a spirit of gleeful one-upmanship. You take perverse and inexplicable pride in those scars; they validate you, comfort you, prove something to yourself. You throw a gaggle of eating-disordered girls together in a room and guaranteed, the conversation will turn into a macabre game of Whose Life is the Most Messed Up, Anyway? in thirty seconds or less. Ive seen it. Ive played it. Ive won it. If you can call it winning. And the really ludicrous thing is that we think it makes us special. Those of us with eating disorders have gone to absurd lengths to distance ourselves from the ordinary run of humanity. Weve felt alone and out-of-place our entire lives; weve kicked and screamed and flailed to no avail. And so, predictably, like the kid whos run out of steam after a temper tantrum, we have given up and gone limp on the kitchen floor. If youre doomed to be alone, might as well be alone with panache. Might as well give up the fight and revel in the aloneness. But whats so funny about this whole self-fulfilling prophecy is that we arent really alone, and our methods arent really as terribly original as wed like to think they are. The statistics dont lie: there are eight million eating disorder sufferers strong in this country alone, each and every one of us absolutely convinced that we are unlike all the others, that we are somehow Extraordinary. Extraordinary. What does that even mean? Im always reminded of the Mena Suvari character in American Beauty, whose most fervent wish is to be thought extraordinary and whose most crippling fear is fear of the ordinary. In an ironic twist of fate, however, it is her very self-destructive impulses to act out and impress others with her extraordinariness that ultimately reduce her to being flat, dull, prosaic  shrinking her soul to something small and mean and ordinary. Those of us with eating disorders have known, intimately and oppressively, the fear of the ordinary. It was never enough, growing up, to be merely yourself, precious and unique, loved and lovable, unique, unrepeatable, irreducible. Nobody ever told you you were any of those things. The pressure was always on, and the external and internal compulsions to be Something, to be Great, to be Extraordinary, were both ubiquitous and unbearable. In our unceasing efforts to impress our parents, our friends, our enemies, to prove ourselves worthy of love, we got straight As, were valedictorians and salutatorians, graduated summa cum laude, danced through the hallways of academia with self-promoting narcissism masking the self-loathing lurking just beneath. We became great students, writers, actresses, singers, dancers, athletes. We lusted after elusive perfection, seeking with an insatiable and hellish desire to be the best, the brightest, the prettiest, the wittiest, the smartest, the sexiest  all embodied in being the Thinnest  whatever the cost. Eventually, we lost ourselves in the process, turning violently upon our own person, destroying our very selves in our desire to obliterate the imperfect bits. Embracing imperfection is still a near-impossible task for most of us. But its time we recognized that chasing the extraordinary is what almost killed us in the first place. What is all this extraordinary nonsense, anyway? Cosmically speaking, what kind of achievement is it to be the thinnest woman in the room? Does that really make you extraordinary? Or, like Mena Suvari in American Beauty, does it only serve to make you pathetic? If your greatest achievement in life is a weight in the two digits or the ability to shimmy into a pair of size zero-jeans  if the only impact you have made on the world when you die of cardiac arrest at age twenty-five is that they play James Taylors Fire and Rain at your funeral and everybody cries and they emblazon across your tombstone the dubious distinction She Was Thin  if the world remembers you not for the size of your heart but for the size of your waistline  then I would venture so far as to say your entire life has been in vain, has been  dare I say it  ordinary. Its time we reevaluated and redefined what it means to be extraordinary, because clearly, what weve been doing all these years isnt it. In her Pulitzer-nominated memoir Wasted, Marya Hornbacher writes, My entire identity-being was wrapped up in (1) my ability to starve and (2) my intellect. I had a complete identity crisis when I realized neither of these was impressing anyone. I think many of us have undergone a similar crisis in the long, slow, painful process of recovery, but its about time we understood, like Marya Hornbacher eventually came to realize in treatment, that we are actually good at something other than starving and puking, that, in her words: It was entirely unoriginal to be starving to death. Everyone was doing it. It was, as a friend would later put it, totally passé. Totally 1980s. I decided to be something slightly less Vogue. So be a real rugged individualist. Do something really innovative and cutting-edge. Try something really extraordinary. Stop hating yourself. Love God. Love yourself. Love other people. Be happy. Im not extraordinary, and Ive nearly killed myself trying to be  but what I am is perfectly imperfect. Thats what I have to offer this world  and thats fine by me 
 Eating Disorders Can Last Well Beyond Teen Years By Dennis Thompson, HealthDay December 28, 2011 Experts are finding that adult stresses often trigger lingering problems. Eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia are typically thought to be diseases of young women and men. But researchers are finding that the personal demons that drive a young person to an eating disorder may linger into adulthood. More and more middle-aged and older people are coming forward to receive treatment for eating problems that began in their youth and have been reignited by adult stress or personal crises. "Some had actual eating disorders" when they were younger, and "others had aspects of an eating disorder but were never fully treated," said Dr. Ed Tyson, an eating disorders specialist in Austin, Texas. "Then something happens later in life that stresses them to a point where the eating disorder becomes engaged." The Renfrew Center, which operates a number of eating disorder clinics in the United States, has seen a 42 percent increase in middle-aged female clients since 2001, said Holly Grishkat, senior director of clinical operations for the center's northeast region. Unhealthy eating patterns adopted in adolescence or teen years often continue into adulthood, according to a University of Minnesota study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association. The study, which followed 2,287 kids as they grew into young adults, found that more than half of the girls had unhealthy eating patterns that continued into their mid- to late 20s. That was the case with Alison Smela, 49, who lives in the Chicago area. When she was 12, she was given a weight plan to follow over the summer because she was considered overweight. Smela said she went back to school thinner, and people noticed approvingly. "I got all kinds of attention, and I liked that," she said. "I equated losing weight with gaining attention." Controlling her eating also helped Smela feel better when things seemed too much to handle. "When life got tough, I always knew I could control the scale," she said. But as she grew more successful and climbed the corporate ladder, her anorexia spiraled out of control. So did her problem with heavy drinking. "The more pressure I was under, the more titles I had, I wasn't dealing with the pressures of the job and of life in a healthy manner," she said. Tyson said that eating disorders can be very devastating to the bodies at middle-age, when osteoporosis, chemical imbalances and other health issues crop up more easily and have an even more lasting impact on health. "Older bodies do not have the plasticity that younger bodies do," he explained. "They can't tolerate the stresses and risks." When Smela turned 40, she said, she decided to receive treatment for her alcoholism. She's now nearly a decade sober. But her eating disorder remained untreated, even though she knew she had a problem. "I presumed alcoholism was more acceptable to society at my age," she said. "Having an eating disorder wasn't." That's not an uncommon perception for middle-aged people with an eating disorder, Tyson said. "They feel more peculiar because they're older," he said. "They think this is something for younger people, not for them. There's some shame associated with it." Diane Butrym, 50, of Schenectady, N.Y., said such concerns are justified but must be surmounted. When Butrym went to the Renfrew Center for treatment eight years ago, she said, she found herself uncomfortable in the presence of the younger women struggling with the same problem she had. "One of the parents said, 'Aren't you a little too old to be going through this?'" recalled Butrym, who still struggles with her eating disorder. "That was very embarrassing for me. It was really hard to overcome that." The specific problems faced by middle-aged people with eating disorders prompted the Renfrew Center to create a separate treatment program specifically tailored to their needs, Grishkat said. "The older women tend to mother the younger women and take care of the younger women in the group rather than taking care of themselves," Grishkat said. "The other thing we've noticed, the older women have a tendency to sit back and not say anything because they're ashamed. They feel like they should be the role models for the younger women." What drives someone in midlife to seek help for an eating disorder varies. For Smela, who was 46 at the time she first went to the Renfrew Center, it was her reflection, she said. "The summer before I went for treatment, I started catching glimpses of myself in a mirror or reflection, and I was scared," she said. "I saw my body as a whole, and it scared me." But no matter what age they are, people who feel they have an eating disorder need to seek help, Grishkat and Tyson said. Talk to a doctor, contact the Renfrew Center or similar facility or reach out to the National Eating Disorders Association, the two experts suggested. Treatment is particularly vital if the person has children, even if treatment will temporarily take them away from their responsibilities at home, Tyson said. "Having an eating disorder makes their children have a 12- to 15-fold greater risk of having an eating disorder," he said. "They need to do the work and get better, or their children could be at risk." More information The National Eating Disorders Association has more on eating disorders.

 When eating disorders turn to non-food objects: what is pica and how serious are its consequences? by Kate Daigle September 16, 2011 Pica is one of the least known eating disorders because of its bizarre nature and its relatively new arrival on the eating disorder scene. What is pica? A person afflicted with pica has a persistent craving for a substance that is not commonly considered food. These substances are largely non-nutritive (clay, laundry detergent, coal, chalk, sand, gum, tacks, and other office supplies) and ingesting them can be very medically dangerous. To be considered pica, the symptoms must persist for more than one month and must occur at a time when it is not developmentally appropriate (usually at ages older than 18 months). Pica most commonly occurs in children and pregnant women, and it is seen in many animals, particularly dogs. The disorder can show up in children and adults with developmental difficulties such as autism or Downs Syndrome. The word pica originated from the Latin word for magpie, which are birds that are known to eat just about anything. Why does pica impact pregnant women? Clinicians and doctors think that craving a substance that is not food may be an indicator that the woman is dealing with a vitamin or nutrient deficiency such as low calcium or iron, and this can typically happen in families that live in poverty. Pica usually goes away after childbirth in theses cases, but can also continue into the post-partum period. In some cultures, the eating of non-food substances is traditionally accepted and practiced. However, pica is spreading to Western cultures that do not have such traditions and it can cause serious medical conditions (especially in pregnant women) such as: AnemiaConstipationIntestinal infections or parasites from soilIntestinal obstructionLead poisoning  especially in childrenLiver and kidney damageMalnutritionMercury poisoningSo is pica considered to be an eating disorder? It is not currently listed in the diagnostic manual (DSM), but is being considered for future inclusion. Eating substances that are not food can be a way of managing both weight and emotional issues. Someone suffering from anorexia may eat clay or plastic in an attempt to stave off extreme hunger and not gain weight. Others may eat a substance that helps them to avoid painful feelings because of the intensity of the taste of what they are eating. Sometimes, eating a substance might bring back memories of a good time or of a loved one who has passed away and this can be the persons way of connecting with those feelings. Some professionals feel that pica is more associated with sensory processing or feeding disorders and not eating disorders. The lines can be blurry. What is common between eating disorder and pica are the severe medical concerns that can occur as a result of the eating or restricting of substances. Consuming substances (whether it is ingestible or not) can alter the way that your brain functions and can affect the persons emotional state. Eating a painful or dangerous substance can be a way of avoiding, of self-punishing, or of getting pleasure in a non-traditional way. I consider pica to be an eating disorder because it involves consuming substance in a way that is not normal or healthy. This is common with other types of eating disorders. What causes pica? While professionals are still not sure the exact cause, pica can be influenced by malnutrition, poverty, emotional deprivation, anemia, neglect, lack of parental supervision or parental abuse, or developmental delays. Consulting a medical doctor as well as working with a therapist are essential in recovery from pica. Many people with this condition need to be medically stabilized and ensure that there is no internal damage before he or she can begin working on the emotional consequences and causes of the disorder. It is also very important to try to prevent this issue turning into another type of eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia. If self-esteem is an issue for the person, he or she may have a belief that they do not deserve to eat real foods. I find it essential to strive for awareness about any type of mental disorder that may affect those that we know, love, and treat. The more we know, the more we can help to relieve emotional and physical pain. A condition such as pica, though relatively rare, possess behaviors that are so abnormal for our development that it forces us to take note. In some cases, engaging in serious pica behaviors is a way of self-harm and potential bodily failure. If you or someone you know may show symptoms of pica, consult a medical professional immediately. 
 Celebrities Speak Out Against Eating Disorders by Meg Quinlan Sept. 1, 2011 Body image can be as important to teens as who their friends are. Girls and boys alike can be teased or bullied by others for a variety of reasons, however if a teen feels comfortable in their own skin, the likelihood of them allowing the bullying to hurt them is less likely. Many teens turn to the celebrities  they look at the pencil thin girls, the guys with six pack abs and hopefully realize most of this is simply Hollywood or photo-shop! Whether they wish for it or not, celebrities are role models. Fans follow them in their work, consume the media that examines their lives, and discuss them online and in real life. Their bad behavior is widely publicized, but what about those that are making a positive difference? These stars, all themselves survivors of eating disorders, are speaking out about their own battle and helping to raise awareness about this serious medical problem. They are making a difference, and are part of the solution to the shame and secrecy preventing many victims of eating disorders from seeking help. Here are their stories. Actress Jamie-Lynn Sigler was a typical overachiever. Bright and talented, she filled her schedule with school, acting, student council, teaching kids and studying for the SATs. During her junior year, after a painful breakup with a boyfriend, she began to focus on losing weight. She says all of a sudden, I felt like everything in my life was getting out of control, and here was one thing I could control. She adopted a strict regimen of diet and exercise typical of those with exercise bulimia, her particular eating disorder. Her obsession changed and isolated her: physically, she withered to a skeleton; formerly a social butterfly, she now avoided going out with friends and exercised instead for hours; and she wrote down everything she ate, when she ate it, and when she exercised. She recalls that one day her mother hugged her, then burst into tears because she could feel all of Jamies bones. Her turning point came when she realized how unhappy her life had become, and she began five months of therapy to rebuild her confidence and her body. Now author of a book called Wise Girl  What Ive Learned About Life, Love, and Loss and honored by the National Eating Disorder Association for her work on their behalf, she is resolute but realistic. She says, The eating disorder is always going to be with me. But what I went through was traumatic enough and enough of a learning experience that I would never fall so deeply again. Im so much happier now. Singer and Disney actress Demi Lovato has been in the news recently, speaking out about her eating disorder and treatment. Bullied in school, she started compulsively overeating at age 8 and soon had anorexia, which by her teenage years had escalated to include self-harm, depression, and bulimia. At 18 years old, her family and management team had an intervention, and she entered a residential treatment center. There she learned healthy ways to cope with her feelings, and resolved to set a good example for her little sister and her young fans that may be dealing with the same issues. Today she considers herself still recovering, and tries to be realistic about her progress, saying Im going to mess up, and Im not going to be perfect, but as long as I try every day to get better and better myself, then Im one step ahead of where I was before. She now is working with Seventeen Magazine and the Love is Louder campaign for at-risk girls, and is a spokesperson for Teens Against Bullying. Dancer, singer, and American Idol judge Paula Abdul began purging in high school, as a way to control her weight in the competitive and body-conscious world of dance. She describes her young self as a perfectionist and an overachiever, and as top honor student, class president and head cheerleader, it looked like she had it all. Yet at only 52, she felt she was at a disadvantage against her fellow cheerleaders and dancers. She describes her bulimia as a war on my body. Me and my body have been on two separate sides. She continued this war during her rise to stardom as an L.A. Lakers cheerleader, choreographer, and then singer. After a painful divorce in 1994, she finally came to terms with her eating disorder and checked herself into treatment. Then ashamed, she tried to keep it a secret. Now, she is a spokesperson for the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) and says Im more proud of my recovery than of selling millions of records. Aussie rocker Daniel Johns of Silverchair and the Dissociatives began restricting his eating in his teens in an attempt to look ill. He was defying convention at school, wearing makeup and playing in a band, and was getting beaten up by bullies and called gay slurs. As for looking ill and deterring his bullies, unfortunately it worked, he says, because then I was addicted to it and couldnt start eating again. Convincing himself that food was poisoned, he wouldnt go to restaurants, and couldnt bear the smell, look, or even to be around a discussion of food. He explains that his disorder had nothing to do with body image, and everything to do with a desire for control. Every timeI felt that my life was out of controlI took control of food intake, because it was the only thing that no one could really take charge of. He realized how much control he had actually lost when more than one doctor told him he was dying. Anti-depressant medications, along with the support of the people around him and his music, helped free him from the addiction that threatened his life. Later, like many who talk publicly about their addictions, he was criticized for self-promotion, which he dismissed. When you get letters that say, Youve helped me admit to anorexia, and I was gonna kill myself until I heard this album, that makes people that say, Youre exploiting your problems, just seem like such a little speck in the dirt. Actress Elisa Donovan was never overweight, but that fact didnt stop her from increasingly restrictive dieting. She says she thought the more weight she lost, the happier she would be, yet she would only see specific body parts that she thought looked enormous. She continued to lose weight until her friends started to express their concern, her hair fell out in clumps, and she fainted several times. After being hospitalized, she finally sought treatment and realized how her disorder had restricted her life-she would never go out for lunch or dinner, and as she says, I was so unhappy with myself, I didnt answer my phone. Speaking out has helped her, as has the desire to be a healthy role model. She advises, There is no connection between the shape of your body and whether you can succeed, or whether youre a smart person or a good person. Shame and isolation are still barriers that prevent many victims from seeking help. Every survivor of this illness can help others by speaking out, even if they arent followed by thousands of fans.

 Therapist Carolyn Costin on the Eight Keys to Eating Disorder Recovery by Nancy Matsumoto, Psychology Today August 21, 2011 An upcoming book, distills eating disorders recovery to 8 key steps One of our most insightful eating disorders experts, Carolyn Costin, has a new book coming out in November called 8 Keys to Recovery From an Eating Disorder (W.W. Norton & Company). Costin is a therapist, author, and founder of the residential treatment facility Monte Nido in Malibu, CA. She and co-author Gwen Schubert Grabb have both recovered from an eating disorder; Grabb is a former patient of Costin's who is now a therapist herself. This accessible self-help guide actively engages readers with writing assignments (examples include describing your worst eating-disordered day, visualizing in detail a day in your future life when you are recovered, and "talking back" to your eating disorder self) that challenge them to look within and fashion their own recovery. It's worth noting, that just as Marcia described her own belief in the possibility of full recovery from an eating disorder in our book, and Aimee Liu does the same in her latest book, Costin and Grabb are also firm believers in total recovery. Here's Costin's description: "Being recovered is when a person can accept his or her natural body size and shape and no longer has a self-destructive relationship with food or exercise. When you are recovered, food and weight take a proper perspective in your life, and what you weigh is not more important than who you are; in fact, actual numbers are of little or no importance at all. When recovered, you will not compromise your health or betray your soul to look a certain way, wear a certain size, or reach a certain number on a scale. When you are recovered you do not use eating disorder behaviors to deal with, distract from, or cope with other problems." The eight keys are:Motivation, patience, and hopeYour healthy self will heal your eating disordered selfIt's not about the foodFeel your feelings, challenge your thoughtsIt is about the foodChanging your behaviorsReach out to people rather than your eating disorderFinding meaning and purpose In the second key, the authors write about the "eating disorder self," explaining, "the goal is not to get rid of your eating disorder self, but to learn from it, discover what it is doing for you, and then strengthen your healthy self to take over its job." Throughout, the authors share stories from their own recoveries to help guide readers through the difficult twists and turns on their own road back to health. On the divisive subject of food addiction, the authors write, "There is no proof that binge-eating disorder, bulimia, or anorexia, which is essentially food refusal, are illnesses caused by any certain food or food addiction. They note that 12-step approaches were first applied to help compulsive overeaters (now referred to as binge eaters) abstain from binge foods, then later adapted to anorexia and bulimia. Costin and Grabb like many of the support mechanisms that such groups provide. But they believe that rather than trying to abstain from certain foods, readers' time would be better spent working on improving behaviors such as bingeing or restricting. They offer a well-reasoned set of guidelines on how to adapt the 12-step model to eating disorders recovery. I especially liked Costin and Grabb's description of how eating-disordered behavior can start as a way to numb certain feelings or enhance others, and then eventually become an end unto themselves. By stopping these automatic behaviors, they explain, you can begin to feel actual feelings again and work on developing better ways to experience, process, learn from and cope with them. In Key 5, the authors acknowledge that recovery means changing your relationship to food, whether it is too rigid or overly chaotic. By Key 7, readers are likely to be ready to engage in reaching out to others rather than their eating disorder in times of stress or need. "Getting better feels bad," at least at first, Coston and Grabb explain, so "You need support." The last key focuses on moving beyond superficial concerns over how flat your belly is to more spiritually nourishing activities, and advises "bringing meaning to your life through feeding your soul," whether it is through "telling truth without judgment", mindfulness, meditation, or building an altar.

 It's About Time We Looked at Male Eating Disorders by Nancy Matsumoto, Psychology Today July 16, 2011 Pulling the curtain away from male eating disorders A recent report from Britain's National Health Service announced a 66 percent rise in hospital admissions for men with eating disorders over the last 10 years. This did not come as shocking news to me since for years now, experts in the field have been warning us about the rise in male eating disorders. Some estimate that as many as one quarter of eating disorder sufferers are male, but even that figure may be outdated by now. The stigma toward female eating disorders is slowly lifting as we learn more about the genetic basis for these psychiatric disorders, causes that have nothing to do with lack of willpower, laziness, or general moral failure. More people, including general practitioners, educators, coaches, and parents, realize that these are serious illness that can kill, and must be treated as such. Yet the male eating disorder is still largely taboo. Men and boys are more afraid to come forward, and thus far fewer men end up in treatment. That means they don't show up in hospitalization statistics. Happily, this latest report indicates things may be changing, at least in Britain. All the factors that have been cited for this high incidence are true: men are judged on appearances as much as women today. A poor economy and increasing financial pressures make men (just as women) feel they have to look younger, fitter, to compete in the job market. Often the disorder starts with an effort to get fit, the exercising spirals out of control, becoming obsessive. Restricting food intake can quickly become pathological in a genetically susceptible individual and very soon, you have a full-blown eating disorder on your hands. Doctors don't look for male eating disorders as much as female eating disorders, and again, men aren't coming forward as much to seek treatment. Part of the problem has been that men by nature (if I may make a completely broad generalization here) tend to be less comfortable discussing feelings of any sort: insecurity, anxiety, depression, loneliness, all of which are moods that can underlie and complicate an eating disorder. Often the defenses erected against those feelings preclude any recognition of them, which makes discussing them or seeking help for them impossible to do. I recall one (male) doctor who specialized in eating disorders among men talking about sitting in a room with a patient who was so completely in emotional pain yet struggled for insight as to how he ended up there. Another memory that pops up is the story of the former lacrosse star-turned eating disorders advocate Patrick Bergstrom, whom I interviewed for this National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) toolkit on athletes and eating disorders. It was hard to hear his devastating story of going from golden boy athlete who could do no wrong to the desperate young man who ate less than a meal a day, drank to excess, fainted periodically and couldn't hold a job. A month before his wedding day, Bergstrom found himself lying on the ground, crying out for help. Two weeks later he was finally diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, and entered an eating disorders treatment center. In an account of his illness Bergstrom wrote, "I was also still in complete denial because of the shame and stigma put on those that suffer from eating disorders. I thought I was the only guy dealing with body image issues, depression, substance abuse, and an eating disorder. Since being in strong recovery, I have learned that so many males struggle with these exact issues and have very similar stories to mine." (For a fuller version of Patrick's story, click here.) I hope that the recent headlines will encourage men and boys who are suffering in secret to seek treatment. A good place to start, for those who don't know where to turn, is the NEDA Information & Referral Helpline: (800) 931 2237.

 Orthorexia: Where Eating Disorders Meet OCD OCD Center of Los Angeles Tuesday, July 12th, 2011 Orthorexia  The Not-So-Healthy Obsession with Healthy Eating Individuals suffering with Orthorexia exhibit symptoms similar to those of OCD and Eating Disorders. Orthorexia Nervosa (also simply known as Orthorexia) is a relatively new term within the psychological and medical fields. Simply defined, Orthorexia is an eating disorder in which an individual has an excessive and ultimately unhealthy obsession about maintaining a diet that is totally healthy and pure. Because of their extremely restrictive eating, individuals with Orthorexia are often severely underweight, and frequently lack the proper nourishment to perform basic daily activities. Like most cases involving an eating disorder, the outcome of Orthorexia can be severe malnutrition and a significant reduction of ones quality of life. Orthorexia has not yet been accepted as a formal diagnosis by the psychiatric community, and has not been defined within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV). However, since first being described by Dr. Steven Bratman in 1996, many health professionals have observed the often debilitating results of this condition. Symptoms of Orthorexia Like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Orthorexia can be conceptualized as a constellation of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. The most prominent obsession seen in Orthorexia is an excessive concern about the healthfulness of food. Those with Orthorexia often spend many hours of the day planning and obsessing about what foods they have eaten or will eat, the nutritional content of that food, and how that food has been grown, processed, and/or prepared. Individuals with Orthorexia may obsess about any number of nutritional aspects of food, including, but not limited to the following: CaloriesSugar (especially refined sugar)High fructose corn syrupFatHydrogenated or partially hydrogenated fat (trans fats)ProteinCarbohydratesGlycemic indexSalt / sodiumFiberGlutenDairy productsFatty acidsVitamin and mineral content of the foodWhether or not a food is whole or organicWhether or not a food is sufficiently vegan, vegetarian, or macrobioticWhether or not a food is genetically modifiedThe most obvious behavioral symptom of Orthorexia is the compulsive avoidance of foods that the sufferer deems unhealthy or impure. Individuals with Orthorexia may at first simply eliminate a few specific foods from their diet, but over time, their diets often become more and more restrictive. Eventually, they may eat only a select small number of foods that have been prepared in a manner that they have decided is correct or pure. At the same time, they may also purchase many expensive, natural or organic health food products and supplements that they perceive as more pure and/or healthy than traditional foods. In addition to food avoidance, individuals with Orthorexia will often spend excessive amounts of time researching food issues related to the above concerns. This research may include many hours of internet searching, buying and reading an excessive amount of food, health, and nutrition related books, and near-constant examination of food labels when shopping for groceries at the market. For individuals with Orthorexia, the obsessive concern with what goes into their bodies may also extend to other, non-food related health issues. Often, they have a disproportionate level of fear related to the possibility of exposure to what they perceive as pathogens in everyday products and in the environment. This may result in compulsive avoidance of certain soaps, shampoos, perfumes, and deodorants, as well as x-rays, vaccinations, or even mercury in dental fillings. They may broadly reject much of western medical science in favor of homeopathy, osteopathy, and other complementary and alternative medicine approaches. It is also common for those with Orthorexia to spend much of their social time discussing food, and attempting to convince others of the correct way to eat. This may result in conflict with families and friends who do not agree with their views, and who take offense when the person with Orthorexia repeatedly criticizes their food choices. Likewise, those with Orthorexia may take offense when friends and family express their concerns about the health and dietary choices of the sufferer. On a more internal, psychological level, those suffering with Orthorexia often experience significant guilt and shame when they do not maintain their purist dietary rules. They are usually extremely strict with themselves about their diet and their overall health, and are often overly judgmental towards themselves and their ability to control what they eat. Frequently, much of their self-esteem and sense of identity is rooted in their diet and in their success in satisfying their high levels of self-discipline. Diagnosis and Relationship to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder While some see Orthorexia as an eating disorder, many mental health experts agree that it is best conceptualized as a hybrid of an eating disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Like OCD, Orthorexia is defined by the individuals obsessive thoughts (in this case, thoughts about certain foods being dangerously unhealthy), and the compulsive behaviors done in an effort to minimize the anxiety caused by those obsessive thoughts (in this case, food avoidance, as well as the other behaviors noted above). The food avoidance seen in Orthorexia also has an obvious relationship to Anorexia. In fact, many with Orthorexia are eventually diagnosed with Anorexia as a result of weight loss related to their food avoidance. And some mental health clinicians see Orthorexia as a behavioral symptom of Anorexia in which the individual uses the issue of healthfulness as a justification for not eating. It is also worth noting that some with Orthorexia will resort to purging behaviors similar to those seen in Bulimia in an effort to rid their bodies of impurities that they believe they may have ingested. Purging behaviors may include vomiting, use of laxatives and emetics, and use of colon cleansers to rid themselves of alleged toxins. Likewise, similar to those with Anorexia and Bulimia, individuals with Orthorexia often perform other compensatory behaviors such as compulsive exercising in an effort to make their bodies as perfect and pure as possible. Symptoms of Orthorexia also overlap with those of other Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum Disorders. The excessive focus on healthfulness leads many to develop a distorted over-concern with their actual health, not unlike those with Hypochondria (also known as Health Anxiety). Likewise, many with Orthorexia have a distorted body image, much like those with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). Because of the extreme restrictions commonly seen in this condition, it is often very difficult for those with Orthorexia to eat socially, or even be in social places at all. As result of trying to avoid being confronted about their food obsession, many with Orthorexia develop a pattern of social avoidance similar to that of Social Anxiety. The result is often a reduction in social interaction, and in some cases, a complete severing of friendships and relationships in order to maintain and protect their diet. Finally, it is worth noting the overlap between phobias and Orthorexia. The two primary distinguishing features of phobias are the sufferers irrational fear of a specific object or event, and their subsequent efforts to avoid exposure to that object or event. Some conceptualize Orthorexia as essentially being a food phobia, in which the individual is terrified of being exposed to foods that they irrationally see as imminent threats to their well-being. Part two of this series will examine the treatment of Orthorexia utilizing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Kimberley Quinlan, MA, is a psychotherapist at the the OCD Center of Los Angeles, a private, outpatient clinic specializing in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for the treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and related conditions, including Orthorexia. 
 Eating disorders stalk women into adulthood By Linda Carroll, TODAY.com July 6, 2011 Center reports 42 percent increase in women over 35 seeking treatment What finally washed away Kari Adamss denial was the flood of tears streaming down her dads face. Frightened by Karis plunging weight, her family had been begging the 41-year-old mother of two to seek help for months. But nobody could convince Kari that anything was wrong  until she saw her dads tears. Thats when it hit me, she said. He never cried before in my whole life. Karis story echoes that of many other middle-aged women in America. Major transitions and traumatic mid-life events  crumbling marriages, job losses or kids going off to college  can rekindle eating disorders that had begun years before. Its rare that an eating disorder shows up completely out of the blue in mid-life, said Douglas Bunnell, vice president and director of out-patient clinical services at The Renfrew Center, where Kari eventually sought help. The more common scenario, Bunnell said, is the resurgence of a life-long problem. Eating disorder experts are seeing more and more patients like Kari these days. The Renfrew Center has seen a 42 percent increase in the number of women over the age of 35 seeking help. Thats prompted the center to come up with a special program geared to their older patients. Therapists focus on stressors that trigger eating disorders in adults and on the underlying issues inflaming the problem, such as anxiety. For these people, theres something soothing about not eating, Bunnell said. The eating disorder has become embedded in the way they manage anxiety. Though Kari had struggled with anorexia when she was younger, shed been eating normally for years. But when her husband left, her disordered eating patterns came roaring back. I went into fear mode, she explained to TODAY.com. And the disorder took over. It told me I had to be a size zero. I had to stay in these jeans. New research is showing that people tend not to outgrow eating disorders. A study published in Julys issue of the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that unhealthy eating patterns that start in childhood or teen years can spill over, sometimes even intensifying, as people get older. Data from the 10-year study that followed 2,287 teens through early adulthood showed a sharp increase with age  8.4 percent to 20.4 percent  in the number of young women resorting to extreme measures to control their weight. The results come as no surprise to David Sarwer, an associate professor of psychology and director of clinical services at the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. A lot of adult patients who eventually present with eating disorders have been struggling throughout adolescence and early adulthood, he said. They may have always been lean and very careful about what they ate. Then there is some major stressor that becomes a tipping point and this kind of sub-clinical disorder becomes full-blown. Karis unhappy and unhealthy relationship with food began early in life. She distinctly remembers when she began to obsess about her weight. She was just 5 and sitting on her great-grandmothers lap. After grabbing hold of little Karis belly baby fat, her great-grandmother intoned, Oh boy, look at your tummy. Youre going to have to go on a diet. Kari was stricken. I remember the panic I felt, she said. I thought, Im going to have to go on a diet because Im not good enough the way I am. Thirty-five years later, when Karis family finally convinced her to seek help, her anorexia had taken a toll on her health. I was losing hair, she told NBCs Dr. Nancy Snyderman. My gums were bleeding. I had broken bones. I had lost my period for three years. But all those symptoms seemed so insignificant at the time. I didnt care, she told Snyderman. What mattered was the scale. Eating disorders for many women are about control. As they see other areas of their lives spin into chaos, they turn their focus to food. Controlling what goes in your mouth is the last line of defense any of us have, Sarwer said. We can be told what to do and what to think. We can be pressured in all sorts of ways. But we decide what, if anything, crosses our lips. The time at Renfrew is starting to pay off for Kari. Shes gained some weight and is now beginning to feel happy with the way she looks. Her advice to other women is that you have to be comfortable in your own skin and ignore the voices screaming in your head that you must be skeletal thin. It never gets better, she said. It only gets worse. Youll never reach a number you can be happy with. Youll never look in the mirror and be happy with what you see. But there is hope, Kari said, for women with eating disorders  no matter what their age. Recovery is possible, she said, and it is so much better than living with the disease. Linda Carroll is a health and science writer living in New Jersey. Her work has appeared in The New York Times, Newsday, Health magazine and SmartMoney. She is co-author of the forthcoming book, The Concussion Crisis: Anatomy of a Silent Epidemic. 
 Talking to a Loved One with an Eating Disorder by Leora Fulvio, RECOVER July 6, 2011 Watching someone that you love being active in their eating disorder is devastating. Its so painful to watch your mother, sister, wife or girlfriend (or husband, father, brother or son) either restrict their food, or binge on foods that are unhealthy for them, or to know that theyre purging in the bathroom after theyve eaten. Its painful and upsetting and scary. You might find yourself becoming very angry at the person whom you love when you see them taking such poor care of themselves. Its important to find compassion for the person who has the eating disorder when you choose to talk to them about it. Although you might feel angry, please try to understand that this is a serious problem that she/he has. They would certainly stop if they could.When you talk to them, dont be attacking. If you come at the person and say things like, you really need to be eating more, or you have to take better care of yourself, or I want you to stop purging now, youre going to create a face off and a defensive stance. The person is going to be forced to defend themselves against this attack. Instead, talk to them using I statements. For example: I have noticed lately that you look very, very thin, and Im worried. I havent seen you eat at all in several weeks. Its really hard for me to watch this because I love you so much and Im terrified that Im going to lose you. I just dont know what I would do without you. Is there anything I can do to support you? Would you be willing to do some family counseling with me with an eating disorder specialist? Or can we go see a nutritionist together and perhaps I can help you go shopping? I just really love you and want you to be healthy. Really contact your own feelings of fear rather than anger in order to get a conversation going.Dont try to fix the person. Dont try to take food away from them or force food on them. Dont refuse to eat if theyre not eating. Dont make comments about what they are or are not eating.Dont be afraid to talk openly and honestly about how their eating is affecting you.Remember that this is a very hard topic and the person who you confront will most likely feel embarrassed and ashamed. You dont want to shame them into recovery. In fact, this can often backfire. Let them know how much you love them and want to be there for them and youre not going to let them go through this alone.Understand that recovery takes time, dont expect them to see a therapist once and then all of a sudden to be cured. Be patient and if you can, try to be an active participant in their recovery.If this person is completely unreceptive to you, dont push or get angry. Get help for yourself. You need support when you love someone with an active eating disorder. You might want to check out Al-anon or Codependents Anonymous or seek therapy or a support group for family members of people with EDs.Even though you might feel angry and frustrated (thats so normal) dont give up on someone you love. Let them know that you love them and you will be there for them when they are ready.Recovery from eating disorders is hard. But watching someone struggle is downright painful. You feel helpless and scared and depressed. Please try to get love and support for yourself as well. Some further reading and resources: :: IndexPerfect Illusions .

 Eating disorder treatment: Know your options Mayo Clinic Aug. 18, 2009 Treatments for eating disorders include medications, counseling and education. Find out what works. Eating disorder treatment depends on the disorder and the severity of your symptoms. Getting the right eating disorder treatment for a condition such as anorexia, bulimia or binge-eating disorder is essential to prevent it from worsening or causing serious health problems. Eating disorder treatment generally involves a team of health professionals, and includes psychotherapy, nutrition education, and sometimes medication. In many cases, eating disorder treatment also involves treating other health problems linked to an eating disorder. If an eating disorder doesn't improve with standard treatment or causes medical problems, hospitalization may be necessary. Although overcoming an eating disorder can be challenging, having an organized approach to eating disorder treatment can help you manage symptoms, regain a healthy weight, and maintain your physical and mental health. Forming a treatment team A treatment team may include: You and family members involved in your treatmentA medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental illness (psychiatrist)A dietitian to provide nutritional counselingA psychologist or other psychotherapistYour primary care doctor and other doctors involved with your careA social worker or social workers It's best if everyone on the treatment team communicates on a regular basis about your progress so that adjustments can be made to your treatment as needed. Involving your partner, parents or other family members is important. For young people still living at home, a family meeting may be needed to determine who will be involved in supervising food intake and how information will be provided to the treatment team. Managing an eating disorder can be a long-term challenge. You may need to continue to see your doctor, dietitian, mental health provider or other members of your treatment team on a regular basis even if your eating disorder and related health problems are under control. Setting up a treatment plan At the beginning of your treatment, you and your treatment team will come up with goals and guidelines. This will make it clear what to do if you're not able to stick with your plan or you're having health problems related to your eating disorder. A treatment plan may be particularly important if your eating disorder could impact your mental or physical health enough that you need to go to the hospital. Your treatment team will consider what your needs are and what resources are available in your area. Cost of certain treatment programs also may be a factor. Hospitalization and outpatient programs for treating eating disorders can be expensive, and insurance may not cover all of the costs of your care. Psychotherapy for an eating disorder Psychological counseling (psychotherapy) is generally the most important eating disorder treatment. It involves seeing a psychologist, psychiatrist or other mental health counselor on a regular basis. Psychotherapy can help you: Exchange unhealthy habits for healthy onesMonitor your treatment goalsDevelop problem-solving skillsLearn how to cope with stressful situationsImprove your relationships with othersImprove your mood Counseling may last from a few months to several years. A number of different methods of counseling are used to treat eating disorders. They include: Cognitive behavioral therapy. This type of counseling is a short-term, structured treatment that helps you address the thoughts, feelings and behaviors related to your eating disorder. Its goals may include helping you unlearn distorted thinking, regaining normal eating habits and stopping purging.Interpersonal psychotherapy. Another short-term treatment, interpersonal psychotherapy focuses on resolving relationship issues that contribute to your eating disorder. This type of treatment may be especially helpful if you have depression along with an eating disorder.Psychodynamic treatment. The aim of this counseling approach is to help you reduce unhealthy behavior by resolving underlying problems linked to your eating disorder. This type of treatment can take longer than other types of psychotherapy because it involves exploring your feelings and beliefs in depth.Family therapy. Involving family members in counseling may be especially helpful in younger people who have anorexia.Group psychotherapy. This type of counseling involves meeting with a mental health counselor along with who struggle with eating disorders. Treatment may involve a combination of types of counseling. Your psychologist or counselor may ask you to do homework, such as keep a food journal to review in counseling sessions, identify triggers that cause you to binge, purge or engage in other unhealthy eating behavior, and eat scheduled meals and snacks. Nutrition education Dietitians and other providers on your treatment team can help you better understand your eating disorder and nutrition, and help you develop a plan to maintain healthy eating habits. Goals of nutrition education generally include: Education about how nutrition affects your bodyMeal planningEstablishing regular eating patterns  generally, three meals a day with regular snacksTaking steps to avoid dieting Nutrition education may involve cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to help you recognize faulty beliefs and thought patterns and understand how your eating disorder causes nutrition issues and physical problems. Medications for eating disorders Medications may help you follow your treatment plan. They're most effective when combined with psychological counseling. Medications used to treat eating disorders include: Antidepressants. Taking an antidepressant may be especially helpful if you have anorexia along with depression, anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder. An antidepressant may also help if you're having a hard time sticking with your treatment plan.Anti-anxiety medications. Taking an anti-anxiety medication may help you stick to treatment and maintain a plan to eat a certain number of calories each day.Antipsychotic medications. Your doctor may prescribe an antipsychotic for anorexia if you are very underweight, you have severe anxiety, you have a severe inability to eat or if other medications don't help. Hospitalization for eating disorders Hospitalization may be necessary if you have serious physical or mental health problems or if you have anorexia and are unable to eat or gain weight. Severe or life-threatening physical health problems that occur with anorexia can be a medical emergency. In many cases, the most important goal of hospitalization is to get back to a healthy weight. Achieving your ideal weight can take months, so you'll probably need to continue outpatient treatment to accomplish your goals once you get out of the hospital. Hospital day treatment programs Day treatment programs are structured programs that generally require attendance for three to eight hours a day. Day treatment can include medical care, group, individual and family counseling, structured eating sessions, and nutrition counseling. You may still be able to work or attend school if you're in a day treatment program. Residential treatment for eating disorders With residential treatment, you live at an eating disorder treatment facility. A residential treatment program may be necessary if you need long term care for your eating disorder or you've been in the hospital a number of times but your mental or physical health hasn't improved. Ongoing treatment for health problems Eating disorders can cause serious health problems related to inadequate nutrition, overeating, bingeing and other factors. The type of health problems caused by eating disorders depends on the particular type of eating disorder and its severity. In many cases, problems caused by an eating disorder require ongoing treatment and monitoring. Health problems linked to eating disorders can include: Electrolyte imbalances, which can interfere with the functioning of your muscles, heart and nervesHeart problemsDigestive problemsNutrient deficienciesDental cavities and erosion of the surface of your teeth from frequent vomiting (bulimia)Low bone density (osteoporosis) as a result of long-term malnutrition (anorexia)Stunted growth caused by poor nutrition (anorexia)Mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder Getting informed and taking an active role You are the most important member of your treatment team. In order for your treatment to be a success, you need to be actively involved with your treatment and informed about your eating disorder, and so do your family members. Your psychiatrist or other members of your treatment team can provide education and tell you where to find information and support. It's a good idea to search for resources on your own as well. Resources that can help you understand and cope with your eating disorder include: BooksSelf-help workbooksCommunity resources such as support groupsInternet resources such as nonprofit organizations and online support groups References Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with eating disorders.

 15 Alarming Facts About Eating Disorders in College by Sue Scheff July 1, 2011 Eating disorders especially end up on the receiving end of frequent stereotyping and misunderstanding  a very dangerous phenomenon, considering how they can quickly turn fatal when left unchecked. College students comprise the conditions largest demographic, so educating both students and the society they inhabit is crucial for their health, happiness and safety. By no means should one take this article as anything even remotely approaching medical advice. Rather, use it as an introduction to a few facts about bulimia, anorexia, binge eating disorder and EDNOS (eating disorder not otherwise specified). From here, make further inquiries into the realities faced by sufferers and the people who love them. Making an effort to empathize with their plight might very well save lives someday. Its not just women who suffer: Eating disorders are often stereotyped as the exclusive realm of the ladyfolk  a dangerous mindset preventing male victims from receiving necessary psychotherapy. In reality, between 1% and 7% of college-age men suffer from anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder or EDNOS. But the numbers might actually sit higher than that, as stigmas unfairly painting the diseases as inherently feminine prevent them from admitting the problem and seeking out the mental help needed to survive.The staggering majority of female college students diet: Ninety-one percent in fact, regardless of whether or not they genuinely need to be concerned about their weight. Not all diets are eating disorders, nor do all eating disorders manifest themselves as extreme dieting. Such conditions dont always necessarily stem from a desire to be thin, of course, but overlap does occur. Some cases  though in no way every  do begin life as obsessive dieting, so it is relevant to look at statistics reflecting this.College women are even more vulnerable to eating disorders than one would think: By this point, most people are aware that women between the ages of 17 and 24 are the most likely to be treated for and diagnosed with an eating disorder. In the general public, the statistic posits about 15% of this demographic suffers. But once college factors into the equation, it shoots up to 40%. Hardly surprising, considering the significant amount of stress involved  especially in cases where eating disorders manifest as a coping mechanism.Its often comorbid with other disorders: In college and the real world alike, eating disorders rarely wreak havoc alone. Anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder and EDNOS usually co-exist with depression, anxiety, substance abuse and/or compulsive issues. Oftentimes, the symptoms associated with these conditions are signs of something larger and more serious at play than just problems with diet and nutrition. Social stigmas against anything above a size 6 are only a very minute facet of a far more complex mental health problem.Relationships impact eating disorders: And not just those where one or more partners spout off abusive rhetoric about body shape and size, either. Individuals in unhealthy relationships, whether they be overly clingy or outright physically traumatic, run a much higher risk of suffering from eating disorders than their peers enjoying more stable ones. The depression and anxiety associated with such unfortunate arrangements can trigger these conditions as a means of calming and forgetting the issue at hand.Sexual assault and rape victims are more likely to develop eating disorders: This correlation exists outside of college campuses, however, but the demographic most vulnerable to eating disorders also happens to be more likely to end up sexually assaulted and raped. Thanks to an unforgiving society that shames and guilt trips female and male victims alike, anxiety and depression run rampant. So it makes sense that eating disorders would also plague them at a higher rate, as bulimia, anorexia and the like provide immediate (albeit unhealthy and nonviable) comfort for a persistent problem.Binging and purging may correlate with previous suicide attempts: At least one study suggests that eating disorder victims engaging in a binge-and-purge pattern are more likely to have previously attempted suicide. Those with anorexia are more likely to suffer from suicidal thoughts. Again, a broader study sheds considerable light on the experiences of a smaller demographic. Because of the staggering amount of college students crushed beneath eating disorders, it makes sense that many of them would suffer from the accompanying suicidal ideas and behaviors as well.Nutrition facts can actually trigger victims:Newsweek ran an article about eating disorders on campus in 2009, opening with a particularly poignant perspective most people  in college or otherwise  might never consider. For the eating disordered, seeing campuses publicly display nutrition facts run the risk of triggering trauma during the recovery period. Those whose conditions manifest themselves as obsessive dieting and calorie-counting are especially vulnerable, as exposure to such information reminds them of their destructive obsession. Harvard University removed calorie count cards from its dining halls out of respect for its disordered students.A staggering amount of victims vomit, resort to extreme diets and/or use laxatives: Whether suffering from bulimia, anorexia, EDNOS or some combination thereof, 38% of college students (both male and female) have forced vomiting, used laxatives and/or extreme vomiting in order to lose weight. Researchers think an increased emphasis on combating obesity might influence their harsh decisions, although plenty of other issues  such as the previously-mentioned depression, anxiety and sexual violence victimhood factor into it as well.A fringe eating disorder movement actively encourages the disease: Neither the Pro-Ana nor Pro-Mia movements typically go out and recruit members, but they do dangerously encourage disordered eating habits. Most  but not all  adherents are either in college or of college age, and the philosophy paints the truly horrifying disease as a lifestyle choice to be accepted rather than a mental illness to be treated. Communities both online and off trade thinspiration pictures, advice and encouragement for the fastest (and oftentimes most devastating) weight loss tips. Its an extremely destructive mindset, one colleges must take more seriously and address more often.Binge eating disorder is a real thing: Most individuals and organizations typically think of bulimia and anorexia when the subject of eating disorders crop up. But binge eating disorder  an often overlooked member of the family  can also cause serious problems during the college years (and beyond). Stemming from the exact same anxiety, depression and stress as conditions seeking thinness, BED instead involves taking in too much food as a coping mechanism.Twenty is the most common age of onset: Around 86% of bulimics estimate they first experienced symptoms at age 20. Between the ages of 16 and 20, the number drops to 43%. By freshmen year, between 4.5% and 18% of female and .4% of male students start classes with a history of bulimia, compared to 1% for women with anorexia. Once again, the reasons behind why this happens are as varied as the victims themselves, though the dangers remain the same.Anorexia and bulimia kill more than people realize: Between 10% and 25% of anorexia patients die because of complications arising from the condition. The full recovery rate of eating disorders in general sits at a sadly low 60%, with 20% only partially coming back and 20% never healing at all  or making only negligible progress.Race might have an effect on how eating disorders manifest: Research published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders noted at least one difference in the way weight loss-related eating disorders occur in white and African-American female college students. Many members of the latter demographic typically struggled with real weight and size problems and suffered worse the more they absorbed themselves in mainstream society. Their Caucasian counterparts rarely experienced onset because of a preexisting weight condition. Both, however, frequently exhibited the signs and symptoms of depressive, anxiety or compulsive issues alongside their eating disorders.Online intervention might be a valid prevention option: For the harried, college-aged eating disordered, an online psychiatric regimen might very well pique their recovery. Developed at Stanford University, the online program sought out high-risk women  specifically, college-aged women  and effectively prevented many from slipping into anorexia, bulimia or EDNOS. Participants with a BMI at 25 or over did not develop any eating disorder symptoms after 2 years, compared to 11.9% of their peers. Amongst women already suffering the early stages, 14% ended up diagnosed with an eating disorder within 2 years, compared to 30% of nonparticipants. The program, consisting of reading materials, moderated discussions and daily journals, might very well fulfill a valuable role on college campuses and beyond. 
 When Family Just Doesnt Understand Looking in the Mirror June 27, 2011 Today we are privileged to hear from the talented and wonderful Dr. Ashley Solomon. She is the mastermind behind Nourishing the Soul. I have really enjoyed reading her thoughts and my association with her since starting this blog. Dr. Solomon is a therapist who specializes in treating eating disorders, body image, trauma, and serious mental disorder. The daughter lifts her gaze and with eyes swollen from tears looks at her mother, having just revealed her year-long struggle with her eating disorder. The mother, rocked inside, but in a controlled and loving way, wraps her arms around the one who will always be her little girl. She murmurs gently that she will help in any way she can. Music rises and lights fade. Made-for-television special goes to commercial. As most of who live in a world outside of one constructed in Hollywood know, sharing our deepest secrets and enlisting the support of others doesnt always come quite so easy. And when were talking about parents well, things can be downright painful. Its often said that first step in recovery is admitting you have a problem. Well, the second step is seeking support outside of yourself. Whether were struggling with depression, stress, addiction, a trauma, or eating issues, we need the support of others to help facilitate our journey to a more healthy life. The fact is, not only do we not need to go it alone, but we shouldnt. The importance of social support in recovery is well-established both by research and anecdotally. Various studies show that being bolstered through the tough times can speed up recovery from a host of illnesses. In fact, researchers in one study found that patients who had experienced a heart attack who received high levels of support from family and friends had less chest pain, a better quality of life, better mental and physical functioning, and fewer symptoms of depression compared with those who received little support. When it comes to mental and emotional difficulties, however, garnering support can at times be difficult. Unfortunately, while our culture is moving slowly to a more comprehensive understanding of mental illness, stigma remains (despite the fact that over 44 million people experience a mental disorder each year in the U.S.). When parents learn that their child  even their adult child  has a problem, they can sometimes react with hostility and defensiveness rather than the compassion that we would hope to see from them. While this can be incredibly painful to experience first-hand, it can sometimes be helpful to put these reactions in context. For centuries, parents, and especially mothers, have been put at the center of the ring of blame for their childs maladies. Despite a wealth of evidence indicating that mothers do not cause eating disorders, for example, stereotypes hold fast that leave many mothers feeling that their childs life-threatening condition was caused by their short-comings. Because this is too difficult  unbearable even  to believe, some parents react with defensiveness and anger. Its a way of protecting themselves from the enormity of the pain. Regardless of the reasons, however, it can be devastating to not have ones family on board when one is ready to tackle the issues and make major life changes. It can be extraordinarily helpful to participate in family therapy with an experienced clinician who, from his or her safe and objective seat, can help creatively bring a family to a shared understanding. Unfortunately, some families will simply never be able to to be there in the way that we might hope. In those cases, its vital that we recruit additional support, while also grieving the fact that we may not have the families weve always wanted. Finding support may mean taking an uncomfortable step and making ourselves vulnerable to allowing others in. It may also mean being open to support from unexpected places, such as coworkers, members of your spiritual community, neighbors, and even online. It may involve finding a mentor. Its important to remember that just because we may not be blessed with families who understand us doesnt mean that we are left to be misunderstood. 
 What does recovery look like? by Ashley @ Nourishing the Soul May 30, 2011 After nearly two years of focused work, with a fair share of bumps along the way, Helena has at last reached what her physician considers a healthy weight for her frame. She is eating nutrition-rich meals and hasnt resorted to her trusty elliptical machine to ward off anxiety about donuts or job layoffs in more than a year. She has reconnected with the friends who, two years ago, told her that they felt disconnected from her, that they just couldnt get in. Tonight theyre heading out to karaoke, an activity Helena used to adore because she could show off her powerful chops. Would you call Helena recovered? In recovery? Partially recovered? Still in the grips of an eating disorder? Think about that for a moment. Now, would the label you assign change if I told you that Helena still counts calories almost every day? What if she only occasionally read nutrition labels  a former obsession  and only to check the amount of calcium and protein in her food? What if she still hates the way her legs look and cries regularly about not measuring up to her friends? What if instead she doesnt hate the way that she looks, but is cautiously proud of her body  harboring fear, however mild, that her weight could shoot up? What if her food and weight obsessions were gone, but her perfectionism had translated into other areas of her life  like her work as a financial analyst? Now what would call Helena? Fully recovered? Partially? In recovery? Nowhere close? If your label changed, think about why. On what did you base you assessment? Assigning labels to the odyssey that is recovery is a challenge faced by clinical researchers, clinicians treating these individuals, and perhaps most significantly, individuals themselves. At the Academy for Eating Disorders international conference recently, I had the opportunity to hear Anna Bardone-Cone, Ph.D speak about her work in defining recovery. Dr. Bardone-Cone recognized just how disparate definitions of recovery are across the literature on eating disorders. Looking at how various researchers defined recovery, we see that some do by the simple (though admittedly not so simple) restoration of weight, some by the absence of symptoms (e.g. restricting or binging), and some by more complex rubrics incorporating a persons thoughts or attitudes. The problem is that when researchers are comparing treatments and other factors based on recovery that is defined differently, we really cannot compare at all. There are other implications of a lack of consistent recovery definition as well. For one, individuals who struggle want to know what recovery will look like. While every single persons journey will look different, it provides guidance and hope for individuals to understand just what they are working towards. Its important, too, for individuals to know that recovery  full recovery, as I define it  is not simply about having a regular period (for females) or stopping their binge eating. I am someone who believes that the idea of full recovery is real and can be attained by anyone with the right resources. These resources include a commitment to the process and a team of personal and professional support. So what does full recovery look like? Like I said, the details might look different for different individuals, but I believe that recovery involves three main areas: physical, behavioral, and emotional. What this means is that those in full recovery are physically healthy and medically stable, are not using eating disorder behaviors, and they have developed a healthier attitude toward things like shape, weight, and food. Does this mean that a person in recovery never bemoans the size of her thighs? Dr. Bardone-Cone says no, and astutely remarked in our workshop that we cant expect those recovering from eating disorders to be super-people, free from the worries and concerns that are part of normal development and living in our society. We do of course hope that they have the skills to combat those thoughts when they arise, however. Occasional thoughts and concerns dont mean a person isnt recovered, just like occasional aches dont mean that a person who had the flu once still has it. Others prefer to use the terminology that is often used in circles of those who struggle with substance abuse and addictions and to refer to themselves forever as in recovery. Often the idea behind this semantic difference is that one will be aware and mindful of the possibility of returning to old habits in the face of stressors (as a person with a history of alcoholism might always need to be aware of the temptation to drink). Personally, I respect any perspective on recovery that feels genuine and helpful to a person in maintaining health and happiness. However you lay it out, the fact is that there is tremendous hope out there for those struggling with eating disorders, and for those who have struggled in the past. Despite recent press that paints a picture of recovery of elusive, its not at all. Its difficult, sure. But its also attainable. If youre still wondering about what recovery might look like, Aimee Lius new book, Restoring Our Bodies, Reclaiming Our Lives, is a fantastic resource full of first-person accounts of the recovery process. 
 Eating Disorder Guidelines Released by Megan Brooks, Medscape May 20, 2011 The Academy of Eating Disorders (AED) has published guidelines for detecting and managing eating disorders in primary care practice. "Eating disorders are generally first picked up in primary care physicians' offices, but there is very little training in recognition, detection, diagnosis, and treatment of eating disorders in either medical school or residency," Mark Warren, MD, cochair of the task force that wrote the guidelines, noted in an interview with Medscape Medical News. Eating Disorders: Critical Points for Early Recognition and Medical Risk Management in the Care of Individuals with Eating Disorders can be downloaded from the academy's web site. There is also a brochure that can be downloaded for printing and distribution. Designed to be user-friendly, the document provides a list of signs and symptoms and strategies to help general practitioners make an early diagnosis, medically stabilize patients, and initiate evidence-based care for patients with eating disorders. Sections include what the physical examination should include; what laboratory and imaging studies to obtain; risk factors and prevention strategies for the refeeding syndrome, a potentially fatal shift of fluid and electrolytes that can occur when refeeding (orally, enterally, or parenterally) a malnourished patient; timely interventions; goals of treatment; and ongoing management. Eating disorders can have life-threatening physical and psychological consequences, the task force notes, and they affect not only girls and women but also boys and men, people from all ethnicities and socioeconomic backgrounds, and people with a variety of body shapes, weights, and sizes. "It is important to remember that eating disorders do not only affect females at low weight," the authors note, and that weight is not the only clinical marker of an eating disorder; people who are at normal weight can have an eating disorder. Endorsed by Pediatricians "All instances of precipitous weight loss in otherwise healthy individuals should be investigated for the possibility of an eating disorder, including post–bariatric surgery patients. In addition, rapid weight gain or weight fluctuation can be a potential marker of an eating disorder," the authors report. The possibility of an eating disorder should also be considered in children and adolescents who fail to gain expected weight or height and/or when delayed/interrupted pubertal development is evident. "We are hoping this resource makes a huge difference for primary care doctors who are the front line of care for people with eating disorders," said Dr. Warren, medical director of the Cleveland Center for Eating Disorders in Ohio. He said the guidelines have been vetted by experts in the field of eating disorders. "The Society of Adolescent Medicine has endorsed it, and we just learned that the American Academy of Pediatrics will also endorse it. We're also looking to the American Psychiatric Association and other professional organizations to endorse it — and I think they will — and really encourage their members to use it," Dr. Warren said. "Too many patients with eating disorders don't get expert care until after a long period of illness," Dr. Warren added. "Better information in the hands of primary care physicians will be of huge value to those who suffer from eating disorders." "Our hope is that professionals, patients, and families will access this material to ensure that care is prompt, safe, and supported by evidence and that each person with an eating disorder has the opportunity for a full recovery and a productive life," said task force cochair Ovidio Bermudez, MD, medical director of adolescent services at Eating Recovery Center in Denver, Colorado. The authors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. 
 Does Eating Give You Pleasure, Or Make You Anxious? by Kathy, Shrink Rap Blog May 20, 2011 A new study reveals biological reasons for feelings of anxiety instead of reward in patients with anorexia Perhaps the most puzzling symptom of anorexia nervosa  a disorder that tends to occur in young women  is the refusal to eat, resulting in extreme weight loss. While most people have a great deal of difficulty in dieting and losing weight, particularly if a diet extends over many months or years, individuals with anorexia nervosa can literally diet themselves to death. In fact, this disorder has a very high death rate from starvation. A new study, now online in the journal International Journal of Eating Disorders, sheds light on why these symptoms occur in anorexia nervosa. Most people find eating to be a pleasant and rewarding experience. In contrast, people with anorexia nervosa often say that eating makes them more anxious, and food refusal makes them feel better. Research over the past decade has provided new insights into the brain mechanisms that are associated with the rewarding aspects of eating. One of these brain chemicals is dopamine, which is released when people or animals eat tasty foods. A study led by Walter Kaye, MD, professor of psychiatry and director of the Eating Disorder Treatment and Research Program at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, used a brain imaging technology called positron emission tomography (PET), which permits visualization of dopamine function in the brain. In order to provoke dopamine levels in the brain, scientists administered a one-time dose of the drug amphetamine, which releases dopamine in the brain. In healthy women without an eating disorder, amphetamine-induced release of dopamine was related to feelings of extreme pleasure in a part of the brain known as a reward center. However, in people who had anorexia nervosa, amphetamine made them feel anxious, and the part of the brain that was activated was, instead, a part of the brain that worries about consequences. This is the first study to demonstrate a biological reason why individuals with anorexia nervosa have a paradoxical response to food, said Kaye. Its possible that when people with anorexia nervosa eat, the related release of the neurotransmitter dopamine makes them anxious, rather than experiencing a normal feeling of reward. It is understandable why it is so difficult to get people with anorexia nervosa to eat and gain weight, because food generates intensely uncomfortable feelings of anxiety. Importantly, this study was of people who have recovered from anorexia nervosa for at least a year, suggesting that the feeling provoked may be due to pre-existing traits, rather than a response to being at an extremely low weight. In terms of impact on treatment strategies, there are no currently proven treatments that reduce core symptoms in anorexia nervosa, such as eating-induced anxiety. According to the researchers, even though food is accompanied by severe anxiety, it is still critical to eat and gain weight in order to effectively treat this disorder. Source: University of California, San Diego Health Sciences Contributors to the study include Ursula F. Bailer, MD, Medical University of Vienna and UCSD Department of Psychiatry; Vikas Duvvuri, MD, PhD, UCSD Department of Psychiatry; and Rajesh Narendran, MD, W. Gordon Frankle, MD, Michael L. Himes and Chester A. Mathis, PhD, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. These results have been published on line in the International Journal of Eating Disorders. 
 A question of stigma Carrie Arnold, Psychology Today May 19, 2011 Eating disorders are a biologically-based mental illness People think they know what it's like to have anorexia. They tell me of how they once went all day without eating. Or those few weeks when they thought they had to go to the gym every single day. They bitch about their thighs and stomachs and butts, and swear their jeans make them like huge, like a cow--no, not a cow. A whale. Leviathan. They tell me of the crazy diets they were on in high school and college, where they ate nothing but cabbage or grapefruit or sausage or special weight-loss cookies. I'm not saying these experiences aren't disturbing and sad. I'm not saying they aren't symptoms of a fundamentally screwed up culture. But they're not anorexia. The sooner we can separate dieting and eating disorders, the better. Our society doesn't understand eating disorders. They're seen as an uber-extreme diet of control freak teen girls, a phase that people will grow out of, a desire to look like models and celebrities, a choice, a teen trying to find freedom from her (and it's always a "she") from her over-controlling family, an expression of vanity. The truth is this: eating disorders are a biologically-based mental illness that sufferers don't choose and parents (and culture) don't cause. This cultural misunderstanding of what eating disorders actually are goes a long way in creating much of the stigma that surrounds this condition. If people are told that eliminating Barbies will curb eating disorders, then it's easy to view those who have eating disorders as a bunch of vain and vapid idiots. Visit an eating disorder clinic, though, and you will quickly learn that eating disorders aren't diseases of vanity. Look at the research and you'll see that eating disorders aren't just a phase people grow out of, that genetics is a major risk factor, and that eating disorders are the most deadly of all psychiatric illnesses. In a post from the blog Weightless earlier this week, blogger Marina Tartakovsky quotes Aimee Liu's new book, Restoring Our Bodies, Reclaiming Our Lives: "...Yet eating disorders receive only a fraction of the research funding that goes to these other conditions (schizophrenia, alcoholism, depression). And in most regions of the world, private insurance and government funding for treatment are not adequate to support the specialize care required to cure these illnesses. Why? The answer, in a word, is stigma."Mental illness in general is surrounded by lots of stigma. It's all in our heads (obviously--it's not called mental illness for nothing), we should just get over it, it's all a big conspiracy from Big Pharma. Whatever. But just as understanding the true nature of epilepsy and seizure disorders shifted them from demon posession to actual illnesses, so, too, will a better understanding of what eating disorders actually are. Writes Liu: "The stigma that surrounds eating disorders paints them as trivial girl problems,' diets gone awry, adolescent rites of passage, or the acting out of juvenile rebels or control freaks.' Anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating disorders are sensationalized by the media as celebrity spectacles. Even the medical profession, by and large, still dismisses disordered eating as a behavioral quirk and thus fails to recognize the serious psychological threat this behavior represents. Stigma suppresses funding and attention to eating-disorders research and is a primary obstacle to adequate treatment and prevention efforts."So where do we start? First up, we need to stop blaming the sufferer and his/her families. If you feel to blame for an illness, you're much less likely to stand up and advocate for the treatment you need. Second, we need better media coverage of eating disorders. Instead of focusing on celebrities and starlets and models and body image, we need to start covering research advances with the same splashy headlines. Let's not sensationalize deadly illnesses. Let's not place stories on eating disorders in the "Style" section. They're not a style or a fad. This is where I see science stepping in. Rather than being a resource for unemotional data wonks (don't worry, I was one of these once!), science can actually increase understanding and compassion towards people with eating disorders. A study in the International Journal of Eating Disorders found that explaining the biological nature of anorexia increased college students' understanding of sufferers and decreased blame. These research studies are more than just a sympathy ploy. Until recently, it was perfectly legal to deny life-saving medical care for eating disorders in New Jersey because they weren't considered "biologically-based mental illnesses." But families teamed up and sued their insurance companies, citing evidence that 50-85% of the risk for anorexia is genetic, and that relatives of an eating disorder sufferer are twelve times more likelyto suffer from an eating disorder. Both of these studies indicate that eating disorders are rooted in biology. With science on their side, the families won their suit. Mostly, what people with eating disorders need is consideration and compassion. If you know a person with an eating disorder and aren't sure what to say, think about what you would say to a person with cancer. That's the kindness sufferers need, because it's not something we chose. 
 Isolation in Eating Disorders by Leora Fulvi, Recover May 17, 2011 Isolation and eating disorders go together for many reasons. Often people find themselves avoiding situations where food will be involved because they are either afraid of overeating or they dont want deal with the questions or the looks if they are restricting. People also find that they begin pushing away friends, family, and partners in order to spend more time with their ED behaviors. Some women or men prefer to spend the night alone or away from their boyfriend or girlfriend in order to spend the night bingeing. Some will prioritize gym time at the expense of loved ones. Many bow out of social obligations because they are not comfortable with their bodies and are afraid that they will be judged. Reaching out is a huge part of recovery. This doesnt necessarily mean going to an eating disorder recovery group or a support group or 12 step group, although these things can be very important for recovery. This can be as simple as reaching out to friends, parents, family members or even people who you dont know very well, who you can just be social with. Being out in the world rather than being alone with your disorder is one of the great ways to find recovery. Connection with people  even when you feel imperfect, even when youd rather be at home bingeing or running on the treadmill or avoiding food and people- can help you heal. We are interdependent beings. You dont even have to talk about your feelings or what youre going through, just being with people who you enjoy, just having contact with others and getting out of the isolation trap is a giant step toward freedom from your addiction. Next time you have the urge to isolate, try to reach out and spend some time with a friend, or a family member, or even a neighbor or someone you dont know very well. You can even do volunteer work at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter, or a community garden. Anything that gets you out and close to other humans can be healing. 
 Orthorexia: When Good Eating Goes Bad by Pamela Wiegartz, Ph.D. April 28, 2011 Sometimes healthy eating can make you sick What is orthorexia? The term comes from the Greek words ortho, meaning straight, right or correct, and orexis, or appetite; so orthorexia literally means "correct eating." Orthorexics are characterized by an obsession with healthy eating, avoiding the many foods that they perceive to be unhealthy. This preoccupation with food leads to meticulous and inflexible eating that goes well beyond making smart food choices. Different from anorexia, the goal of eating is not to be thin or to lose weight but to eat "right." What's wrong with healthy eating? There is nothing wrong with eating healthy foods unless this inflexibility consumes your life. Health conscious eaters have diets based in moderation. They can make choices that are not dictated by food, can be flexible in eating when they need to be, and don't think about food all that much. Sufferers of orthorexia, on the other hand, make decisions around food, decline social invitations based on the menu, and spend a lot of time considering what they eat. Take a look at the checklist below to see if you share any orthorexic features. Do you have an extreme preoccupation with food or the quality of the food?Have you eliminated many "unhealthy" foods from your diet?Do you eat only a few foods?Do you focus on the virtuousness of eating?Does your eating negatively impact your quality of life?Are you judgmental of others' food choices?Are you socially isolated because of your eating habits?Do you have rigid eating habits that never allow certain foods?Do you experience guilt or self-loathing when you stray from your diet?If you answered "yes" to many of these questions, consider whether your eating habits may be causing you more harm than good. Because orthorexics often have such a limited diet there can be serious health consequences from vitamin, mineral, and caloric deficiencies. Ironically, the quest for perfectly healthy eating can instead result in anemia, osteopenia or other health detriments. What is the treatment for orthorexia? Orthorexia is such a newly named phenomenon that there are no scientific studies demonstrating what treatments may be most effective for this condition. However, we may be able to extrapolate what methods could be of benefit--for example, cognitive-behavioral therapy strategies such as targeting distorted beliefs and graduated exposure to feared foods. In cognitive therapy, orthorexic beliefs about the need for perfection and the danger of occasionally eating unhealthy foods could be addressed. Detailing the true benefits of eating in this manner versus the costs--social isolation, loss of spontaneity and decreased quality of life--may be useful in motivating sufferers to relax their standards to more realistic levels and to gradually reincorporate feared foods into their diets. What is the bottom line? Research studies are needed to better delineate what orthorexia is and how it can be treated. It appears that a significant number of people fall prey to this preoccupation with eating correctly. And because this condition far exceeds simply "healthy eating", the consequences can be serious. Until treatment protocols specifically tailored to orthorexia can be created and studied, cognitive-behavioral strategies designed to address the perfectionistic beliefs and compulsive behavior that characterize orthorexia may be the best path to true health via moderation. 
 In Fighting Anorexia, Recovery Is Elusive By ABBY ELLIN, New York Times April 25, 2011 Dr. Suzanne Dooley-Hash believes that she will never fully recover from the anorexia that has plagued her since she was 15 years old. For many years, she did not take laxatives constantly to lose weight, as she did in the mid-1980s, and her health was relatively O.K. Thoughts about her weight did not occupy every second of every minute of every day. But in 2005 she relapsed, losing one-third of her body weight in six months. She took off 19 months from her job as an emergency room physician at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor to devote herself to getting her life back in order. Like many patients with eating disorders, however, she is not sure what recovery means. Does it mean functional?  asked Dr. Dooley-Hash, 45. Im a physician at a really high-powered institution, and Ive published in well-respected journals  Im functional. I dont think functionality is necessarily a good measure. Dr. Dooley-Hash is not alone in her confusion. Most medical experts agree that a third of people with the disorder will remain chronically ill, a third will die of their disorder, and a third will recover  with one significant caveat. There is surprisingly little agreement as to what recovery means for people with anorexia. Indeed, just a handful of studies on long-term recovery rates have been conducted over the last decade or so, and different parameters were used in each one. Without consistency, its hard to compare across studies, said Dr. Michael Strober, a professor of eating disorders and psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles. You just have to know how recovery is defined in each study to have a balanced interpretation. It is difficult to define recovery from an illness that has both physical and mental dimensions. If, for example, a patient reaches normal weight  which researchers define as either 85 or 95 percent of a persons ideal weight  and starts menstruating again, she would be considered to have recovered in most studies. But what if she still weighs herself daily, monitors her calories with a vengeance and obsesses about food and the size of her ankles? Or, as is often the case, moves from anorexia to bulimia or binge-eating disorder? About 50 percent of people with anorexia will be able to reach and maintain a normal weight, but most of them are very preoccupied with the calorie content of food, said Dr. Katharine Halmi, professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. Still, she added: Many people whove never had anorexia watch their diet carefully. So the big issue is, how do you define recovery? Maintaining a normal weight, recurrence of menstruation is easy to document. Mental status is a different problem. With that in mind, many with anorexia prefer to view recovery as many alcoholics do  the disease may be in remission, but the potential for relapse always lurks in the background. Some people find comfort in saying recovering so they dont have to be responsible for being recovered, which means I will never relapse,  said Aimee Liu, 57, author of Restoring Our Bodies, Reclaiming Our Lives. Others, she said, liken their eating disorder to managing a chronic illness like diabetes, requiring constant vigilance. I say to patients, This is your Achilles heel,  said Dr. Daniel Le Grange, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Chicago and director of the eating disorders program at the University of Chicago Medical Center. If you have another crisis, youre predisposed to resorting to starvation as your way of managing that issue. It would be foolish of us as clinicians not to prepare our patients that they should be on the lookout for a recurrence. Most doctors believe recovery from anorexia is rarely absolute and more often occurs by degrees. While patients may get better, aspects of their disease will continue to nag at them. The literature suggests you can have physical recovery from the weight loss, but the cognitive symptoms might not continue to get better, said Dr. Kamryn T. Eddy, a psychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. They definitely do improve, but one of the things we wonder is, how well does one have to be to be recovered? And how well does one actually get? In the absence of expert consensus, patients and caregivers have come up with their own definitions of recovery. Harriet Brown, author of the recently released Brave Girl Eating, a memoir of her 14-year-old daughters bout with anorexia, defines it as absolutely ordinary relations with food. And what exactly is ordinary? That thinking about food does not consume large quantities of your time and energy, she said in an interview. You enjoy food, you dont undereat or overeat often, you dont meet any of the diagnostic criteria for anorexia. Your weight is in a healthy range for you. And most of all, youre able to live life in a way thats not completely organized around food and eating. For Ms. Liu, recovery is a full restoration of nutritional, physical, emotional and psychological health. But in a telephone conversation, Ms. Liu, who was actively anorexic from age 13 to 20, acknowledged that without good treatment many people spend years in what she called the half life of anorexia. They recover nutritionally and suspend the behaviors of starving, bingeing and purging, said Ms. Liu, who suffered a relapse 11 years ago. But the self-criticism, self-abuse, perfectionism, judgmentalism and restrictive mind-set persist. Still, both doctors and patients emphasize the importance of believing that full recovery is an option. Kathleen MacDonald, a policy assistant at the Eating Disorders Coalition in Washington, was anorexic and then bulimic for 16 years, but considers herself fully recovered since 2004. People always said once you have an eating disorder, youre always going to have an eating disorder, she said. I tell people, There was a time in your life when you didnt have an eating disorder, and if thats possible, anything is.  For Dr. Dooley-Hash, the future feels a little murkier. I feel like I cant ever be off guard, she said. The next time Im overwhelmed and stressed, my first instinct is going to go back to restricting. I think I would be naïve to think it would ever not be a part of my life. 
 Lately my eating habits and attitudes toward food have been changing in a way that worries me quite a bit. A year or two ago I used to binge eat whenever I was upset, but then I knocked that off almost a year ago. My problem now is that I'm becoming really worried about eating. I skip meals sometimes and then when I do end up eating I stress out because I feel like I've failed myself. I've started to hate eating because I always feel so guilty after. I'm not particularly worried about my weight, I'd be happier if I was a few pounds lighter but I'm not overweight, but for some reason I can't stop worrying about food. I'm always scared I won't be able to stop eating when I eat something. Sometimes I catch myself doing a bit of it where I'll notice I'm full but keep eating, and then I start freaking out and feel out of control. This is really stressing me out, I don't know what's wrong with me and this whole situation is driving me crazy. 
 Galia Slayen: The Scary Reality of a Real-Life Barbie Doll 04/ 8/11 Attachment 2759 Some people have skeletons in their closet. I have an enormous Barbie in mine. She stands about six feet tall with a 39" bust, 18" waist, and 33" hips. These are the supposed measurements of Barbie if she were a real person. I built her as a part of the first National Eating Disorder Awareness Week (NEDAW) at my high school, later introducing her to Hamilton College during its first NEDAW in 2011. When I was a little girl, I played with my Barbie in her playhouse, sending her and Ken on dates that always ended with a goodnight kiss. I had fond times with my Barbie, and I admired her perfect blonde locks and slim figure. Barbie represented beauty, perfection and the ideal for young girls around the world. At least, as a seven-year-old, that is what she was to me. In January 2007, I was looking for a way to make my peers realize the importance of eating disorders and body image issues. I was frustrated after quitting the cheerleading squad, frustrated with pressures to look and act a certain way and most of all frustrated with the eating disorder controlling my life. I wanted to do something that would turn others' apathy into action. That evening, my neighbor and I found two long pieces of wood and started measuring. With a little math, nails and hammering, we built a stick figure that stood about six feet tall. The chicken wire came next. Surrounding her wooden frame, we created a body that wasn't much thicker than a stick figure, but had the womanly and unattainable curves and proportions that impressionable young girls idealize. We stuffed the chicken wire with newspaper and created a body that creepily leaned against the wall in my neighbor's basement. She now needed some skin, so I brought her back to my apartment and employed the masterful art of papier maché. Taking stacks of newspaper, glue and water, I skipped my high school semi-formal dance to give my girl some skin. Oddly, I started to feel my fondness for Barbie return, now not as a plaything but as a tool to reveal the negative body image that she promotes. As I papier machéd, I couldn't forget Barbie's impressive bust and blew up balloons over and over again to achieve a perfect 39" measurement. Once her chest was secured, I spent hours dipping and smoothing the paper, and later mixed paints to replicate her seemingly perfect white skin tone. With a little hard work and a lot of time, a headless, footless and handless body soon stood in my apartment. But it was then I became stumped. I couldn't figure out how to recreate the recognizable face of the Barbie we all know and love. With NEDAW just around the corner, I was panicked. On my way to get office supplies, I drove by a Toys 'R' Us, and that's when it hit me. Remember that Barbie with just shoulders and a head, meant for you to practice brushing her hair? I confidently walked into the toy store for the first time since I was a kid. I found the Barbie head, found a friend to assemble that head, and clothed Barbie for her first debut. I dressed Barbie in my old clothes. The skirt she still has on today is a reminder of who I once was. That skirt, a size double zero, used to slip off my waist when I was struggling with anorexia. I put it on Barbie to serve as a reminder that the way Barbie looks, the way I once looked, is not healthy and is not "normal," whatever normal might mean. My Barbie's role is simple. She grabs the attention of apathetic onlookers and makes them think and talk about an issue that thrives in silence. In the last four years, Barbie has surpassed my expectations, attracting attention and sparking conversation among listeners and readers across the nation. Once a year, at the end of February, Barbie comes out of the closet to meet my friends, strangers, and those apathetic onlookers. During NEDAW, she reminds people that eating disorders and body image issues are serious and prevalent. Holding an awareness week in high school or college is just one way to get students to discuss these important issues. However, constant discussion and education is key to dealing with and overcoming eating disorders. Despite her bizarre appearance, Barbie provides something that many advocacy efforts lack. She reminds of something we once loved, while showing us the absurdity of our obsession with perfection.  More "Get Real, Barbie" statistics: There are two Barbie dolls sold every second in the world.The target market for Barbie doll sales is young girls ages 3-12 years of age.A girl usually has her first Barbie by age 3, and collects a total of seven dolls during her childhood.Over a billion dollars worth of Barbie dolls and accessories were sold in 1993, making this doll big business and one of the top 10 toys sold.If Barbie were an actual women, she would be 5'9" tall, have a 39" bust, an 18" waist, 33" hips and a size 3 shoe.Barbie calls this a "full figure" and likes her weight at 110 lbs.At 5'9" tall and weighing 110 lbs, Barbie would ... fit the weight criteria for anorexia. She likely would not menstruate.If Barbie was a real woman, she'd have to walk on all fours due to her proportions.Slumber Party Barbie was introduced in 1965 and came with a bathroom scale permanently set at 110 lbs with a book entitled "How to Lose Weight" with directions inside stating simply "Don't eat." 
 Another step towards FREEdom: The amazing efforts of the FREED Act to help eliminate eating disorders Kate Daigle Counseling April 18, 2011 Amazing and inspiring efforts are continually being made to erase and eradicate eating disorders and to raise awareness about their deadly effects. Just last week a group of teenagers from Boulder went to Washington, DC to lobby and testify before Congress in support of the FREED Act (Federal Response to Eliminate Eating Disorders)! Staggering statistics they are fighting against: 45% of girls and boys in elementary schools want to be thinner and and 9% of nine-year-olds have purged in order to lose weight. Thats NINE year olds!! Reality is hard enough when you are older.to be thinking about weight loss and hurting your bodies at age nine is a tragedy. Watch this local news video to learn more about the Boulder teens efforts in front of Congress (they got to meet with some pretty fascinating and powerful people!): So what is the FREED Act exactly? This Act was conceptualized in February 2009 by the Eating Disorders Coalition, which is a group based out of Washington, DC whose mission is to advance the federal recognition of eating disorders as a public policy priority. It is the first comprehensive legislative effort introduced in the Senate to confront the seriousness of eating disorders and to jump start research and advance the treatment, prevention, diagnosis, screening, and awareness of these diseases. It also brings attention to the lack of initiative on the part of insurance companies to recognize the seriousness of these diseases and to increase coverage for treatment. This is revolutionary! The bill, put to the Senate by Congressman Patrick Kennedy, strongly commands attention to the devastation of eating disorders and outlines a plan for education and prevention initiatives  some of which include: studying the why and the effects of mandatory BMI reporting in schools; a grant program for training all types of health professionals about eating disorders; plans for educating the public about EDs through public services announcements; and bringing eating disorders into already existing initiatives about obesity (this one I find very interesting as there is a stigma about obesity and eating disorders and we need to understand their link and how both can be prevented). The awareness piece involves educating professionals and the public about the death rates of eating disorders (not spotlighted clearly or often enough), providing care according to universally accepted criteria, and having the bottom-line assertion that all Americans with eating disorders deserve care. A blog that I read wrote last year about the FREED Act, and pointed out that the National Institute of Health (NIH) allows $1.20 per person towards research for those with eating disorders compared to the $159 per person towards research for those dealing with schizophrenia  a disease whose prevalence is significantly less than those affected by eating disorders. This statistic underlines the fact that research and effort into understanding eating disorders is considerably lacking as composed to other types of disorders, and their death rates are often higher than those other disorders. The FREED Act currently has bipartisan support and hopefully will pass! In 2009, the bill had 20 sponsors and 44 different local and national organizations wrote a letter to Congress in support of the act! Now is your opportunity to act as well!! What can you do? You can write a letter to Congress by writing your local Representative at this link. You can check out the inspiring work of the Boulder Youth Body Alliance and attend a talk on April 25th at 6:00pm on the Naropa University Campus where you can come hear our youth talk about their experiences of advocating for the FREED Act (Federal Response to Eliminate Eating Disorders) in Washington DC. They will talk about the bill, what theyve learned, and three will share their speeches from the Congressional Briefing. Now is the time for the change that will save lives! 
 Eating Disorders and the Holidays | Eating Disorders Treatment (link removed by request) by Dr. Jonathan Rader on Nov 23, 2010 The period from Halloween through the New Year is particularly difficult for those suffering with eating disorders, or in recovery, because most of the festivities of the holiday season emphasize the consumption of food. In addition to the stress of dealing with a constant barrage of food-oriented conversation and social events, the eating disordered must deal with exposure to the spate of advertisements for weight-control solutions that surface at this time of year. The emotional stress and anxiety experienced by individuals dealing with anorexia, bulimia or compulsive overeating disorder is further exacerbated by complex nature of their relationships with family members and others at gatherings such as holiday meals. When it comes to the family gathering for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, there is often a general tension regarding the eating disordered individual’s participation. Many anorexics or bulimics cannot help but feel the oppressive scrutiny of their every action. They sense that others are keeping a secret ledger and calculating the caloric value of every bite they consume. However, the family meal does not have to be fraught with such anxiety if the eating disordered individual prepares emotionally in advance. A good eating disorder treatment program will provide an individual with the necessary psychological tools to reduce the negative feelings and reduce the anxieties that can arise in the midst of a large meal with family members. Keep in mind that the emotional triggers that afflict the eating disordered exist well beyond the dinner table. Given the frequently excessive nature of the holiday table, there is almost always postprandial discussion involving statements such as “I shouldn’t have eaten so much,” and “I have got to hit the gym first thing tomorrow.” These sorts of remarks in combination with the media’s typical focus on “diet advice” can really test the emotional wherewithal of even individuals with presumably healthy eating habits. For the eating disordered, the increased exposure to food-centric situations and information can influence bad food management strategies such as binging and purging or other dangerous behavior. The best way to approach the holiday season for the eating disordered individual is with awareness that she or he is bound to be in situations or at gatherings where food is central. Discussing one’s fears and anxieties with a mental health professional and developing a plan on how to positively cope with the stress associated with these situations is a good first step to getting through the holidays. A good therapist understands this is a tough time of year and will address the food concerns and underlying psychological issues of the eating disordered individual. Just like the holiday meal, emotional well-being requires a lot of care and planning. 
 Overeating, alcohol abuse and depression intertwined in young women By Amy Sutton, HBNS contributing writer Friday, 11 September 2009 On TV, Sex and the City makes regular Cosmo-drinking sessions seem like a glamorous, harmless pastime. In reality, though, excessive alcohol use can relate to overeating and depression in young women, according to the results of a new study. "Anyone who has been touched by depression, obesity or alcoholism knows that these disorders on their own can be devastating. When they're combined, these disorders become more costly, more difficult to treat and more impairing," said Carolyn McCarty, PhD, lead study author and a research associate professor at the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Research Institute. In the study in the September/October issue of the journal General Hospital Psychiatry, the researchers surveyed 393 men and 383 women at ages 24, 27 and 30 about their weight, alcohol use and depression symptoms within the last year. "When you look across time, alcohol use and obesity predicted later depression. The big picture here is that these disorders, though they're different in manifestation and symptoms, appear to be related for some groups of women." McCarty said. The researchers found that women who had alcohol use disorders at age 24 were more than three times as likely to be obese at age 27, compared to women who did not. In addition, women who were obese at age 27 were more than twice as likely to be depressed at age 30, and women who were depressed at age 27 had an increased risk of alcohol disorders at age 30. For young men, the disorders did not appear to have similar connections over time. "From a clinical or health care provider perspective, when you think about what to do about one of these problems, you have to think about what to do about the other," said Gregory Simon, MD, a psychiatrist and researcher at the Group Health Center for Health Studies in Seattle. "Being overweight is the norm among people who are depressed, so when helping people with depression, you've got to think about how their weight is related." Simon had no affiliation with the study. Although she noted more research is necessary to understand why these disorders are more related in women, McCarty suggested that women might be more likely to ruminate, or "chew" on problems in response to stress, which could increase the likelihood of developing depression, eating problems and substance abuse. Different biological pathways in the brain might also play a role. Source: McCarty CA, Kosterman R, Mason A, et al.

 I came across this article about Urban Outfitters and something I would consider to be a tasteless (no pun intended) shirt. This wouldn't be the first time they have had some controversy, their advertising use to consist of girls about age 12 or at least they looked that way, wearing clothes that even I would not wear at my age. I am very modest though so maybe I am just a prude. lol I guess controversy does mean free advertising though. I went to the actual website (bad idea). DO NOT GO THERE IF YOUR EASILY TRIGGERED. A lot of very thin girls, but I also came across another T-shirt that read "Alcohol,caffeine,cigarettes". Which is not only promoting the obvious but if you have been around ED "culture" (I roll my eyes at that) then you know what that means. Here is a link to the article with the other t-shirt, not a link to the website. Urban Outfitters' Eat Less T-Shirt Controversy Plus the fact that if this was aimed as a message toward obese people, how incredibly cruel and discriminating that is. Does anyone else think this is promoting eating disorders or just a novelty type T? 
 Sex hormone implicated in eating disorder onset CBC News Friday, June 4, 2010 A biological factor may play an essential part in the development of eating disorders in girls during puberty, a new study finds. The research, led by Michigan State University (MSU) scientists, finds that the genes of girls who have higher levels of estradiol at puberty can act as a catalyst for the development of eating disorders. Estradiol is the primary form of estrogen in women's bodies. It plays a key role in the development of secondary sex characteristics and bone development. "The reason we see an increase in genetic influences during puberty is that the genes for disordered eating are essentially getting switched on during that time," said Kelly Klump, MSU associate professor of psychology, in a release. "What we found is that increases in estradiol apparently are activating genetic risk for eating disorders." The genes responsible for activating eating disorders have yet to be identified. The researchers also believe that environmental factors and a genetic link (having a family history of eating disorders) play a part in the development of the condition. The researchers measured the amount of estradiol in the bloodstreams of 200 sets of twin girls between the ages of 10 and 15. The study is published in the journal Psychological Medicine. 
 Anxiety and Eating Disorders By Laura L. Smith, Ph.D., Anxiety & OCD Exposed Many of our clients with anxiety also have reported struggles over food. Therefore, we interviewed a colleague who is an expert on eating disorders. Dr. Brenda L. Wolfe is a clinical psychologist who specializes in the treatment of obesity and eating disorders. In addition to private practice, she has published a number of articles and books. Her most recent book reflects her other area of expertise and is called Get Your Loved One Sober which is co-authored with Robert J. Meyers and available from most internet book-sellers. Q. What is an eating disorder and about how many people have real eating disorders? Eating disorders are characterized by an excessive preoccupation with body size and unhealthy attempts to control it. People with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) restrict their food intake in an effort to lose weight despite the fact that they are becoming malnourished. People with Bulimia Nervosa (BN) restrict their intake and end up binge eating, which triggers anxiety about gaining weight and so they try to purge the calories through a variety of unhealthy behaviors. Some people have unhealthy eating behavior that doesn’t quite fit AN or BN (such as binge eating) so they are given a label of Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. Because of the shame felt by people with these disorders, they tend not to show up in clinics until they are so ill they can no longer ignore the problem. Thus, I suspect we underestimate their prevalence. Available estimates are that AN afflicts 0.5% to 1% and BN about 10% of females, while binge eating occurs in roughly 15% to 30% of the overweight/obese population. Males report lower rates of eating disorders than do females. Q. Is obesity really an eating disorder? No. Obesity is a medical condition that involves an interaction of psychology, biology, and environment. From a psychological standpoint, anxiety and mood disorders frequently trigger overeating. Q. What does anxiety have to do with eating disorders? Fear of fat is central to the psychology of eating disorders. People with AN and BN are so terrified of gaining weight that they engage in all manner of harmful behaviors. Although it is an oversimplification to call eating disorders “fat anxiety,” that certainly describes a chunk of the problem. Q. If you have both anxiety and an eating disorder, what should you treat first? Rarely does a person experience an eating disorder and anxiety as separate problems. What I typically see are patients who have tremendous anxiety and/or OCD around body/food issues. Treating the ED component usually results in a lessening of anxiety. Q. Do people with eating disorders ever get better? Most patients move in and out of diagnostic categories so recovery statistics are hard to pin down. Nonetheless, the answer to the question is “Yes.” With treatment, people are able to minimize if not eliminate their dangerous behaviors as well as become more comfortable inside their bodies and around food. However, almost all find that feelings and thoughts about weight and food remain their Achilles Heel and pop up during times of stress. Thus, even recovered patients must remain alert for warning signs of slipping and actively protect their recovery. Q. If someone in your family has an eating disorder, what can you do? The first thing not to do is be the Food Police. What you should do is tell your loved one the behaviors you’ve noticed, that you are concerned, and you are wondering if s/he is feeling okay or needs help with anything. If s/he agrees that a problem has developed, encourage him/her to seek professional help. Your role as someone who loves that person is best protected and most useful if you let someone else be the therapist. Q. Why do you choose to work with people who have eating disorders? Easy question! Eating disorders occur in that space where the physical and the psychological most vividly connect. What and how you eat affects your brain which affects what you think and how you feel which affects what and how you eat, and so on. Thus, eating disorders are the toughest and most interesting of the conditions I treat. It is thrilling to help patients discover those intimate little spaces where their heads and hearts (mind and body) collide, collude, and ultimately collaborate to recover. Q. If you had one piece of advice for people with eating disorders, what would that be? Know that you are not alone in this disorder; you’re not a freak and you’re not weak. This is an illness that can be treated. Make an appointment with a mental health professional and start working on getting your life back. — Thank you, Dr. Wolfe.

 Eating disorders prevalent in anxiety patients by Liz Fox, RCPsych, Anxiety Insights Wednesday, 3 June 2009 Doctors and other health workers should be more aware of the high risk of eating disorders among people with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and other anxiety disorders. According to new research presented today at the Royal College of Psychiatrists' 2009 Annual Meeting, as many as one in five people with OCD could also have some form of disordered eating. In addition, disordered eating may occur in as many as one in three patients with other anxiety disorders. OCD is a serious anxiety-related condition that affects 2-3% of the adult population. People with severe OCD may find it difficult to work regularly, or even take part in their family or social life. Dr Lynne Drummond, a consultant psychiatrist at South West London and St George's NHS Mental Health Trust, collected data from a sample of patients with severe OCD who were referred to a specialist unit for treatment. A control group of patients with other anxiety disorders referred for treatment to the same unit was also studied. The study found that a fifth of the patients with OCD also had signs of disordered eating. The prevalance for those with other anxiety disorders was a one in three. Dr Drummond said: "Although these have been several studies examining the prevalence of OCD and obsessive symptoms in patients with eating disorders, there is a dearth of studies where patients with OCD and other anxiety disorders are examined for eating disorders. "This study suggests that clinicians should be made aware of the high prevalence of disordered eating in patients with all anxiety disorders as well as OCD." 
 Track Your Mindful Eating Moments By Pavel G. Somov, Ph.D. For years we’ve been asked to track what we eat and how much we eat. That’s all fine and good, but what about tracking how mindfully we eat? I encourage you to try tracking your mindful eating moments. First, set a simple goal: try to have one mindful eating moment per meal. Mindful eating is often misunderstood as a kind of all-or-nothing approach to eating, where you’d commit to eating mindfully and then you’d have to eat mindfully all the time. I think this is perfectionist overkill. I think of mindful eating as an alarm clock. A few moments of mindful eating is enough to wake up the eating zombie. After all, when we set an alarm-clock to go off in the morning, we don’t expect it to keep buzzing non-stop. Same with mindful eating: at a minimum, start the meal on a mindful note and appreciate the residual sense of presence. So, set a modest goal: say, one mindful or one savoring per meal. In other words, aim to have a few experiential calories. And then, when the meal is over, at some point, journal a bit about this moment of mindful eating. Most of us eat at least 3 times a day. Imagine if you got into a habit of having at least one mindful eating moment per meal – that’s over 1,000 precedents of mindful eating per year! You can also journal about lost eating moments – i.e. about the effects of mindless eating… Mindful eating isn’t a one-time choice – it’s a habit. Build the habit of conscious eating one mindful eating journal entry at a time. Mindful eating – as I have recently written – is a kind of yoga that unites your mind’s intention with your body’s eating behavior. As such, a mindful eating journal is also an opportunity for you… to rediscover yourself. Mindful eating moments are moments of intimacy and self-synchronization. When you document what you are consciously eating, you might also get a glimpse into what is eating you psychologically. Enough said. I think that the benefits of journaling about moments of conscious eating are self-evident (no pun intended). As for specifics, you can journal the classic way – pen + paper – or, since many of us are nowadays online, you could start an online journal (even possibly a live blog) devoted to your mindful eating. Alternatively, you can use Mindful Eating Tracker, a new free feature I am piloting on my site. Pavel Somov, Ph.D. is the author of Eating the Moment (New Harbinger, 2008), Present Perfect (NH, 2010), and The Lotus Effect (NH, 2010). He is in private practice.

 Down to the Bones: An Interview With Anorexia and Bulimia By Christie, NC State University February 26, 2010 The average woman sees 400-600 advertisements per day. By the time she is 17 years old, she has seen over 250,000 commercials. With the constant message of beauty and perfection reminding women every day of their flaws, many girls are self-conscious about their appearance, especially their weight. Unfortunately for some, that concern can grow into an obsession, and turn into an eating disorder. In the U.S. one out of every two people will have an eating disorder. The most common of these are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Sadly, we usually arent aware that someone we know has one until it is too late. My friend Tina (not her real name, obviously) suffered alternatively from anorexia and bulimia for years and she agreed to share her story. Her anorexia began when she was around eleven years old, and continued on and off. When she began to suffer from bulimia, she was fifteen. She used to {purge} after every meal, no matter how small it was. On average, that was about three to five times a day. All of this was so that she would reach her ideal weight of {weight deleted}, which is the weight she was in 7th and 8th grade. Tina said that before eating a meal, regardless of how hungry she was, she would feel guilty for eating. She would tell herself to go ahead and consume the food, as long as she {purged} afterward. While eating she would feel disgusted and bloated, and regret eating at all as soon as she finished. Because of this Tina says, sometimes I had to force myself to eat. It drove me crazy because I didnt want to, but I had to or I knew I would go to the hospital. Or if my family was making me, to please them. While eating out, so as not to feel as guilty about eating, she would usually order an appetizer or a salad. I was always thinking about how fat, stupid, or worthless I was. How imperfect I was. I would look at girls smaller than me and think of ways to get like them. It was a huge mind game for control. I wanted control of my body and how I looked. I hated it but I loved it all the same. When asked if she could do things normally, such as play sports and be active with her eating disorder, she admitted that she could, but not for extended periods of time. I was extremely weak, and often too fatigued to do much of anything. Because of constant mood swings and the amount of weight she was losing, people began to take notice of her eating disorder. Still, their reactions were surprising. Some people pitied me, and others told me to grow up. Only a handful of people have actually tried to be there for me. Eventually, Tina was hospitalized and was given medicine to help her reach a healthy weight. She reached {a healthier weight} and was released. For all intents and purposes, Tina is better, but its a never-ending cycle. Im honestly unaware of what Im doing if I revert back to old habits, which keeps me from seeking the help I need until Im already considered anorexic or bulimic again. But she is on the road to recovery. Tina consciously reminds herself daily of the damage she is doing to her body (her hair would come out in handfuls and her skin was white and pasty), and is attending counseling sessions. Tina believes that her biggest challenge she faces now would be overcoming her eating disorders completely. It is hard to really get past it and stay past it. I slip up quite a bit. Currently, I weigh 98 pounds. Being just 17 and 5 feet 4 inches, I know that is not a healthy weight. Tina offers this advice for girls struggling with eating issues: My advice would be to get help. No matter how much you dont want to or how much control you think you have over it, you dont. I thought I could control it, but I couldnt. I ended up with hypoglycemia because of it. So please, if you have an eating disorder, dont be stubborn, get help. To the girls with friends who are struggling, be there for them. Offer to help or be there when they ask for help from their parents, guidance counselors or whoever they feel comfortable asking. Be careful to be gentle with them though and not get frustrated because they dont listen right away or seem reluctant. Remember, when you have an eating disorder, your mind becomes fragile and you end up hurting everyone around you just as much as you are hurting your own body. There is no such thing as perfection. It is a figment of our imagination. Something far too complex for anyone to be, therefore, unreal. 
 You Dont Have to Be Anorexic To Have An Eating Disorder By Liza, Grove City College February 24, 2010 So maybe youve never gone more than 24 hours without food. Maybe youve never taken a laxative or made yourself throw up after eating too much. You dont have an Eating Disorder. But how much of your day is spent thinking about food? When you are out with friends, are you comparing what everyone else is eating to what you are eating, figuring out the calories instead of enjoying their company? Have you ever doubled your workouts to compensate for splurging on a slice of pizza? Can you barely even remember a time when you werent trying out the latest diet? You dont have to have an eating disorder to have an unhealthy relationship with food. Its called Disordered Eating and it can be emotionally draining, physically exhausting or even lead to a full blown Eating Disorder. Disordered Eating starts with a mentality rather than a behavior. If you are lucky to eat one real meal a day during finals week because you are so crazed trying to cram everything in, its not good for you, but its not a symptom of Disordered Eating. If you only eat one meal a day during finals week so you can at least be in control of your diet since everything else is so hectic, thats Disordered Eating. It can present itself in many ways, but here are a few of the most common. Diet Hopping: If you went from Slimfast to Atkins to South Beach to Master Cleanse, this can be a problem. If you dont even know what to eat unless you are following some set out regimented diet plan, and are constantly changing to find better results, you might want to evaluate your motivations. Exercise Binging: Do you count calories as they go in AND as they go out? Those very clever machines at the gym that tell you how many calories you are burning are useful, but if you obsessively exercise to burn off all the calories you consumed that day, thats dangerous. It can ultimately lead to Exercise Bulimia which involves using intense workouts to purge instead of vomiting or laxatives. Hidden Eating: Do you order a salad with your friends, but grab the bag of Oreos once you are back to your room? Have you ever lied to someone about what you ate that day? If you feel ashamed of eating in front of people theres definitely something wrong with the way you see food. Eating should be a natural part of your life. Food should not feel like your enemy and should not be constantly on your mind. If you have exhibited these behaviors you are not alone. Not too long ago, SELF Magazine conducted a survey that found 65% of those polled displayed some type of Disordered Eating. The most important thing to remember is that to truly be in control of your eating habits, you cant let them control YOU. Being aware of the problem is the first step to freeing yourself from being constantly consumed with thoughts of food. Dont be afraid to get help; being open about it is the best way to make sure it doesnt get worse. Talk to friends, or find a support group. START a support group if you cant find one. Chances are a lot of your friends are in the same situation. Stop the problem before it gets worse. This really can develop into a life or death situation. 
 Embodied Eating, Part 1 Psychology Today blog: Body Sense by Alan Fogel, PhD October 20, 2009 The Experience of Food: Suppression or Sensation? By all measures, eating disorders are epidemic in industrialized nations. The rise of the middle class in N. America, Europe, India, China, and Japan has apparently brought with it conditions that create opportunities for the overuse and misuse of food. On the one hand, there is the year-round world-wide availability of a huge diversity of food, including highly processed foods. There is increased pressure on families to work more to maintain their middle-class standard of living that leads to less free time and an increasing reliance on fast food containing high levels of salts, sugars, fats, and carbohydrates. The consumption of consumer appliances, computers, televisions, and video games means that recreation has turned increasingly indoors, become sedentary, and has the effect of numbing the body and its sensations as one is engaged in these activities. This sociocultural process has been especially hard on youth with a dramatic worldwide rise in pediatric obesity and adolescent eating disorders. Pediatric obesity can lead to early onset type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and predispose the individual to adult obesity. In eating disorders, food is used as a way to suppress the body sense including unwanted emotions such as frustration and discouragement, and the signs of stress including muscle tension, fatigue, and pain. There are two basic eating strategies to suppress the body sense: either to eat too much or eat too little. In the case of those who eat too little, they are focused more on external images of the ideal body or behaving in accordance with peer group expectations. They are excessively pre-occupied with being negatively evaluated because of the way they look, and the stress of performance suppresses their own body sense about what is good and healthy for themselves. Eating too little can become chronic in the case of anorexia nervosa (self-starvation). Anorexic teens show a typical profile of emotional suppression, in which higher levels of sympathetic nervous system arousal occur in the body with the person showing little or no awareness of their internal state. Those who eat too much focus on the food itself. If food is present, no matter what type of food, they are likely to indulge in eating it. They suppress body sense awareness required for homeostatic regulation of food intake, such as the feeling of satiety, or gastrointestinal distress and indigestion. Individuals who suffer from obesity are also less able to feel pleasurable sensations from the taste of food compared to others, due to a possible genetically-linked impairment of dopamine receptors in the brain, resulting in overconsumption of foods high in fats and sugars in order to be able to feel satisfied. Binge eating has been linked to life stress coupled with suppression of body sensations and emotions, and negative mood in a wide range of populations and in many different research studies. Either filling up with too much food or entering a state of semi-starvation create changes in the peripheral receptors of the homeostatic body systems that lead to particular states such as feeling soporific or energizing, depressive or anxious. Clinical case reports reveal that these states actually suppress the body sense, the underlying feelings of loneliness, loss, and trauma from which the food or starvation "high" becomes a palliative. For optimal health and rejuvenation, we all need exercise, rest, time to our body sense and feel deeply into ourselves, and meaningful and emotionally expressive human contact. Under stress, however, these "needs" can be easily ignored. We do, however, have to eat. It's required. When done using our full body sense, eating not only satisfies hunger and nutritional needs, but it can become a highly pleasurable and renewing experience. Using your body sense to eat starts at the market. How do you go about buying food? Are you looking for something prepared, easy, quick, and cheap? Is your shopping for food in-and-out? Do you think about where and how the food was grown? If you take a few extra minutes, you can have a wonderfully sensual experience in the market and later at home when you prepare the food. Fresh fruits and vegetables come in great varieties of colors, tastes, textures, and smells. Can you let your choices be guided by all your senses, not just your economic sense of value or your conceptual thoughts about what seems easiest or most habitual. First Lady Michelle Obama recently visited a new farmer's market located only blocks from the White House. Mrs. Obama encouraged Americans to get to know the people who grow their food. She said that farmers markets are especially important in neighborhoods where access to healthy options are limited. Mrs Obama has been speaking out for healthy eating since planting the White House vegetable garden in the spring. Buying and preparing food using your body sense can be restorative: the zen of shopping and chopping. You have to eat, right? Maybe you don't have time to meditate or exercise or get a massage but you can use this necessity of eating to pull you back into your body and its senses. This connection to and through food can be expanded if you share foraging, cooking, and eating with friends and family. Food brings people together like nothing else, especially if your life is otherwise spent away from these cherished people. Research shows that having regular family mealtimes increases child health and promotes social and cognitive development, in part because of the shared activity that accompanies eating slowly and with other's watching. Like all forms of body sense awareness in the subjective emotional present, practicing Slow Food techniques will nourish your senses with pleasure and purpose, sending cascades of mood elevating neurotransmitters and hormones through your system. So, what may seem like an unnecessary break from your chores will actually recharge your batteries so you can go back to work with more energy and enthusiasm than before. Alan Fogel is a Professor of Psychology at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. His most recent book is The Psychophysiology of Self-Awareness: Rediscovering the Lost Art of Body Sense. 
 Is there a difference between an eating disorder and an addiction to food (or an overeater)? Thanks in advance 
 The other day I felt strong, strong enough to buy myself a book on anorexia and read it without feeling the pull toward going back into the disorder. I felt that I would be able to use the information in the book to help myself in my recovery, to help me understand what it is all about. I bought the book GAINING: The truth about life after eating disorders by Aimee Liu. When I bought this book I had no idea what the impact was going to be. Although I have not reached the half point of the book I have to say WOW!! - I am truly impressed. It is an amazing book that has stories about many girls who have suffered with eating disorder and their way to recovery - how they made it through and how they are living now if they have truly recovered or simply changed the habit. I recommend this book for whoever is in recovery because it helps you see the things you need to do to get better, the things you can try that may be helpful to you. It also gives everyone a true idea what the disorder is. The book is also full of statistical information that helps you understand what happened to those in the book but also understand better what went on with yourself as you can relate to some of the women in the book.

 Overeating and the Amygdala by Dr. Deborah Serani Tuesday, July 28, 2009 Okay, now, don't go using this an an all-out excuse to have a hot fudge sundae for breakfast tomorrow morning.... but research keeps pointing to neurobiology as a major cause for the urge to overeat. According to Dr. David Kessler and Passamonti et al., overeating is a biological challenge, not a character flaw. For most people, when they see a tempting snack like a potato chip, the area of the brain called the Amygdala lights up with activity and sends feelings of anticipation and desire. And once they start eating, the region shuts down. But for an overeater the Amygdala remains activated while eating, creating that feeling of want and coaxing the desire even after 5, 10 or even 50 cookies. This can explain why some who've had gastric bypass find the weight creeping back on. Why others are hungry "all the time". Or why chocoholics like me can't seem to get enough Cadbury in a week. The Amygdala is also connected to emotional regulation and addiction - suggesting that much is knotted in this brain region. I've always marveled at my mother-in-law who can have one cookie and be satisfied. Or a forkful of cake. Or stop at one potato chip. Yes, that's right. One potato chip. Her Amygdala regulates way better than mine. But I am way better at Scrabble than she is. So there. Reference Passamonti, L., Rowe, J., Schwarzbauer, C., Ewbank, M., von dem Hagen, E., & Calder, A.

 The Imperfect Eating Disorder By DANA WALTERS, New York Times July 26, 2009 In high school, I was a skeleton of who I am now. With pangs of hunger and a jutting rib cage, I was waiting for confidence and determination to flesh me out, fill me and protect me. The story of eating disorders, of young girls starving themselves for the sake of perfection, is a common one, written on the bathroom walls amid the graffiti of rumors and insults. Despite its ubiquity in high school, I believed my hunger was mine alone. Only later did I discover just how truly commonplace my story was. My eating disorder did not make me special. Only curing myself would. I grew up in Swarthmore, Pa., a town not unlike Middlebury, Vt., where I now attend school, but I still thought the substitution of the Green Mountains for the Philadelphia skyline would be just enough to drastically shift my unbalanced psyche. But the deeply instilled sense of overwork and suicidal efficiency still flourished. In Swarthmore, it dotted the driveways of professors, lawyers and doctors, gave nourishment to the soil along the streets named after the most competitive universities in the nation, and resonated in the enthusiasm with which parents flipped through the college announcement edition of the town paper. My new environment, it turned out, was much the same. When I arrived at Middlebury, the beautiful New England buildings screamed of the same hunger for achievement. The competition for perfection was not over. Students glowed with the masochism that drove us to fast ourselves into oblivion. Surprisingly, I did not react by spiraling downward. Instead, I saw these new students as ghosts of my former self, their transparent qualities pieces I never wanted to resurrect. One girls constant jabber about how much she ate reminded me of my old false lies of fullness. Complaints of distended blubber on stick-thin girls reminded of my old internal fun-house mirror. More than ever before, I was in the immediate and constant presence of the disordered mentality that had stolen two years of my life, but in a different way. Instead of its befuddled existence within my own mind, I saw its ugly manipulation for what it was. Living among these ruins, I renewed my devotion to a better life. When people ask me where I go to school, I say, Swarthmore in Vermont. But where Swarthmore is what I used to be, where I never noticed the beauty around me because I was too busy counting calories, at Middlebury I count the roses. In the end, the location was unimportant. This newfangled vigor I feel  some call it real living  was a result of my readiness for transformation. I had tricked myself into believing that college would flip the world upside-down, allowing me to become a new person. I did grow and I am stronger now, but not because this new land fixed me. Instead, college meant the opportunity to believe I could change, even if the air was still pretty much the same. No matter the reason, I breathe better here than I ever did before. 
 Orthorexia - When eating healthy goes awry By Jennifer Nelson, M.S., R.D. and Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., Mayo Clinic July 11, 2009 Everyone can benefit by paying more attention to choosing healthy foods, right? For the most part, yes. However, a small number of people become obsessed with the "perfect diet." Orthorexia nervosa - which means fixation on righteous eating - is a term that has been coined to describe this behavior. If you have orthorexia, you fixate on eating foods that make you feel pure and healthy. You may avoid many foods, including those made with: Artificial colors, flavors or preservativesPesticides or genetic modificationUnhealthy fat, sugar or salt You may also be overly concerned with preparation techniques  for example, food must be washed multiple times and utensils must be sterilized. You probably also avoid eating food that you didn't buy and prepare. According to Dr. Steven Bratman  the physician who first described and named this disorder  individuals with orthorexia find that their food obsessions begin to hinder everyday activities. Their strict rules and beliefs about food may lead them to become socially isolated. These individuals may also become intolerant of other people's views about food and health. Although orthorexia is not an officially recognized eating disorder, most experts agree that this kind of obsession isn't healthy. If striving for a healthy diet becomes an overwhelming drive that takes over your life, seek help. Orthorexia can be treated with counseling and medication. 
 When Eating Becomes Disordered by Stacy Beller Stryer, M.D. May 7th, 2009 I was thumbing through the newspaper today while my teen was eating breakfast before school. Watching her measure out a serving size of cereal just for the fun of it makes me a tad bit nervous, considering she doesnt have an ounce of fat on her. I quickly searched for the health section  it gives me an idea of what my patients will ask about during the work day (such as the swine flu), and it can also be a good starting point for blog ideas. The front page of the health section Tuesday had a picture and quote from a beautiful teen who had died of bulimia several years ago. She looked familiar. My eyes scanned down to the name below the quote, and upon recognizing the name, my eyes immediately welled with tears. She had been my patient years ago, and I didnt know she died. She was a great, sweet, smart teen who was well aware of her bulimia and the possible consequences. And she died. At the very least, eating disorders can ruin their own lives and those of their families. And they kill. Although statistics vary based on the study, about 0.5% to 1% of teens and women in the United States have anorexia nervosa, an illness that involves significant weight loss and food refusal. About 1% to 3% of young American women have bulimia, a condition that includes regular binging and purging. Over 1 million males have an eating disorder and the numbers are climbing. Eating disorders are difficult to treat, especially once a pattern has been established and it has become a way of life. The earlier they are recognized, the more likely treatment will be successful. These days, children have unrealistic expectations of what they should look like and how much they should weigh. Think about it. Their role models have changed dramatically over the past several decades. Girls and teens are exposed to ultra-thin, beautiful women wherever they turn  on TV, in magazines, music videos, and movies. And if that werent enough, moms, aunts, sisters and other teens and adults they know talk about food all the time  about eating too much, counting their calories, watching their weight, feeling fat. Its no wonder that almost one-half of first through third grade girls want to be thinner and that over 80% of 10 year olds are afraid of being fat! Our countrys obsession with food and its trickling down effect is readily apparent when we look at the results of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey for middle schoolers, a survey conducted in 10 states in 2005 (see end of blog) . By 6th grade, almost half of the students surveyed were trying to lose weight (even though only 14 to 18% were actually overweight), 5 to 7% vomited or took laxatives due to weight concerns, and 10 to 20% didnt eat for at least 24 hours because they wanted to lose or didnt want to gain weight! And we cant forget that boys develop eating disorders, too. They tend to be diagnosed later than girls, possibly because we arent expecting to see males develop these illnesses. What can we do? Society must take some responsibility for the large number of teens and adults with eating disorders. Genetics appears to play a role also. While these factors are out of our control, others are not. First of all, we can build our childrens self-esteem and confidence with regards to their academic and moral aptitude, rather than their outer appearance. We can make sure that we dont discuss weight and eating around our children and that we act as good role models by eating well and maintaining a normal weight. We can limit TV, movies, and fashion magazines in our home and spend time together as a family. We can try to make our expectations for our children realistic and feasible. We can watch our children and teens closely for signs of an eating disorder, particularly if they are involved in sports, such as ballet, gymnastics, and wrestling, which focus on specific body types. And, if we are concerned about them, we can immediately make an appointment for them to be seen by their pediatrician and therapist to be weighed and to discuss any concerns. I can assure you it wont be a wasted visit, even if your child turns out to have a healthy weight and eating habits. Dont ignore signs of an eating disorder, as one of my patients did in the past. Upon hearing that her daughter weighed a mere 70% of her ideal body weight, her mom said that she was fine and that she, too, had gone through a similar phase when she was a teen. Eating disorders are real, and they kill. 
 I was hospitalized with anorexia some 5 years ago. Since then I got treatment with two or three therapists for about 3-4 years. During that time I had 2 relapses (weight loss and disordered eating) and an extended period of partial remission where I would sometimes still purge or skip meals (but no significant weight loss). I'm "ok" now....but...how can I be expected to recover if none of my therapists have ever dealt with my body issues? I'm at a risk of relapsing now because I'm getting bothered with my "normal" body. I can't stand myself in anything tight, meaning I can't wear jeans without wearing a very loose and long shirt covering everything, and I can't wear shorts of a skirt anymore because my legs are too fat for me. I get that it may just be in my head, that I can't be too picky about my body, but honestly - I can't stand not doing anything about it, and so losing weight seems like the logical thing to do. I feel trapped, and I want to wear normal clothes, but that will only happen if I lose 2 more kgs, and then 2 more and so on and so on. And yet none of my therapists have ever tried to approach this. I KNOW I'm not "fat", but I still feel too big. So how am I supposed to be expected to be all healthy and stuff if I feel this way about my body? I'm supposed to start taking calcium for osteopenia, but I'm very reluctant to do so...because in my head gaining any sort of mass (even if it's supposed to be good for me, like in my bones) is not a good thing. I'd rather be a few hundred grams lighter at the expense of my bones...which makes absolutely no sense! So I don't know how I'm supposed to be healthy if I still can't get past this thing. Has anybody ever had treatment concerning their body image? How does it work? Did it help? 
 OVERCOMING AN EATING DISORDER: A STORY OF HOPE AND COURAGE Freedom From Fear March 2009 Eating disorders are not a choice, but a disease. For everyone that has or currently struggles with an eating disorder the journey is different. My journey started in the seventh grade as a diet that eventually took on a life of its own. With the help of supportive friends and family, along with a team of medical professionals and a lot of courage and hope, I was able to recover from my struggle with Anorexia. I was lucky to recover and in the process uncover a passion to help others as my therapist, nutritionist and doctor had helped me. This is my story of hope and courage. My struggle with Anorexia began during the fall of seventh grade. I had just started a new school and along with that new school came a new popular best friend, Sarah, whom I constantly compared myself to. One day while sitting in chorus class I remember Sarah telling me Julie, more guys would definitely like you if you lost a little weight. Lets both do it and see who can lose the most weight. From the beginning of our unhealthy friendship, Sarah had always been better than me, she had better grades, was prettier and more popular. For once I wanted to be better than Sarah at something. I had never been on a diet before and did not know how to lose weight in a healthy manner. My plan was simple, I would throw away my breakfast on the bus, skip lunch to do homework and then eat as little as possible at dinner without getting noticed. For the first couple of months this plan worked. I lost a lot of weight and got compliments from everyone around me saying how great I looked. I may have looked great but I did not feel that way. Not only did I still feel fat, but I had no energy to do anything and could not concentrate in school. I spent most of my days in the nurses office complaining of one ailment after another. No matter how little I ate or how much weight I lost I still didnt feel good enough. My ultimate goal of weight loss had been far exceeded. I thrived on the control not eating gave me. About six months into my diet Sarah told me it was too hard to watch me do this to myself and I had taken it too far. Sarah said she could not be my friend until I got better. I was devastated. I went on starving myself for months. I would make up excuses and lies to everyone around me. My main concern was to lose weight and I did not care who I hurt in the process. About eight months into my eating disorder I could no longer hide my weight loss and physical symptoms. At my annual checkup my doctor discovered my eating disorder. At this point, part of me was ready to stop hurting myself and lying to those around me, but there was also a part of me that was scared to let go of what I had become dependant on. The hard work began as I was sent to a variety of professionals who would help me during my recovery process. My recovery team consisted on my medical doctor, a therapist and a nutritionist. Together they monitored my health, retrained my thought process about food and re-taught me how to eat in a healthy way. Recovery was not easy and many days I fell back into my old ways of not eating. The hardest part of recovery was retraining my mind to think about food in a healthy way, rather than as something destructive. Even now I have days where it is hard to eat normal food, but recovery is a lifelong process that gets easier everyday. As Anna Freud wrote, I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence, but it comes from within. It is there all the time. I view my eating disorder as a negative thing that had a positive outcome. Struggling and recovering from my eating disorder helped me to discover a passion to help others and a desire to become a therapist. I hope to use my knowledge and passion to become therapist that specializes in the treatment of eating disorders. This article was written by an intern at Freedom From Fear.

 Eating disorders may be rising among male athletes Thursday, January 8, 2009 By Anne Harding NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - More and more male athletes are developing unhealthy eating behaviors after seeing the competitive advantage a leaner physique can bring, a sports medicine doctor warns in a new report. Recent deaths among wrestlers have raised awareness of eating disorders and their potentially deadly consequences among male athletes, but Dr. James L. Glazer told Reuters Health he's increasingly seeing problematic eating behavior among men engaged in other sports at the recreational level, such as cyclists, triathletes and Nordic skiers. Eating problems may first arise in a recreational athlete when he loses a few pounds as a result of training, explained Glazer, of the Maine Medical Center in Portland. "Often he'll notice that he's getting faster and that his placement when he competes is getting higher and better," he added. "That will change what is a good and a healthy dieting pattern into one that becomes a little problematic and dangerous." Eventually, Glazer noted, a man may lose so much weight that his performance starts to suffer. Seeing this change for the worse may be enough to convince him to change his habits for the better, he added. "Many men can turn things around just with a little bit of increased awareness about nutrition and healthy weight," Glazer said. However, men with body dysmorphic disorder, who see themselves as overweight even if they are emaciated, may come up with other reasons for their drop in performance, and resist the idea that they have a problem. "Those can be very difficult cases to treat," Glazer commented. Anyone with an eating disorder should see a nutritionist and either a psychologist or psychiatrist, he advised. "Sometimes medications are appropriate and helpful and sometimes athletes get into so much trouble with unhealthy eating that they need to be hospitalized, but that's a real minority." Glazer acknowledged that while the current emphasis on fighting obesity and inactivity has been of great benefit to public health, it may also have led many health professionals to overlook the potential for eating disorders in men who are too thin and perhaps even too active. Also, he added, there is currently no established consensus on when it is safe for a male athlete with a history of disordered eating to return to his sport.

 Therapy hope for eating disorders BBC News December 15, 2008 More people with eating disorders could benefit from "talking therapies" which aim to release them from obsessive feelings, say UK researchers. They said a specially-created form of cognitive behavioural therapy might work in four out of five cases. A 154-person American Journal of Psychiatry study, by the University of Oxford, found most achieved "complete and lasting" improvement. At present, the treatment is officially recommended only for bulimia patients. Some statistics suggest that more than a million people in the UK are affected by some kind of eating disorder, the best known types being anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Approximately 40% of those with eating disorders have bulimia, 20% have anorexia, and the remainder have "atypical disorders", which can combine both bulimic and anorexic-type symptoms. The National Institute of Clinical Excellence has backed cognitive behavioural therapy for bulimia, but Professor Christopher Fairburn, the Wellcome Trust funded researcher who led the project, believes his version could help many more people. His study focused on bulimia and "atypical" patients, but excluded those with anorexia. The technique works using a series of counselling sessions which help the person involved to realise the links between their emotions and behaviour, and work out ways to change what they are doing. Self-esteem Professor Fairburn developed two versions specifically for people with eating disorders, one which focused completely on the eating problems, and another, which took a wider view of not only the eating disorder, but also problems with self-esteem which might be contributing to it. Both treatments involved 50-minute outpatient sessions repeated once a week for 20 weeks. Afterwards, the researchers found most patients had responded well, and that this improvement was maintained over the next year - a time during which relapse into eating disorder is most likely to occur. Two-thirds made a "complete and lasting" response, with many of the other third showing substantial improvement. Although the study did not specifically include people with anorexia, a second study, currently underway, is showing promising results in this group. No hospital Professor Fairburn said: "Now, for the first time, we have a single treatment which can be effective at treating the majority of cases, without the need for patients to be admitted into hospital. "It is increasingly being used across the NHS, and has the potential to improve the lives of the hundreds of thousands of people living with eating disorders." Susan Muir is one person who says that CBT techniques have helped free her of a long-term eating disorder. The 39-year-old, from Chesterfield, used diet and exercise to shed 13 stone, but found that once this had happened, she found herself binge-eating then obsessively exercising. "The CBT helped me realise what I was doing, and turned those irrational thoughts into rational ones. "It really helped me deal with my self-esteem problems and made me feel very positive." Susan Ringwood, the chief executive of Beat, the eating disorders campaign group, said: "This research shows that people can benefit from psychological therapy even at a very low weight. "There has been so little research into eating disorders and anorexia in particular, and this has really added to our knowledge in a challenging field." Dr Alan Cohen, mental health spokesperson for the Royal College of GPs, welcomed the research. He said: "Access to this service, and appropriate training for therapists to deliver this new form of treatment, is very important." 
 Its funny to here someone say they are recovered when you know that its only a begining and recover doesn't always mean your fine, im not fine you I always still struggle with anorexia and bulimia I can't say that i don't eat and purge or even think about it alot, or skip meals or take large amount of diet pills so tell me what is recovered. Im still recovering right. just strollin in those midnight exercise dances and everyday and fumigating wieghts.. Im not recovered because I still think about it everyday and night

 From CNN.com KENNESAW, Georgia (CNN) -- The sweet smell of sugar cookies baking filled the air in Kris Shock's kitchen. Kris Shock, who once struggled with bulimia, enjoys cookies with her son, Drew. She pulled a tray from the oven and sat down with her 9-year-old son, Drew, to frost the treats. Then, Shock did something that might have been unthinkable for her a few years ago. She took a bite of a cookie. Shock, 36, of Kennesaw, Georgia, spent most of her adolescence and early adulthood struggling with bulimia and an addiction to diet pills. Long holiday seasons were always the worst, Shock said, as she dealt with the stress of trying to create a picture-perfect Thanksgiving and Christmas for her family. "I would be emotionally and physically exhausted come the New Year, and I would have no memories to show for it other than sheer anxiety," Shock recalled. "I would be acting out at every moment, whether that was using diet pills, taking laxatives or restrictive behavior, whatever I used to cope at that moment." Now in recovery, Shock approaches the holidays and all that tempting food with a bit of trepidation. "I always keep in mind that relapse is potentially possible if I don't do the right things," Shock said. "For me, that is being honest with myself, knowing that tomorrow I may have to pick up the phone and call a nutritionist ... or call my therapist." That's just what some experts recommend, including Cynthia Bulik, director of the University of North Carolina Eating Disorders Program. "For some people, the holiday season is filled with joyous occasions and wonderful food," Bulik said. "For other people, it can actually be quite a nightmare ... especially if you have eating disorders." Bulik is busy these days helping her patients figure out how to navigate all the stress-inducing holiday parties and family gatherings. She tells people with eating disorders, "Keep your support team on speed dial." Bulik targeted her advice to people who suffer from anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder in which people develop an aversion to food, lose a lot of weight and are afraid of gaining weight. "It can be incredibly overwhelming to be surrounded by so many different types of food," Bulik noted. "We often suggest that people with anorexia go to a party with a wingman. ... Take someone with you who is safe, to whom you can say, 'This is really tough for me. I need to take a break.' " She shared similar advice for those who suffer from bulimia, a condition in which people binge and purge. "We tell people to never go to a party hungry. ... That's the worst thing to do. It's really best to have a decent meal before you get there so you're not tempted to binge when you're at the party," Bulik recommended. One of Shock's biggest challenges while recovering from bulimia was coping with probing family members. "It was very anxiety-filled," Shock recalled, "I had to eat dinner with all these people where, many times, there were unspoken things I wanted to say." Last Christmas, Shock tried a new strategy: eating dinner with her husband and children first and then attending a party. Shock called it a safer situation. "I can take care of my physical body and then handle the process, the emotional anxiety that comes with typical social situations," she said. Bulik advises well-meaning family members to try to help people with eating disorders feel as comfortable as possible. "There is no play book," she said. "The best thing to do is not to push. ... Don't focus on their appearance, don't focus on what they're eating." Another complication may occur when someone with an eating disorder must step into the chef's role and prepare dinner for a crowd. Bulik advised, "If it is too tough to prepare that meal for 20 people that year, call in some help. Get takeout for a change. Do something that is easier for you. Don't always feel like you have to be the perfect hostess, because that can be the first step toward relapse." Shock is taking the advice to heart. Remember the sugar cookies she was frosting with her son? Rather than stress out about making them from scratch, she bought the slice-and-bake version at the supermarket. She figured she'd have more fun spending the extra time with her son. "Take care of yourself," she advised. "You will feel empowered."

 An Introduction to Eating Disorders Australian Institute of Professional Counsellors Eating disorders are complex, multifaceted physical and mental health problems. Their development usually involves a number of different contributing and perpetuating factors. The exact processes are unclear and it is uncertain how they interact to develop or maintain an eating disorder (Fairburn & Harrison, 2003). Contributing factors could include one or a combination of physical, emotional or sexual trauma; cultural emphasis on body image ideals; peer influences; loss and grief; brain chemistry; physiological effects of dieting, starvation or purging behaviours; relationship issues; stress; and maladaptive coping skills. The complexity of eating disorders means there are no simple solutions. Development of an Eating Disorder There are many environmental, cultural, psychological and biological factors which combine in different ways in the development of an eating disorder. These factors can be divided into 3 factors  see the Model of Development and Maintenance of an Eating Disorder, by Garner & Garfinkel. Important factors which predispose a person to developing an eating disorder include being female, living in Western society, being an adolescent, having low self-esteem, perfectionism, and/or depression, and having a family history of any type of eating disorder, obesity, depression, or substance abuse. Significant precipitating factors which may trigger the disorder include dieting to lose weight, occupational or recreational pressures to be slim, critical comments about weight and shape, and sexual abuse. Key factors which maintain the disorder once it has developed primarily involve the psychological, emotional, and physical effects of starvation. Stages of an Eating Disorder Lemberg (1992) also proposes a model of development whereby a person moves from voluntary dieting through a number of stages to reach a fully entrenched eating disorder. Stage 1: Normal, voluntary dieting behaviour. Unfortunately dieting behaviours have become the norm, with 47% of people in Australia having tried to lose weight in the past twelve months. 68% of fifteen year old girls are dieting at any one time, 8% of these are on a severe diet (Lemberg, 1992). While these diets are severe enough to be considered an eating disorder, they are unhealthy and result in rapid weight changes, disrupted metabolism, dehydration, low energy and lack of essential vitamins, minerals and nutrients. Stage 1B: (Bulimia Nervosa). The hunger associated with dieting and restriction leads to severe and constant cravings, which result in loss of control and overcompensation by bingeing on large amounts of food. Stage 2: A Diagnosable Disorder. At this stage the dieting behaviour has become a diagnosable mental illness according to the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual IV-TR (APA, 2000). At this stage there are serious consequences and a morbid fear of fatness, and the dieting is no longer under the persons control. However the person is unable to see the negative consequences and is in denial of the eating disorder. In bulimia nervosa the bingeing behaviours, rather than being due to dietary restriction, occur more generally as a result of stress or negative emotional states. Stage 3A: Autonomous Behaviour. At this stage the person is generally able to see there is a problem, but as the behaviours are no longer under the persons control, the disorder does not resolve even if precipitating conditions have been resolved. Stage 3B: Illness becomes the identity. At this stage, rather than the eating disorder behaviours being a solution to a problem, the person now identifies him or herself only with the eating disorder and has difficulty separating themselves from the illness. The eating disorder behaviours are now constant rather than used as coping strategies, and the person feels they are nothing without their illness. They identify with being the illness, i.e. I am anorexic, rather than I have anorexia. The prospect of giving up the disorder can lead to existential fears of nothingness. Recovery requires not only finding alternative coping strategies, but helping the person identify themselves without the eating disorder.

 The Voices of Eating Disorders New York Times Blog October 15, 2008 In a country where many people struggle with eating too much, it can be hard to understand a disorder in which people basically starve themselves. In the latest Patient Voices, my colleague Karen Barrow explores the daily challenges of men and women battling anorexia, bulimia and other eating disorders.

 Eating Disorders in Men by Margarita Tartakovsky, MS October 7, 2008 When we think of eating disorders, we rarely picture a man working out obsessively, starving himself to look lean or wanting to emulate celebrities on magazine covers. For years, eating disorders have been viewed as a white womans disease. And estimates of male eating disorders told a similar story: while the majority of women suffered from eating disorders, only about 10 percent of men did. Recent research, however, paints a different, bigger picture: more men are suffering from eating disorders than previously thought. Out of 3,000 people with anorexia and bulimia, 25 percent were men (and 40 percent had binge eating disorder), according to a Harvard study. What distinguishes men with eating disorders from their female counterparts? Symptoms: The diagnostic criteria for anorexia, for instance, focus on women, which is evident in its hallmark symptoms of amenorrhea (the absence of menstruation) and fear of fatness. Though some men do exhibit a fear of fat, others typically want to be muscular (particularly their chest and arms), obsess over attaining a low body fat percentage and focus their efforts on excelling at a sport (which prompts some to abuse steroids and exercise excessively). Instead of engaging in traditional compensatory behaviors like vomiting or abusing laxatives, men instead are more likely to exercise compulsively (as cited in Weltzin, Weisensel, Franczyk, Burnett, Klitz & Bean, 2005).Images and ideals: For decades, women have been inundated with unrealistic, thin images in magazines, movies, ads and other media outlets. And now, men are also feeling the pressure for physical perfection, surrounded by unattainable images of muscular physiques, six-pack abs, bulging biceps and lean bodies. But, in contrast to women, where the images are one size fits all (thin is always in), men have a variety of images to emulate, psychiatrist Arnold Andersen, M.D., told The Wall Street Journal: Some want to be wiry like Mick Jagger; some want to be lean like David Beckham, and some want to be really buff and bulked, like Arnold Schwarzenegger.Interestingly, reports that wiry images are contributing to eating disorders have prompted one fashion show to ban thin male models with a BMI below 19 or 26 and 28 inch waists, UKs Telegraph reported this Monday. Dieting: Men might diet for different reasons than women, including (as cited in Greenberg & Schoen, 2008): to prevent weight gain (many eating disordered men were overweight as kids).excel in sports. According to an article on CBS News: Athletes whose weight is crucial to their performance - jockeys, wrestlers, distance runners and gymnasts - have a higher incidence of eating disorders. [Co-author of Making Weight] Cohn said they can develop bad habits when weight loss is seen as a requirement of the sport.avoid health complications.improve appearance after childhood teasing.for their jobs. Dr. Andersen told The Washington Post: Other patients include men who began dieting to meet job requirements  and couldnt stop. Weve had a number of military people like colonels, said Andersen, who was formerly on the staffs of Johns Hopkins Hospital and the National Institutes of Health. The military is very strict, and theyre afraid theyre going to get chucked out or fail to win a promotion if they dont lose weight to meet certain requirements. Not surprisingly, these differences make it harder for professionals to diagnose eating disorders in men. And, oftentimes men are unaware that theyre suffering from an eating disorder in the first place. In homosexual men Eating disorders are more prevalent in gay and bisexual men than in heterosexual men (Feldman & Meyer, 2007), though one expert attributes the higher prevalence to a greater likelihood to seek treatment. Either way, some have pointed to the increased emphasis on physical attractiveness in gay communities as a contributing factor, whereas others view participation in these communities as protection against eating disorders (as cited in Feldman et. al, 2007). Why now? Unfortunately, we cant confirm the reasons behind this increase in male eating disorders. Its uncertain whether more men are actually developing eating disorders today or if more men are coming forward. Barriers to treatment Stigma: Since eating disorders are known as a womans disease, men might be embarrassed to seek treatment, worried that theyd be seen as less of a man.Services: Because male eating disorders have only recently received attention, many treatment centers dont have separate services that treat men. Resources List of centers: Fortunately, treatment facilities that focus on men do exist. These centers include: Rogers Memorial Hospital, Oconomowoc, WIRiver Oaks Hospital, New Orleans, LAThe Eating Disorder Program at University of Iowa in Iowa City, IACenter for Eating Disorders at Sheppard Pratt, Baltimore, MAReddStone, Remuda Ranch for BoysFor more information, you can find resources at Eating Disorders in Men - Information on Eating Disorders - Bulimia - Anorexia.

 I hardly even eat anything, just because I am not hungry. I'm not anorexic. {Edit: potential trigger of numbers}}. That sounds huge, no? I've been trying to lose weight for forever (in a healthy way), but all I do is gain weight. I don't eat a lot of junk food. I hate being so huge compared to every other girl who is shorter than me AND thinner. I think the so-called "benefits" of being tall are crap. I don't wear any color besides black because it is a slimming color. I don't carry my weight in an attractive way at all, because it is mostly in my stomach and thighs. (Which btw makes my breasts look smaller)........I need advice. 
 My husband says that he will work on his eating disorder (he has ruminating syndrome) if I go back to him. We have been separated for 2 months. If I don't go back to him he won't work on it because he says that the regurgitation doesn't bother him. Does that comment make you wonder if he is really committed to fixing his problem if I reconcile with him? Should I trust him? 
 I've heard that people who have AD/HD tend to overeat, particularly certain types of food. Apparently, this has something to do with a lack of dopamine and it's effect on leptin & appetite control. Again, a lot of bio-chemistry, but I'm trying to understand all the facets of this disorder. I know that when I start feeling crappy, if I eat a lot, I start feeling better. Ice cream, french fries, basically all the stuff thats really not good for us. I also noticed that the more down I feel, the more hungry I get, sort of like after smoking a fat one & getting the munchies afterwards. (Yes, I did inhale back when I was a young man and I still remember it so I must not have done it for long!) When I was young, I could eat what ever I wanted, because I was so hyper, I just burned it off. When I was in the Air Force, before I got kicked out for unadaptability,( should have been a wake up call to get help) I could eat 5 meals a day & still weighed only 135 lbs at 5ft 10 in. Now I'm 235 & I think gravity is starting to make me shorter & wider. Anyway, I know also from the one time I was on Ritalin that I wasn't hungry anymore, even though I was even more depressed. That really sucked because for the first time in over 20 years I could look down & see something other than my stomach but I just couldn't seem to get very enthusiastic about it. Do any others of you out there who are dealing with the infinite joys of AD/HD have any experience with the constant desire to eat? How do you deal with it? I know it may not be a great idea but I'm going to go have a brownie & wait until somebody posts back. ( Ar Ar Huumor!) Joe 
 My husband has a very rare eating disorder called rumination syndrome. I can't begin to tell everyone how it has affected our relationship other than to say that it has totally killed the intimacy. He has had it all his life but kept it from me for almost 2 years until after we were married. He is refusing to get treatment however much it is affecting our marriage and how it must be affecting his health. I recently separated from him because I am tired of dealing with this issue that never goes away. Is there anyone else out there either dealing with the same issue or has the disorder themselves? It could help me decide what to do regarding my marriage. 
 ok i would say i particularly have an eating disorder, but i do restrict food, and go through fads. i eat very slowly and small amount. i go through phases where i may eat two meals a day for a few days then i will eat one meal, sometimes nothing, just drinking coffee and smoking to keep me going. then i can go for a couple of weeks eating two meals a day. i would say that the majority of meals i have are child portions because i can't stand the feeling of being full. i know i use food to control things and half appreciate the feeling i get when i don't eat. i can however sometimes enjoy food, strange as it sounds. sometimes i will just snack and have a chocolate bar to keep me going, yet my weight doesn't seem to fluctuate much. So am i making a deal out of nothing or not. i have started to take note of what i eat each day, and i only ever weigh myself when i am work.... i don't have scales in my house or i would probably weigh myself about five times a day. honesty is appreciated, i do want you to say if i am just over reacting a little. 
 on a scale or on a dress tag. I am a human being. I am a person with a soul and a heart inside filled with love and caring. I am worthwhile. I am full of life. I feel. I hurt. I cry. I laugh. I have rights. I deserve better than what I'm giving myself. I have hope. I have doubt. I want things. I need things. I'm alive. I'm thankful. I'm sad. I need to give myself credit when I try really hard. I want to be in recovery. I mess up (a lot). I need to forgive myself. I'm NOT crazy. I'm suffering. My heart aches. I am a human being. NOT a number. Never JUST a number. 
 Eating disorder risk high in young active women Tuesday, August 12, 2008 NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Young female athletes or those with high levels of physical activity seem to be more vulnerable to eating disorders than their less athletic peers, a study suggests. Researchers found that among 274 female undergraduates, those who were regularly active -- whether through sports or by exercising on their own -- were more likely to be dissatisfied with their bodies, strive to remain thin or have symptoms of bulimia. At greatest risk were students who competed in varsity athletics and had a high level of anxiety over their performance, the researchers report in the International Journal of Eating Disorders. Past studies have shown that female athletes tend to have a higher risk of eating disorders than their non-athletic counterparts, though the risk seems to vary according to the sport. Not surprisingly, sports that place a high value on thinness -- such as gymnastics, figure skating or distance running -- have been particularly linked to body-image concerns and unhealthy weight-control habits. Similarly, excessive levels of exercise can be a symptom of an eating disorder, or a signal that someone is at risk of developing one. These latest findings suggest that "sports anxiety" may contribute to eating disorder risk in athletes, according to the researchers, led by Dr. Jill M. Holm-Denoma of the University of Vermont in Burlington. Among athletes in their study, those who scored high on a standard measure of sports anxiety also had the highest rates of body dissatisfaction and bulimia symptoms. "As women's participation in athletics increases, so too does the need for awareness of the link between eating disorders and sports participation among women," Holm-Denoma said in a journal statement. "Coaches and athletic departments should consider consulting with clinicians to implement prevention and monitoring programs for the female athletes and independent exercisers at their universities," she added. It's not clear whether sports and physical activity actually cause young women to become dissatisfied with their bodies. "On one hand," the researchers write, "women may develop eating disorder symptoms as a result of participating in athletic events and experiencing the associated pressures of competition." "Alternatively," they add, "women who are at a high risk for developing eating disorders may elect to become involved in athletics, perhaps in an effort to manage their weight." Future studies should try to weed out the reasons that sports, sports anxiety and eating disorder symptoms are all linked, the researchers conclude.

 The Growing Phenomenon of Pregorexia August 14, 2008 The majority of us are well aware of the pressure to be perfectly slim and sculpted. Now the stress of looking svelte has reached pregnant women, some of whom have begun dieting and exercising excessively to be thin. To describe this latest phenomenon, the press has chosen pregorexia,  following in the footsteps of other trendy terms like drunkorexia and orthorexia  and the media and blogosphere have been abuzz about it all week. New Zealand and England in particular have seen an increase in expectant moms restricting their eating and upping their workouts to try to stay trim. Not surprisingly, like the pressure for the perfect six-pack and toned thighs, the pressure to be a fit, trendy mom trickles down from the media and Hollywood. Its tough not to pay attention to the images of slim and trim celebrities  with petite frames and tiny baby bumps just days before theyre due  or focus on the magazine covers revealing post-pregnancy weight-loss secrets. A prime example of these secret solutions comes to us from The New York Daily News. In a celebs arsenal, the article explains, youll find breastfeeding, the mommy makeover (made up of a tummy tuck, breast lift and liposuction and increasingly requested by moms) and lots of working out. Interestingly, even a C-section can promote weight-loss. According to one doctor: Your body is trying to repair itself and that stimulates your metabolism. Plus youre usually on a liquid diet for the first few days afterward. You can lose about 10 pounds. So if you keep that off, watch your diet and get back to exercising, you can look really good.This sends a dangerous, unhealthy message to expectant moms that a) a pregnant womans body isnt beautiful, unless its thin, of course; b) the most important thing to focus on after giving birth is weight-loss at all costs; and c) you must be perfect. Expectant moms have to maintain a perfect balance between not gaining too much weight  which comes with its own health risks  and gaining enough, writes the body image blog, 5 Resolutions to Transform the Fashion and Beauty Industries. And not putting on enough pounds can also have dire consequences. Fox News cites a recent study that found, Gaining too little weight during pregnancy is associated with poor fetal growth, lower birth weight and the chance of a babys being born prematurely. So, what can the average woman do? For starters, keep in mind that celebrity moms have an army of professionals clamoring to help them. Mom and author Suzanne Schlosberg told MSNBC: Theyve [celebs] got somebody to take care of baby while they do their workouts with their $250-an-hour trainer. Theyve got a fancy personal chef creating their perfect 200-calorie meals. Its not an even playing field. They have all these advantages that real people dont have.Also, check out inspiring Web sites like Theshapeofamother.com, which includes photos of real moms, who arent airbrushed, havent had plastic surgery and are proud of their bodies. Finally, dont hesitate to talk to your doctor or seek a therapist. Be honest with yourself about what youre feeling and the struggles youre going through. Reach out to friends and family  youll find that many moms relate to your experiences. 
 Teen's eating disorders fueled by anxiety Thursday, June 12, 2008 NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Eating disorder symptoms are only temporary for many adolescents, according to the results of a self-reported survey conducted in Finland. However, among teens with persistent or recurring symptoms, anxiety appears to be an underlying factor. Teens who don't get better on their own usually have many other mental and physical problems, the study demonstrates. "However, our findings should not be interpreted as meaning that 'wait and see' would be an adequate approach with adolescents who report eating disorder symptoms but no other problems," Lea Hautala, a PhD student at the University of Turko, and her colleagues warn in their report in the Journal of Advanced Nursing. In Western cultures, Hautala and her colleagues note, disordered eating is relatively common among adolescents. Eating disorder symptoms will last for 1 to 2 years in 50 percent to 60 percent of teens, while just 1 in 10 adolescents with eating disorder symptoms will develop an eating disorder that persists into adulthood. The researchers followed 372 boys and girls 15 to 17 years old for 1 year to determine whether certain factors could help identify individuals who would have more long-lasting eating problems. A survey was administered at study entry and again 1 year later. At the initial assessment, 13 percent of the study participants reported having some eating disorder symptoms on the first or second survey, while 5 percent reported symptoms on both surveys. While five times as many girls as boys had persistent eating disorder symptoms, the proportion of boys who had the symptoms at just one point in time was larger, with just twice as many girls as boys. The students who reported eating disorder symptoms at both time points were more likely than their peers to also have several other psychological and health problems. But anxiety was the only factor that independently predicted the risk of persistent eating disorder symptoms; individuals with eating disorder symptoms who were identified as anxious at the study's outset were 20 times more likely to still have those symptoms a year later. "Our findings suggest that disordered eating does not occur separately, but as part of a more extensive ill-being," Hautala and her team say. "Therefore, adolescents who have psychological problems or multiple health complaints should be screened for eating disorder symptoms." All adolescents who report eating disorder symptoms, the researchers add, should be followed up whether or not they have other mental or physical health problems.

 Do more, talk less to help heavy teens: Parents who push kids to diet should instead urge them to get moving Wed., June 4, 2008 Parents of overweight teens who recognize that their kids are too fat don't take steps to help them to eat more healthily or to be more active, but they do push them to diet  and this pressure is likely to backfire, a new study shows. Parents who are concerned about their child's weight should do more and talk less, Dr. Dianne Neumark-Sztainer of the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, told Reuters Health. "Serve more fruits and vegetables, have more family meals, find ways to be more physically active, turn off the TV," said Neumark-Sztainer, the author of I'm Like So Fat: Helping Your Teen Make Healthy Choices About Eating and Exercise in a Weight-Obsessed World. "Possibly more important is to talk less about weight and dieting," she added. "Teens are very sensitive about these topics, and are very likely to take a parents' well-intentioned comments as criticism. Parents are for the most part trying to help their children, it's just a sensitive issue." Concerns have been raised that parents often don't realize when a child is overweight, Neumark-Sztainer and colleagues note in the June issue of the medical journal Pediatrics. They analyzed information obtained from 170 parent-child pairs in which the child was overweight. For girls, 54 percent of parents classified them correctly as overweight, while the rest thought their daughter's weight was "about right." Among boys, 40 percent of parents said their sons were overweight. Parents who saw their children as overweight were no more likely than those who didn't to eat meals as a family or make fruit and vegetables available at home and serve them at dinner. They were also no less likely to eat fast food at family meals; watch TV during meals; stock the pantry with soft drinks, candy and salty snacks; or encourage their children to be more active or to eat a healthier diet. Fifty-seven percent of these parents said they encouraged their children to diet to control their weight, compared to about 33 percent of parents who didn't think their children were too fat. But for both boys and girls, being encouraged to diet roughly tripled their likelihood of still being overweight five years later. Past research has shown that teens who diet may actually be more likely to gain weight over time, Neumark-Sztainer noted; kids who diet tend to binge-eat more often, skip breakfast, and use other less healthy, and less effective, weight control strategies, she explained. "We want to place less emphasis on informing parents about their child's weight status and more emphasis on providing parents with the skills and the support that they need to make their home environments healthier and more conducive to healthier weight management," Neumark-Sztainer said. 
 Risk Factors for Eating Disorders Vary by Gender Rejecting media images, resilience to negative comments should be focus of prevention TUESDAY, June 3 (HealthDay News) -- Boys and girls develop eating disorders for different reasons, so prevention strategies may need to vary by gender, according to a new report. "Frequent dieting and trying to look like persons in the media were independent predictors of binge eating in females of all ages. In males, negative comments about weight by fathers was predictive of starting to binge at least weekly," wrote the authors, whose findings were published in the June issue of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. Prevention strategies, they said, should address those specific causes. For example, campaigns aimed at females should focus on media literacy and decreasing their susceptibility to media images; for males, efforts should focus on how to be more resilient to negative comments about weight. In analyzing seven years of data on more than 12,500 children, the researchers found 10.3 percent of the girls and 3 percent of the boys started to binge eat or purge (vomit or use laxatives to control weight) at least once a week. Purging (5.3 percent) was slightly more common than binge eating (4.3 percent) in girls, while boys were almost three times as likely to binge eat than purge (2.1 percent versus 0.8 percent). Only a small proportion of boys and girls had both disorders. The children were between age 9 and 15 at the start of the study in 1996. While girls under age 14 whose mothers had a history eating disorders were almost three times as likely than other children to start purging at least once a week, "maternal history of an eating disorder was unrelated to risk of starting to binge eat or purge in older adolescent females," wrote the authors, who were led by Alison E. Field, of the Children's Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School. 
 DVDs help caregivers of eating disorder patients Monday, May 12, 2008 NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Caregivers of eating disorder patients who used a skills training DVD along with telephone coaching to help them cope with their loved one's illness were highly satisfied with the program, saying it helped reduce their stress levels, UK researchers report. With just 14 participants, the study was too small to show a significant effect of the training program on caregivers' psychological distress or depression, but there was a trend toward users having less distress after completing the program, Dr. Ana R. Sepulveda of Guy's Hospital, London and colleagues found. "The high acceptance rate of this pilot study also shows that the carers of people with eating disorders seem highly motivated to receive support and take an active part in helping their relatives to recover," the researchers say. People caring for a person with an eating disorder must provide substantial emotional support to the ill person, and may themselves suffer considerable distress, Sepulveda and her team explain. At the same time misunderstanding of the family and individual's role in the illness "can lead to patterns of overprotection, criticism or hostility," they note in the May issue of the International Journal of Eating Disorders. "These problematic patterns of communication and reactions to the illness can hinder rather than help change," the researchers write. Sepulveda and her colleagues developed a 3-day workshop to offer support to families of people with eating disorders and give them the skills they need to help the patient recover. In the current study, they tested a five-DVD program that included the workshop's educational content and skills training via Power Point presentations and video clips. Caregivers also were offered telephone coaching support to help them cope with crises. When study participants' ratings of the five DVDs were averaged, 85.6% said they helped their stress levels, while 90.8% said they offered "at least enough" in terms of practical skills. Participants also said they found the telephone coaching to be helpful. The findings, while preliminary, suggest that this "new form of intervention" could be relevant and useful, the researchers say. However, they add, some in-person contact may still be needed for the program to be truly effective. SOURCE: International Journal of Eating Disorders, May 2008. 
 The disorder next door: Alarming eating habits by Tula Karras, SELF April 25, 2008 SELF poll reveals 65 percent of American women are disordered eaters SELFs groundbreaking survey reveals that more than six in 10 women are disordered eaters. Another one in 10 has an eating disorder. Find out if youre at risk and how to get healthier, starting today. Michelle Marsh, 32, of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, seems like the perfect dieter. If you ran into the 5-foot-1-inch, 103-pound marketing specialist checking food labels for calories in the supermarket or powering through one of her seven weekly workouts, youd envy her ability to control her intake and burn off any excess, too. But Marsh, who had her first baby nine months ago and is now below her prepregnancy weight (Im the tiniest Ive ever been! she says), could be the poster girl for an unrecognized epidemic among women: disordered eating. No, she doesnt starve herself to an unnatural weight (like anorexics) or throw up daily (like some bulimics), but she doesnt seem to have a healthy relationship with food or her body, either. I spend about half my time thinking about food and meal planning, she says, although her meals dont require much planning  she usually restricts herself to the same foods every day (oatmeal, brown rice and two small corn tortillas with chicken and a sweet potato). I weigh myself every morning, and if the scale goes up a pound, I exercise more. If I gained 5 pounds, Id be very upset. Sound familiar? It should: Sixty-five percent of American women who responded to a national survey by SELF are disordered eaters. Eating habits that women think are normal  such as banishing carbs, skipping meals and, in some cases, even dieting itself  may actually be symptoms of the syndrome. Although disordered eating doesnt have the lethal potential of anorexia or bulimia, it can wreck your emotional and physical health, says Cynthia Bulik, Ph.D., director of the eating disorders program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and SELF's partner in the survey. And its everywhere, afflicting women like your sister, your friend, your co-worker  or you. The online SELF survey garnered responses from 4,000 women ages 25 to 45 to a detailed questionnaire about their eating habits and found that most disordered eaters fall into one or more of six categories. "Calorie prisoners" are terrified of gaining weight, tend to see food as good or bad and feel extremely guilty if they indulge in something thats off-limits. Secret eaters binge on junk food at home, in the car  wherever they wont be found out. Career dieters may not know what to eat without a plan to follow; despite their efforts, theyre more likely than other types to be overweight or obese. Purgers are obsessed with ridding their body of unwanted calories and bloat by using laxatives, diuretics or occasional vomiting. Food addicts eat to soothe stress, deal with anger, even celebrate a happy event; they think about food nearly all the time. Extreme exercisers work out despite illness, injury or exhaustion and solely for weight loss; they are devastated if they miss a session. Like Marsh, who Bulik describes as a calorie prisoner and an exercise addict, many disordered eaters piece together a painful mix of destructive habits. Others may shift between categories over the years, ricocheting from restricting to bingeing to purging, for instance. Even more frightening, the SELF survey reveals that an additional 10 percent of women suffer from outright eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, meaning that a total of 75 percent of all American women  three out of four  eat, think and behave abnormally around food. And despite the stereotype that eating issues affect mostly young women, SELF found that those in their 30s and 40s suffer from disordered eating at virtually the same rates. No wonder, given that we live in a culture that spawns best sellers with titles such as "Skinny Bitch" and fetishizes stick-thin, ageless celebs on tabloid shows and Web sites even as our obesity rate continues to rise. Dieting is a national pastime for women, says Margo Maine, Ph.D., an eating disorders specialist in West Hartford, Connecticut. As a society, we dont see the problem. Indeed, 67 percent of women surveyed (excluding those with diagnosed eating disorders) are trying to lose weight, mirroring the number who are overweight or obese. A few eat nutritiously and exercise moderately. The rest turn to risky tricks: Thirty-five percent use diet pills, 26 percent cut out entire food groups and 13 percent even smoke to slim down, they confessed to SELF. The result is failure; extreme measures dont work. Just ask career dieter Kathie, 42, a mother of two in Fairfax Station, Virginia, who asked that we not print her last name. Raised in a clean-your-plate house where sweets were locked away in a metal cabinet in the basement, Kathie went on her first diet at age 10. A neighbor and I tried to see how long we could go without eating, she says. We lasted three days. Because her access to treats was restricted, Kathie didnt know how to handle them when she got to college. The freshman 15 was more like the freshman 80, she says. I inhaled everything. Two decades of dieting followed. I did the grapefruit diet, the cabbage soup diet, Atkins, everything, Kathie says. My mother joked that I had my fat closet and my skinny closet, and I could never get rid of my fat clothes. I felt doomed to be fat. 
 Childhood trauma may spur unhealthy eating later Thursday, April 17, 2008 NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - College students who went through traumatic experiences as children may be at greater risk of developing an eating disorder, a new study suggests. Two hundred nine freshmen students completed questionnaires on trauma history at the beginning and at the end of a semester. The students were also asked if they had ever suffered various broad categories of trauma -- such as violent trauma, sexual trauma or the death of a loved one -- and had them rate how severely they had been affected the event. The subjects were between 18 and 19 years old, 55 percent were female and most - 96.3 percent - were Caucasian. Over the course of the study, 30 students dropped out. The researchers found that students with a history of trauma -- ranging from the divorce of their parents, to the death of a loved one, to physical or sexual abuse -- were more likely to have symptoms of an eating disorder. Students who, for example, said they'd suffered a "violent trauma" in the past were more likely than their peers to skip meals, fast, binge-eat or abuse diet pills or laxatives. Bingeing, laxative abuse and vomiting were also more common among students who said they'd been traumatized by divorce or the death of someone they loved. Previous studies have found that victims of childhood sexual abuse are at increased risk of bulimia and, to a lesser extent, anorexia. The current findings suggest that a range of childhood traumas may contribute to eating disorder risk, according to the researchers, led by Dr. Joshua M. Smyth, an associate professor of psychology at Syracuse University in New York. They report the results in the International Journal of Eating Disorders. Overall, Smyth's team found, students with a history of childhood trauma were both more likely to already have eating-related problems and more likely to develop new problems over the course of the semester. The findings have implications for screening and prevention of eating disorders in college, according to the researchers. It's estimated that 2 percent to 4 percent of college students have an eating disorder, they note, and many more have symptoms that fall short of an eating disorder diagnosis, but are nonetheless serious. The "most direct" way to reach at-risk college students, Smyth and his colleagues suggest, would be to screen incoming freshman for past traumas, then provide them with information on how to get help. However, if that is too intrusive, they add, colleges could instead offer an information session to all incoming students on how to get counseling or other supportive services.

 Eating disorders may be contagious: study Fri Apr 18, 2008 NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A study of U.S. high school students provides additional evidence that eating disorders may be contagious. In a study, researchers found that binging, fasting, diet pill use and other eating disorder symptoms clustered within counties, particularly among female students. "These findings confirm the strong social influences on female adolescents in the U.S. to be thin, sometimes using unhealthy behaviors to achieve this goal," the researchers write in the current issue of the International Journal of Eating Disorders. Research in the 1980s in female college students first suggested that disordered eating behavior spread through "social contagion," demonstrating that binge eating clustered within sororities, Dr. Valerie L. Forman-Hoffman and Cassie L. Cunningham of the VA Iowa City Health Care System note in their report. In the current study, they looked at whether a similar pattern would be seen among high school students at the county-wide level by analyzing nationally representative data on 15,349 high school students. There was indeed a small but significant clustering effect, the researchers found. A pair of students from the same county was 4 percent to 10 percent more likely to share an eating-disordered behavior when compared to pairs in which each person came from a different county. Severe food intake restriction, dieting, exercising and diet pill use all showed clustering by county, as did any weight control symptom overall or any eating disorder symptom. But no clustering was seen for purging, possibly due to the "secretive," less socially acceptable nature of this behavior, the researchers suggest. Clustering patterns were the same in rural, suburban and urban counties. While the study wasn't designed to look at why these behaviors might be clustering in certain counties, the researchers suggest that peer pressure, information sharing or students modeling their behavior on one another are possible mechanisms. Based on their results, the researchers think it may be more effective to target eating disorder prevention efforts to counties or schools where they are more common, rather than individual students.

 I'm really struggling with my goal weight and calorie level right now. I am still about 25 pounds less than my previous "goal weight" where my binge drive and hunger disappeared last time in treatment, but my BMI is healthy [[Edit: potential triggering number]] just where I am. And I'm on a higher calorie level than I've ever been. My dietician wants to up my calories even more because I'm not gaining. I try to argue that my metabolism is simply working better than it was six months ago, but arguing about your goal weight is just viewed as an "eating disorder" behavior. But in all honesty that's not where its coming from. My body feels good where it is right now and I don't think they should force me to a higher weight just "because". If they force me, it'll only be more tempting to return to the behaviors I've left behind. I managed to get out of a calorie increase for today, at least the doctor is kind of on my side, but my dietician will be relentless in staying on top of this (I wouldn't expect any less-she's good at her job). I just wish they could believe that I'm not being eating-disorder motivated in this. 
 Does anybody know anything about the eating disorders program at Homewood in Guelph, ON? I'm probably going and was just wondering if anyone had any insight on the program there or personal experience? 
 Psychopharmacotherapy in Eating Disorders: A Systematic Analysis by Andrea Riedl; Janine Becker; M. Rauchfuss; Burghard F. Klappa Psychopharmacol Bull. 2008;41(1):1-22. 03/24/2008 The most common and serious eating disorders, which are particularly prevalent in young women, are anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge-eating disorders (BED). Further, the prevalence of unspecific hyperphagous eating disorders frequently causing obesity is substantially increasing. All of these eating disorders tend to be chronic and comorbid to psychiatric diagnoses. Due to the multifactorial aetiology these disorders require a multimodal treatment. Among different treatment options, symptomatic psychopharmacotherapy has been an important component and especially in recent decades, it has been subject to many trials. This article gives an overview of the current literature, summarizing diagnostic criteria, epidemiology, and critically discussing psychopharmacotherapy of those eating disorders. Based on the literature and our clinical experience the psychopharmacological recommendations for patients with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder are suggested.

 Study shows midlife eating disorders on the rise By Jeanann Pannasch, Today Mon., March. 17, 2008 The condition can affect people of any age, but the treatment holds steady When we think about those at risk for anorexia or bulimia, we think of impressionable adolescent girls, desperate for their bodies to resemble the beautiful, thin women on television and in magazines. But in recent years, psychologists across the country have noticed a rise in eating disorders among women in their 30s, 40s and 50s. And a new study from The Eating Disorder Center of Denver confirms that an increasing number of women in midlife (30-65), are indeed struggling with these dangerous and potentially deadly disorders. Women with eating disorders who are age 30 and above fly under the radar in terms of getting noticed and treated, says Dr. Tamara Pryor, Clinical Director of the Denver center and the author of the study. Over the past four years or so, we've been seeing more midlife women with eating disorders in our center. Dr. Pryor refers to this phenomenon as the Desperate Housewives effect because of how slim and young the middle-aged women on the popular television show appear. She adds that this name puts some responsibility on a culture that supports and encourages "fountain of youth fixes." These modern-day fixes, like Botox injections and skyrocketing cosmetic surgery rates, mean that older women are under more pressure than ever to appear young and slender  even if it's not normal for women over 30 to have the same bodies they did at 18. In examining the midlife eating disorder patients, Dr. Pryor identified that most, 94 percent, suffered from these disorders in their youth, and something triggered either a relapse or their condition to worsen at an older age. Some of the midlife stressors that can trigger these disorders include divorce, aging parents, children leaving home, menopause and their own aging bodies. Gail Schoenbach, 47, is the founder of the F.R.E.E.D. foundation, a non-profit organization that funds eating disorder treatments for those in need. After struggling with bulimia for 24 years, Schoenbach sought help after her husband intervened. She says the affliction started in college as a diet and a way to stay thin, and she initially thought it would go away. Despite having three children, Schoenbach continued to purge between one and 30 times a day, even though her young children were around. When Schoenbach sought inpatient treatment at the age of 41, she was the oldest woman in her group. But despite the age difference, Schoenbach noted that in treatment, she found that she had a lot in common with a 16-year-old, and realized that the treatment for the disorder was similar for people of all ages. Dr. Pryor explains that although a midlife eating disorder patient may be 46 years old, she is actually 16 years old, developmentally, since this kind of affliction can stunt emotional development. Patients often lack confidence and do not feel in control of their lives. And the external influences that make women feel badly about themselves are equally at work on both groups. In fact, Dr. Pryor says, it seems that younger and older females alike feel that they are in the same toxic environment. Not surprisingly, the study found the midlife patients and younger women shared the same psychological issues: low self-esteem or self-worth, body loathing and, perhaps, a co-existing psychiatric condition. The study also identified a profile or temperament associated with those at risk for eating disorders: worrisome individuals with low self-esteem and a high level of anxiety. Other factors may include possible abuse (emotional, physical or sexual) and grief or loss. Since the younger and older patients are grappling with the same issues of worth and image, Dr. Pryor says that there is no need to have separate treatment settings. Dr. Pryors study brings awareness to a new group of women, mother or even grandmothers in danger. Hopefully, once loved ones are aware of the temperament of someone at risk for an eating disorder, they can take steps to prevent it or intervene before its too late. Left untreated, severe eating disorders can lead to heart failure or suicide. Dr. Pryor warns that the data indicates that eating disorders can be chronic, relapsing illnesses  but that those who seek early treatment (regardless of age) are best off. Recognizing the disorder is an important step, and to that end its positive that there is media awareness of the condition. Even many celebrities have admitted to their own struggles with eating disorders in their youth  Jane Fonda, Princess Diana, Oprah Winfrey are among them. However, only a few, including Sharon Osbourne and Wynonna Judd, have admitted to a continued struggle in their later years, echoing Dr. Pryors warning that the condition can be a chronic one. Gale Schoenbach can certainly agree to that: As she approaches 50, she says she feels stronger, but that every day is still a test. 
 Starving Themselves, Cocktail in Hand By SARAH KERSHAW, New York Times March 2, 2008 Manorexia. Orthorexia. Diabulimia. Binge Eating Disorder. All are dangerous variations on the eating disorders anorexia and bulimia, and have become buzzwords that are popping up on Web sites and blogs, on television and in newspaper articles. As celebrity magazines chronicle the glamorous and the suffering, therapists and a growing number of researchers are trying to treat and understand the conditions. The latest entry in the lexicon of food-related ills is drunkorexia, shorthand for a disturbing blend of behaviors: self-imposed starvation or bingeing and purging, combined with alcohol abuse. Drunkorexia is not an official medical term. But it hints at a troubling phenomenon in addiction and eating disorders. Among those who are described as drunkorexics are college-age binge drinkers, typically women, who starve all day to offset the calories in the alcohol they consume. The term is also associated with serious eating disorders, particularly bulimia, which often involve behavior like bingeing on food  and alcohol  and then purging. Anorexics, because they severely restrict their calorie intake, tend to avoid alcohol. But some drink to calm down before eating or to ease the anxiety of having indulged in a meal. Others consume alcohol as their only sustenance. Still others use drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine to suppress their appetites. There are women who are afraid to put a grape in their mouth but have no problem drinking a beer, said Douglas Bunnell, the director of outpatient clinical services for the Renfrew Center, based in Philadelphia. The center, like a small but growing number of eating-disorder and addiction-treatment facilities, most on the West Coast, offers a dual focus on substance abuse and eating disorders. Dr. Bunnell, the past president of the National Eating Disorders Association, said the obsession with being skinny and the social acceptance of drinking and using drugs  along with the sense, lately, that among celebrities, checking into rehab is almost a given, if not downright chic  are partly to blame. Both disorders are behaviors that are glorified and reinforced, Dr. Bunnell said. Binge drinking is almost cool and hip, and losing weight and being thin is a cultural imperative for young women in America. Mixing both is not surprising, and it has reached a tipping point in terms of public awareness. Psychologists say that eating disorders, like other addictions, are often rooted in the need to numb emotional pain with substances or the rush provided by bingeing and purging. The disorders are often driven by childhood trauma like sexual abuse, neglect and other sources of mental anguish. Manorexia is the male version of anorexia. Orthorexia is an obsession with what is perceived as healthy food  eliminating fats and preservatives, for example. But people with this condition can dangerously deprive themselves of needed nutrients. Diabulimia refers to diabetics who avoid taking insulin, which can cause weight gain, in order to control their weight. Despite the name, the disorder does not typically involve purging. Binge Eating Disorder refers to obsessive overeating, especially of foods high in salt and sugar, that does not involve excessive exercise or purging to compensate for the high caloric intake. Judy Van De Veen, 36, who lives in Gillette, N.J., became anorexic at 24. She said she starved herself, meting out small bites of low-calorie food for two months. Then she began bingeing and purging, throwing up entire boxes of cereal, whole pizzas and fast food from drive-throughs that sometimes cost her $80 a day. She went into treatment, both inpatient and outpatient, for her eating disorder for several years in the late 1990s, with mixed results. In 2001, still struggling with bulimia, she took up drinking. If she ate while drinking, she said, she would purge, but then consume more alcohol to make up for the loss, because she wanted to remain drunk. Many bulimics who drink use alcohol to vomit, experts on eating disorders say, because liquid is easier to purge. They also tend to vomit because they often drink on empty stomachs. In the beginning of my eating disorder I wouldnt touch alcohol because it is so high in calories, said Ms. Van De Veen, who later found herself regularly hospitalized for dehydration. But I have the disease of more: I just want more no matter what it is. Two years into her drinking problem, she joined a 12-step program. She spent the next two years in and out of six residential rehab programs, spending about $25,000 of her own money because she didnt have health insurance. But none of the programs were equipped to address eating disorders, so she binged and purged and her eating disorder raged. Ms. Van De Veen said she has been sober for three years, but is still struggling with bulimia. She now has a 14-month-old daughter, Cheyenne, and she said that her pregnancy and support groups had helped her make progress on her eating disorder. I had an excuse to eat, she said of being pregnant. I didnt care and I loved it. But she said the temptation to binge and purge is haunting her again. Trish, 27, who has had an eating disorder for the last 10 years, recently checked into Renfrew, her fifth stint in a treatment center or hospital. Like Ms. Van De Veen, Trish, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition that only her first name be used to protect her privacy, struggled with anorexia first and then found alcohol. Before she was admitted to Renfrew, she said she was blacking out from lack of food and suffering from excruciating stomach pain. Trish, a nurse who lives in Ohio and works with cardiac patients, said she would starve herself through her 8- or 12-hour shifts, staring at the clock and fixating on when she could have her first drink. Drinking, she said, relaxed her when she had to eat in front of other people, a huge source of stress. The alcohol is probably what kept any weight on me, she said in an interview late last month at the Renfrew Center, which she entered on New Years Eve for eight weeks of treatment. Drinking helped me be less anxious, she said. It helped me be more of Trish. The two go together: If I drink more, Im more into my eating disorder and vice versa. Studies show that binge drinking and alcohol abuse are on the rise among women, who are also more prone than men to eating disorders. About 25 to 33 percent of bulimics also struggle with alcohol or drugs, according to a study published last year in the journal Biological Psychiatry. Between 20 and 25 percent of anorexics have substance abuse problems, the study found. A growing number of researchers are examining the psychological and neurological links between eating disorders and substance abuse: Does eating a chocolate bar, or bingeing and purging, stimulate the same pleasure centers in the brain as drugs or alcohol? Suzette M. Evans, a professor of clinical neuroscience at Columbia, recently began a study of the connection between bulimia and substance abuse, a field she said has been neglected. People are finally beginning to realize that food can function in the same way as drugs and alcohol, Dr. Evans said. As more patients seek treatment for both eating disorders and substance abuse, a complicated set of mixed messages can arise. The response to addiction is abstinence; but quitting food is not an option. Were trying to get our patients to find effective behaviors and life skills, said Dr. Kevin Wandler, the vice president for medical services at Remuda Ranch, which addresses both eating disorders and addiction at its facilities in Arizona and Virginia. Eating normally would be an effective behavior, but its easier to give up alcohol and drugs because you never need it again, Dr. Wandler said. If your drug is food, thats a challenge. Trish left Renfrew on Feb. 22, after her second time in treatment there. She was determined, she said, to break her obsessions with weight, food and alcohol. Before she checked in, I didnt even have the energy to laugh, she said. But as she prepared to go home, she had more hope than she has had in years. I will not live my life like this, she said. Ive learned this time not to be ashamed. I want to love myself and I want to forgive myself. 
 Eating Disorders Challenge All With thousands in Wales affected by an eating disorder, Assembly Members are examining how to improve treatment and awareness. Plaid Cymru AM Bethan Jenkins explains why she believes decisive action is needed. We live an age where the pressures of a reality TV and celebrity role-model society bear heavy on us all, not least on those who are most susceptible to such pressures, namely young people. It appears that social perceptions of such illnesses remain a taboo subject for many. But I am in no doubt that the magnitude of the issue is such that our assembly and government must act decisively. To put eating disorders into context, it is estimated that there are around 56,000 sufferers in Wales and, according to the National Institute for Eating Disorders, one in five die as a result of their illness. According to the mental health charity Mind, as many as one woman in twenty will have eating patterns that are cause for concern, most will be aged between 14 to 25. There is no dedicated residential treatment centre in Wales specifically for sufferers of eating disorders. Whilst I recognise that community provision does exist, those who reach a more critical stage of illness have no option but to seek private care in England. There is no national strategy in Wales on eating disorders at the moment, and in order to rectify this I deemed it appropriate to establish a cross-party committee on eating disorders at the National Assembly for Wales. The committee agreed that a national strategy was needed and, further, will launch a declaration of objectives during (this week's) Eating Disorders Awareness Week. The aims and objectives include a commitment to compiling a comprehensive analysis of eating disorders in Wales, including current provision and support so that we are fully aware of the specific challenges we face. The cross-party group is also committed to raising awareness of eating disorders and calls for proactive campaigns in schools and universities and throughout society. We also recognise the need for increased training in the health sector to equip frontline staff with the skills to identify and deal with patients effectively. One of the aims for us in Wales must be to establish a specialist residential unit here, so that sufferers are not forced to seek residential care outside Wales and in the private sector. I am clear that any national strategy will need to tackle this problem on many fronts, not least in reversing current mis-conceptions. Only 1% of young people recently surveyed by charity b-eat felt they could talk to their parents about eating disorders. The challenge we face affects us all. As we take the first tentative steps in addressing this issue in Wales, I am hopeful that we can conclude with a just outcome for those who need our care and support. 
 Offhand Comments Can Serve As Triggers Feb 3.2008 by Anne-Marie Tobin, THE CANADIAN PRESS TORONTO - Shayla Gutterman received treatment for an eating disorder a few years ago, and sounds confident and wise beyond her 19 years when she offers advice to parents and other teens who might be at risk. "One hundred per cent, I would say get rid of the scale," said Gutterman, now a second-year student at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ont. "You can't really tell whether you're fat or skinny from a scale. It's about how you feel and it's about your body structure. And you can be muscular and fit, and weigh more than someone who's not. So I think the scale throws people off hugely." Gutterman said her earliest memories of being concerned about her weight go back to when she was in Grade 1. When she was about 13, she began restricting her food intake while she was at a "sleep away" summer camp for about a month. "And that was for me a good opportunity to, I guess, lose some weight. So I started at camp, and it got to the point where I was fainting." Her eating habits reverted to normal when she returned home, although she would go through phases - a week here and there - when she would again limit her eating. In Grade 11, though, as her family prepared for a winter trip to Mexico, she said it served as a trigger to make her really want to lose weight. "So I started then, and it was at that point that laxatives and diet pills, and exercise and purging entered the equation. It definitely got worse," she said. Her mother, who knew about the dieting but didn't realize what else was going on, said Shayla eventually sought help - which often isn't the case with someone suffering from anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. "She actually came to me and said to me, 'I am really unhappy,"' said Anita Gutterman, who lives in Thornhill, Ont. "She was hiding it and it wasn't overt, and it usually isn't. And she said, 'I'm not just losing weight, I'm really not eating, and it's escalated into a problem, and I need you to help me."' "And I am so fortunate that she did that because many girls - they don't want to get better, they don't want the help. They don't admit it." After seeking help from a family doctor and other health care professionals, Shayla said she was "very lucky" to get into a day treatment program at Southlake Regional Health Centre in Newmarket, Ont. "There you are really forced to have three meals and two snacks a day, and that was intervention for me," she said, adding that she had to stop taking laxatives and diet pills, and limit exercise. Dr. Ahmed Boachie, director of the eating disorder program at Southlake, said society is so slim-obsessed that some young people wrongly believe they're overweight, and worry about becoming obese. "And what has happened, some of them can actually be so preoccupied with food and food-related issues, and in their fight to avoid being obese some of them are actually starting off as normal weight, and some of them are actually underweight," he said. "In trying to avoid being obese, they stop eating and they can develop eating disorders - anorexia or bulimia, which are two of the most devastating chronic illnesses." Up to 20 per cent of people with these illnesses will die if they don't receive proper treatment, he said. There isn't one particular thing that causes an eating disorder, said Boachie, a child psychiatrist who has been at the centre for six years. Sometimes a casual comment by a friend, such as "It looks like you've gained weight," will act as a trigger. "If you say that to the majority of young people, they may probably be able to brush this off," Boachie said. "But there are always a lot of people who have vulnerabilities. And this statement, which may seem innocent, may send them spiralling." Those who inherit perfectionistic tendencies are at greater risk, he noted. And only one boy for every 10 girls develops an eating disorder. Parents who diet frequently could be a factor, he said, along with not having good friends or having bad days at school. Kate Lum, volunteer co-ordinator at Sheena's Place, a support centre in downtown Toronto, said they're hearing about more younger and older females with the condition "due to the cultural insanity around expectations about how women should look." It's very difficult for a teenager to resist the onslaught of perfect-looking and "unhelpful" images shown on television and elsewhere, she said. Shayla Gutterman said magazine photos can affect her. "Even still, I try to stay away from magazines because I know, looking at them, it's not going to make me feel good," she said. And when she hears anyone make a comment about someone else's weight: "I hate it. I can't stand it." In terms of treatment, Lum, a survivor of anorexia, said the person really does need to want to get better, and when friends say something like "Why don't you just eat? You're too thin," it doesn't help. Lum said those sorts of comments made her think "You're just jealous" or "You're not my friend. You're trying to sabotage this." The incidence of eating disorders in North American teens is between 0.5 and one per cent, said Boachie. At Southlake, teens aged 13 to 18 who are in the day program are reintroduced to food with the encouragement of dietitians and a team of trained professionals. "We are not only looking for them to finish their meals, it's how they eat, the behaviours around food, what food represents," Boachie explained. "They attempt to cut it into pieces. Sometimes you can watch somebody eating, and they can tell you how difficult the eating disorder is by watching their behaviour." "Food is their medication," he said. "We make sure they finish everything on their plate. Every meal is measured so that they can finish it." Talking helps, too. Besides nutritional intake, the family-focused program includes an ongoing medical assessment, and discussions about body image, self-esteem and anxiety issues. "Up to about 70 per cent of them will get really well," Boachie said. "And then the other 30 per cent, a few of them will come back again and revisit the program." There are waiting lists for many programs across Canada, according to Lum, but Sheena's Place will put people into a support group right away so they can "stabilize a little" until treatment is available. Some people make use of private clinics in Canada and the U.S. because they can't wait for a spot at a place like Southlake, she said. Shayla Gutterman recommended that parents focus on balanced diet and health, rather than make comments like "Don't eat this, it's bad for you" or "This is fattening." "Do what makes you feel good." "I think it's always going to be a struggle," she said of her own battle with an eating disorder. "I'm OK now, though. I do what I can to stay happy." 
 Fat phobia feeds kids' eating disorders Sharon Kirkey, Canwest News Service Published: Saturday, January 19, 2008 Fears about obesity are feeding so much "fat phobia" that experts worry of an increase in healthy kids obsessing about weight and more parents projecting irrational fears about fat on their children. Some are questioning whether the obesity "epidemic" is even real and whether schools have any business trying to fight obesity. "It seems like whenever we decide there is an epidemic people run around helter-skelter trying to solve the problem without really thinking about it in an organized fashion," says Dr. Leora Pinhas, a child psychiatrist and psychiatric director of the eating disorders program at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children. "I'm not convinced that telling kids that they're fat, or that they might get fat, is a way of solving the problem." The hospital has seen pre-teens and teens who attended school-based obesity prevention programs, "who then decide they're going to be the best kid at not getting fat, who then end up losing so much weight that they put themselves medically at risk," Pinhas says. "They're little kids. They don't have to lose a lot of weight to get sick." "We have had kids who have been weighed in the gym and then had to deal with how they felt about their weight, and these may have been kids who never weighed themselves before and it hadn't been a concern before," Pinhas says. Children are being taught in nutrition classes how to cut all fat from their diet. But, "who buys food, who makes the meals? It's not the eight-year-old," Pinhas says. "All we seem to do is keep placing more unreasonable expectations on children that can be confusing for them." Children are hearing that fat is bad. Period. And where anorexia and bulimia before adolescence was once unheard of, hospitals are now seeing eating disorders in children as young as seven. Children are social sponges, Pinhas says. " How many times does a kid have to overhear a conversation like, 'wow you look great, you lost weight,' or 'look at my butt, it's really fat,' 'I should cut down on what I'm eating,' or 'all that fat is going to give you a heart attack'." Susan Willard says a lot of the pressure to be thin is now coming from home. "It's not infrequent that we see patients who have families who are over-invested in body shape and weight," says Willard, clinical director of the eating disorders treatment centre at River Oaks Hospital in New Orleans, where many patients come from Canada. Families where one or both parents "are very involved with their own bodies and with what they're putting into their bodies" so that calorie counting, fat gram counting and exercise "become a primary focus in the home and at the table." "Kids who grow up in families of that sort believe that it is of very primary importance that they eat 'right' and stay fit and healthy and that ultimately can turn out to be extremely unhealthy," says Willard, a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Tulane University School of Medicine and co-author of the book, When Dieting Becomes Dangerous. But parents also live in a culture that says what matters most is to be thin. "They're being told over and over again that if their kid is fat, it's like a death sentence. They're being told they're not good parents," Pinhas says. "I think we should stop worrying about whether someone is fat or not because it's not necessarily an indicator of poor lifestyle or imminent mortality or morbidity." Dr. Ahmed Boachie says many healthy weight teens believe, wrongly, that they're overweight. Even campaigns to rid schools of snacks can lead to negative messages and neurosis about food. "And when they feel that way they're more likely to be dieting," says Boachie, clinical director of the eating disorders program at Southlake Regional Health Centre in Newmarket, Ont. But a study of nearly 15,000 girls and boys aged nine to 14 showed that dieting not only doesn't work, it actually leads to weight gain. Kids severely restrict their diet, then lose control and binge or overeat, and the cycle continues. What's more, dieting is considered a risk factor for eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa - "very chronic and difficult illnesses with often fatal outcomes," Boachie says. Most people who develop eating disorders were never overweight or obese to begin with, he says. "Eating disorders are illnesses. If any parent has any weight concerns, instead of listening to the street definition of obesity contact the experts," Boachie says. A recent study found that girls who eat at least five meals a week with their family are less likely to be preoccupied with dieting. Signs a child or teen might be engaged in extreme dieting or have an eating disorder include coming home from school and saying they have already eaten, separating themselves from family at mealtimes, and complaining of being cold and tired all the time. Younger children often don't stop eating completely, but they eat less, or complain their stomach hurts or they're not hungry. "Don't forget, they're small to start with. Losing a few kilos is enough to lose a significant proportion of their body weight," says Pinhas, of Sick Kids in Toronto. "What we end up seeing sometimes are kids who just stop growing." 
 The insignificance of a number by AISLINN THOMAS, Toronto Globe and Mail January 14, 2008 No figure from a scale can articulate the fear, hardship and courage of my struggle with anorexia For some months, I've been experiencing pain from a herniated disc. At an appointment with a specialist, the physician asked me about my medical history. As I have come to expect, he was more curious than educated about my condition. The ensuing conversation was a minefield. I told him I am in recovery from anorexia. "Is that all fixed?" he asked. I tried to explain it is a continuing process, that recovery from an eating disorder is complex. He suggested that, like an addiction, it is something that one struggles with for life. I tried to explain that isn't necessarily the case. Then he asked me the question I dread the most: "What was your lowest weight, if you don't mind me asking?" I do mind. While in the acute stages of anorexia weight can be one of several useful measures in determining medical risk, there are many reasons why this question pains me each time I hear it. I am not in the acute stages of anorexia - my weight has been stable for 2½ years. Still, this question evokes a time when my body was the only voice I knew how to use. It reactivates a part of my brain that insists I never did lose enough weight and that my weight never successfully reflected the intensity of pain and crisis I was experiencing. These are thoughts I know it is best to disregard. When asked this question now, I am acutely aware that no number can articulate the complexity of my experience over the past seven years. When someone asks me what my weight was, I feel silenced. He or she is not interested in me as a person, is not interested in hearing the real story. There are, of course, many versions of the real story of my eating disorder: There are two-minute versions and two-hour versions; some that last late into the night; and some that are interrupted by tears or accompanied by impassioned gestures. There are my favourite versions of the story, which build slowly over time and are shared over the tenacity of friendship. Like most stories, this one never ends; it evolves and changes constantly. A number cannot summarize or even begin to approach the reality of the fear, hardship, destruction, courage, persistence and insight that has punctuated my life. It doesn't address what has been the gift of my struggle, doesn't speak to the way my fight with anorexia broke me open, tore me apart and made me permeable to the world in a way that I had been running from for years. It cannot articulate the way my experience has forced me to face the darkest places within myself, and invited me to enter into a process of reconciliation with our uncertain and only world. A number denies me the opportunity to share something really worth sharing. A number grips my stomach and breaks my heart because I could offer so much more, if you were willing to listen. Recently, I met with my counsellor for what may be the last time. For years, I've been in therapy and never imagined a time when it wouldn't be necessary for my survival. My counsellor asked me if I had had any expectations of what my life would look like when I no longer needed therapy. I told her I didn't. Yet I distinctly remember the time when I was first becoming dedicated to the task of caring for myself. One of the things that got me through this rocky terrain was the illusion that waiting for me, after all this hard and terrifying work, would be a life that was easeful and happy. My counsellor and I talked about how life will always have its hard parts. More important is how one copes with them. After the session, I stepped back internally and saw, really saw, that I happen to be coping well, that I am participating in life in a way that was once no more than a distant and vague imagining. I cried at my astonishment. I cried for this confusing and precious journey, and I cried for the realization that I am, and was always, okay. That evening, I saw the Northern Lights - tall, pale columns extending from where trees meet sky, dancing ever so softly in the night. They were faint enough that I wondered if they were really there and bright enough that I delighted in the presence of such magic. I was utterly captivated. It filled me in a way that made me know I was alive; that made me feel complete in all my fumbling. In the spaciousness of that moment, past and future dropped away, and right now was rich, and palpable, and enough. If you asked me to tell you what it was like, I would gladly. If you asked me to tell you how much I weighed, I would explain that we are all so much more than that; that really, there is no measure. I would ask how much time you had and offer you, instead, a story. Aislinn Thomas lives in Guelph, Ont. 
 I have been wondering during this latest relapse of mine whether I'm more anorexic or bulimic...and whether it really matters. I'm comfortable with the generic term "eating disorder", but since the labels are out there, I feel a need to know. Back when I was diagnose with anorexia, I purged occasionally (particularly when I had to eat around people) and sometimes I "pigged out" on a few teaspoons of fat free frozen yogurt and then threw up. Now I still purge...much more often than before...I feel like restricting would be easier if my family weren't around watching. I try to eat normally in front of them and then throw up (when I can't pretend I have eaten). I want my parents to think things are ok, so I don't skip meals when they're around. I'm at around 85% of my "ideal" body weight, but I feel like I'm more prone to eating more than I'd like to, even when my parents aren't watching and then throwing up. I'm afraid it's becoming more of a concern for me, and unfortunately I can't seem to find any other way of coping with what I eat other than purging. If I really do have a binge-eating impulse problem, then I'd like to be able to address that. Is it common for people's eating disorders to evolve into something else if there's a change in environments? LIke in my case, I think the reason I'm purging more now is because I'm always surrounded by people and purging is easier to hide than a blatant refusal to eat. Does that make me bulimic now? 
 Anti-alcohol drug promising for binge eaters Mon Dec 24, 2007 By Anthony J. Brown, MD NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The results of a small study suggest that the muscle-relaxing drug baclofen may help curb binge eating episodes in women with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. "This is the first study, to our knowledge, that studies baclofen's use in binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa in a systematic manner," Dr. Allegra I. Broft, from Columbia University in New York, who led the study, told Reuters Health. Baclofen has been shown to safely and effectively keep alcoholics away from alcohol. "We became interested in baclofen," Broft explained, "because of its potential role in treating substance use disorders; thus, we chose it from a theoretical viewpoint that suggests that binge eating disorders and substance use disorders may have some common underlying roots, and that a medicine that helps one might help the other." The study, which is reported in the International Journal of Eating Disorders, involved four women with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder (a.k.a., BED) and three women with bulimia who were treated with baclofen at a dose of 60 milligrams per day. Six of the women completed the 10-week trial. Three women with BED and two with bulimia experienced a 50 percent or greater drop off in binge eating frequency during the course of the study. Moreover, two BED patients and one bulimia patient were completely free of binge eating at week 10. Baclofen was well tolerated by the women in the study and four of the women elected to continue the drug after the study ended. "Baclofen," Broft said, "may be of utility for treatment of conditions like BED and bulimia nervosa, though a larger, more definitive trial is needed at this point."

 Males With A Female Twin May Be At Higher Risk For Anorexia Nervosa ScienceDaily (Dec. 4, 2007)  Males who have a twin sister appear more likely to develop the eating disorder anorexia nervosa than other males, including those with a twin brother, according to a new report. This finding supports the hypothesis that exposure to female sex hormones in the womb may be related to the risk for anorexia nervosa. "Anorexia nervosa is approximately 10 times more common in females than in males," the authors write as background information in the article. "The reasons for this difference are not known, and it is likely that their unraveling will represent an important step forward in the understanding of the etiopathogenetic factors involved in the development of eating disorders." Marco Procopio, M.D., M.R.C.Psych., of the University of Sussex, Brighton, England, and Paul Marriott, Ph.D., of the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, analyzed data from a study of Swedish twins born between 1935 and 1958. Two sets of diagnostic criteria, one broader and one more narrow, were used to determine which twins had anorexia nervosa. Overall, female twins were more likely than male twins to develop anorexia nervosa. The one exception was among males who had a dizygotic (fraternal) twin sister. "In fact, their risk is at a level that is not statistically significantly different from that of females from such a pair," the authors write. Among 4,478 dizygotic opposite-sex twins, 20 females and 16 males had anorexia nervosa using narrow criteria and 32 females and 27 males qualified under the broad criteria. Risk for these female twins was not significantly different from than that of other female twins. "A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that in pregnancies bearing a female fetus, a substance is produced, probably hormonal, that increases the risk of having anorexia nervosa in adulthood," the authors write. "Because the male half of an opposite-sex twin pair would also be exposed to this substance, it could account for the observed elevated risk in males with female twins. The most likely candidates are sex steroid hormones." "The results of our study are compatible with the hypothesis that intrauterine exposure to sex hormones might influence neurodevelopment, affecting the risk of developing anorexia nervosa in adult life," they conclude. "This might be a factor contributing to the higher risk of developing anorexia nervosa in females." Journal reference: Arch Gen Psychiatry. 2007;64(12):1402-1408.

 Competitive Sports Threaten Girls With Eating Disorders Monday, November 05, 2007 Despite the litany of health issues bettered by regular exercise, strenuous workouts may prove dangerous to patients affected by major eating disorders, especially when they take the form of intense and competitive cardiovascular activities like varsity long distance running. The unfortunate workout/disorder equation works both ways: Runners can develop eating disorders as a result of the supposed performance benefits of low body weight while those with pre-existing dietary issues use their workouts as yet another tool to satisfy their irrational and potentially fatal fear of weight gain. These pathological concerns do not necessarily amount to anorexia or bulimia, but the absence of a particularly common label does not negate the physical and psychological damage they entail. As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote in an expansive report this weekend, girls who run competitively are particularly susceptible to the "female athlete triaddisordered eating, osteoporosis (loss of bone mass), and amenorrhea (loss of menstruation)," in addition to "anemia (red blood cell deficiency), abnormally slow heart rate and heart, kidney and liver damage." Unlike sports such as wrestling in which weight plays a significant role in competition, wiry and very thin bodies are the natural results of competitive running, particularly that of the long-distance variety, and low BMIs very often go unnoticed; discerning eating disorders based on appearance alone may prove surprisingly difficult in a field where low body weight makes for optimum performance. But the consecutive deaths of three weight-obsessed college wrestlers one decade ago highlight the dangers of the extreme measures some athletes take in order to maintain their ideal weight; though more prevalent among young women, these problems are not unique to female athletes. Some coaches have voiced concern over putting runners on the scale and emphasizing their weight, especially when the runners in question are high-school and college-aged girls who already face the nearly unbearable stresses of adolescent and peer acceptance every day. But NCAA reports have previously noted more incidents of anorexia and bulimia among female cross country teams than in any other discipline. The success and praise that accompany victory on the course often serve to reinforce the appeal of dramatic weight loss. In the midst of such adulation, athletes can dismiss their eating disorders by pointing to their athletic success as evidence of their superior health. Studies often prove unreliable as athletes are even more reluctant than most to report eating disorders, most likely due to the emphasis on personal discipline and physical endurance that so often characterize competitive sports. The 2005 death of a track champion due to complications related to anorexia led to a brief nationwide focus on the issues raised by the dietary patterns of competitive athletes, providing a tragic examples of the damages wrought by the unfortunate meeting of competition and disordered eating. At the time of her death, Alex Devinny was 20 years old, 5"8' tall, and weighed only 70 pounds. Very well-trained, professional runners whose positions depend on very strict training and nutritional guidelines have been known to collapse and, in the most extreme cases, die while training or running in competition. Though their injuries often stem from medical complications and pre-existing conditions, they clearly illustrate the severe strain often forced upon the body by such demanding activity. Singling runners out for their weight, even if they need to gain rather than lose body mass, may prove disruptive in a population already obsessed with the very same. Even though many eating-disorder patients will be proud of their weight loss, admonishments may only serve to reinforce the obsession and will probably not deter the deep-seated dissatisfaction so crucial to active eating disorders. The health of each individual athlete is ultimately far more important than team victory or record-setting performances. In a discipline so susceptible to problem cases, coaches should pay a little more attention to the habits of their runners and report suspected eating disorders to sports therapists or mental health professionals. The young women under their supervision may initially resent these actions, but such interventions have the potential to save lives. 
 Management of Eating Disorders in Children and Teens by Laurie Barclay, MD October 17, 2007 "The eating disorders, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and their variants, typically develop in adolescence or early adulthood, mainly in females," write Simon G. Gowers, professor of Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of Liverpool, United Kingdom. "Despite a long history, the evidence base for effective treatments is weak and existing clinical guidelines are based on consensus views rather than strong research. Effective coordinated management of physical and psychological aspects of the disorders is crucial, but outcomes remain very variable, with adverse outcomes commonly extending into adulthood." Anorexia nervosa carries a high morbidity and occasional mortality. It may begin at about 8 years of age, peaking at about 15 to 18 years. Self-imposed restriction of calorific foods, exercise, vomiting, or purging results in weight loss or failure to thrive. Body weight remains at least 15% below age norms, with stunted or reversed pubertal development, and delayed menarche or secondary amenorrhea. Anorexia nervosa is usually associated with poor self-esteem, feelings of ineffectiveness, depressive and anxiety features, poor concentration, obsessional symptoms, and waning social interest. Although bulimia nervosa seldom begins before 13 years of age, by young adulthood, prevalence is greater than that of anorexia nervosa. Bulimia nervosa is characterized by a persistent preoccupation with eating, accompanied by craving and binges. Weight is maintained in normal range by self-induced vomiting or purging. Compared with adolescents with anorexia nervosa, those with bulimia nervosa may be less perfectionistic and socially withdrawn but more apt to engage in drug and alcohol misuse. Atypical forms of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are more prevalent than full syndrome disorders. Other clinical eating disturbances in this age group may include selective eating, as well as other phobic and obsessional disorders presenting with eating disturbances, which differ from anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa in core psychopathology and management. In addition to thorough history with both patient and parents individually, and complete physical examination, assessment tools may include Child versions of the Eating Attitudes Test (ChEAT) and the Eating Disorder Examination. "It is helpful to take an approach which is respectful and age-appropriate but recognises the role of parents in providing a developmental history, their perspective on the problem and their potential role in treatment," the author writes. "Time should be taken with the young person alone to enable a sympathetic understanding of their own point of view and a full assessment of their mental state including cognition and risk. Family, social or educational stressors which may be acting as maintaining factors should be explored." Evaluation may include determining the extent of malnutrition and electrolyte disturbance from vomiting or purging; electrocardiogram if the patient is emaciated; tests for muscle weakness; luteinizing hormone (LH) levels and their response to LH-releasing factor; ovarian ultrasonography to evaluate ovarian maturity; and levels of growth hormone, cortisol, and insulin secretion. Differential diagnosis may include normal dieting; hyperthyroidism, diabetes, or other physical or psychological illnesses; organic causes of diarrhea, such as idiopathic steatorrhea or inflammatory bowel disease; ovarian or pituitary disease causing amenorrhoea; or depressive and obsessional symptoms. There are no large scale randomized controlled drug trials in anorexia nervosa at any age, but preliminary findings suggest that olanzapine may be well tolerated, resulting in weight gain, improved compliance with treatment, and decreased agitation and mealtime anxiety. A recent Cochrane review did not recommend antidepressants in anorexia nervosa. "There is then, as yet little empirical support for the use of psychopharmacological interventions targeted at AN [anorexia nervosa] specifically," the author writes. "Nonetheless, for those with high levels of anxiety, obsessionality, or mood disorder, the use of either atypical antipsychotics selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants or both may be clinically useful." However, in adults with bulimia nervosa, antidepressant drugs appear to have an "antibulimic" effect, often resulting in a rapid decline in the frequency of binge eating and purging and in improved mood. Despite the lack of agreement regarding oral feeding requirements, weight gain goals are around 1 kg/week for inpatients and 0.5 kg/week for outpatients, with adjustment after an initial safe weight has been achieved to ensure that growth is in line with normal weight and height trajectories. Nasogastric feeding should only be a last resort for patients who persistently refuse normal eating. Strict behavioral regimes are not effective and may be perceived by the young person as coercive, abusive, or reinforcing low self-esteem. Clinicians must avoid inducing the refeeding syndrome, a rare, potentially fatal fluid and electrolyte disturbance that may follow sudden increases in nutritional intake in patients near starvation, especially with parenteral nutrition. Regular monitoring of vital signs and serum electrolytes, including phosphorous, glucose, magnesium, and potassium are essential. Individual psychological therapies have little research evidence to support them. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on modifying the behavior and ways of thinking that maintain the eating disorder. CBT usually involves about 20 individual treatment sessions for 5 months and has been shown to be the most effective treatment for adults with bulimia nervosa. Family therapy is the most studied intervention for adolescents with anorexia nervosa. This at first focuses on behavioral change around eating to promote weight gain. Parents are advised to offer support and commitment to refeeding. Hospital admission for the severely malnourished young person allows physical health monitoring, introduction of normal eating habits, intensive psychological therapy, and respite for the family. Potential harms of admission may include disruption of schooling and family life and difficulty ensuring continuity of care after discharge. "Recent developments have seen a growth in family based treatments and evidence-based individual therapeutic approaches, including motivational treatments," the author concludes. "Clear guidance on the most effective treatments is hampered by a lack of quality treatment studies. However a wealth of experience has contributed to valuable clinical guidelines to direct management in both a paediatric and mental health setting." This study received no external funding, and the author has disclosed no relevant financial relationships. Clinical Context Eating disorders, which comprise anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and their variants, tend to occur in adolescence or early adulthood, mainly in females. The evidence base for the efficacy of treatments is weak, with effective coordinated care recommended, but outcomes are still variable and the condition often persists into adulthood with a high morbidity. This is a review of the clinical features and types of eating disorders and discusses pharmacologic, psychological, psychosocial, and in-hospital strategies for management. Study Highlights Eating disorders comprise anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and associated disorders.Anorexia nervosa develops from age 8 years, reaching a peak at 15 to 18 years, whereas bulimia nervosa is rare for those younger than 13 years and becomes more common in adulthood.The eating disorder syndromes comprise a range of physical, psychological, and behavioral features.In bulimia nervosa, persistent preoccupation with food and binges are more dominant behaviors.Cyclical bingeing and purging and missing meals is a feature of bulimia nervosa.In anorexia nervosa, body weight is maintained at least 15% below expected, and pubertal development is stunted or reversed.Delay in menarche or amenorrhea may occur.In anorexia nervosa, the dominant feature is cognitive distortion with self-worth dependent on the ability to restrict food intake and there is no loss of appetite with weight loss seen as an achievement.Dieting may be an expression of competitiveness or battle of wills, and self-induced vomiting and laxative abuse may be practiced by a subgroup.Young persons may present with emaciation, starvation, menstrual disturbance, or dietary disturbance.The ChEAT and the Eating Disorder Examination are screening tools that recognized parents' roles and patients' motivations.For anorexia nervosa, the degree of malnutrition should be assessed together with electrolyte disturbance associated with vomiting and bingeing or purging.Body mass index should be assessed against age-appropriate norms, and temperature, pulse, and blood pressure and electrocardiogram measured.Comorbidities and differential diagnoses to be considered include obsessive-compulsive disorders or symptoms, depression, and psychotic illnesses.There are no large scale randomized trials to demonstrate efficacy of any pharmacologic agents for anorexia nervosa.Preliminary findings suggest that olanzapine is well tolerated and associated with weight gain and overall decrease in agitation and mealtime anxiety.Fluoxetine may reduce the rate of relapse after inpatient management, but findings have not been replicated.Patients with eating disorders and concurrent anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social phobia may benefit from atypical antipsychotics or antidepressants.For bulimia nervosa, antidepressants may be linked with a decline in frequency of binge eating and purging, but results have not been shown to be sustained.There is a lack of consensus about refeeding requirements.The refeeding syndrome describes a potentially life-threatening disturbance of fluid and electrolyte imbalance linked with rapid nutritional intake after starvation; close monitoring is advocated during refeeding.Among psychological approaches, CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy, and transtheoretical models of change have been used to modify eating behaviors.A recent emphasis on outpatient family therapy has resulted in greater evaluation of this strategy.For inpatient management, age-appropriate facilities are recommended with active consent of patients and participation by family members.Inpatient psychiatric care varies internationally with a combination of nutritional rehabilitation, family therapies, psychosocial rehabilitation, and psychotherapy.Specialized day patient treatment units usually offer attendance for 4 to 7 days with supervised meals and concurrent individual, family, and medical and pharmacologic management. 
 Eating disorders can lead to pregnancy trouble By: Ivanhoe Broadcast News An unhealthy diet and lifestyle can negatively impact a woman's chances of conceiving, and if she is able to conceive she may not be able to carry the baby to term. Having an eating disorder can be a difficult situation to overcome while trying to have a baby. One study out of Denmark found that even if women receive treatment for an eating disorder up to eight years before pregnancy their chances of having a high-risk pregnancy are just as great as women who sought treatment immediately before becoming pregnant. According to Anorexia Nervosa and Related Eating Disorders, Inc. (ANRED), about 20 percent of women in the United States who seek treatment at fertility clinics have an eating disorder. Babies born to women who suffer from an eating disorder are commonly born prematurely. Premature birth usually means the baby has low birth weight, and in some cases hasn't finished developing properly. Some of the problems that can be associated with premature and low birth weight babies in some cases include lower IQ, learning disabilities, cerebral palsy, lung disease and psychiatric illness. Some women with eating disorders welcome pregnancy, thinking of it as a biologically acceptable reason to gain weight. While it's a nice vacation from weight obsession for some women with eating disorders, for others putting on prenatal pounds sounds terrifying. If you have a history of an eating disorder and would like to have a child in a healthy way, there are several things to try. According to ANRED you should talk to your doctor about nutritional concerns, and once you become pregnant, follow prenatal instructions as closely as you can. Talking with a councilor could be very beneficial when it comes to facing your fears of gaining weight. Taking childhood development classes will help you gain an understanding of the factors that go into prenatal development. Learning that your baby's development and well being, while in the womb, is completely dependent on your habits may have you thinking differently about the way you eat and your lifestyle choices in general. 
 Eating Disorders the Same Between Overweight and Thin Teens By Stacie Overton Johnson ORLANDO, Fla. (Ivanhoe Newswire) -- New research shows risk factors are the same for both being overweight and eating disorders. Researchers from the University of Minnesota interviewed 2,516 teens about dietary habits, exercise, exposure to weight-related messages, family meals and whether or not peers or family members teased them about their weight. The researchers followed up with the teens and asked the same questions five years later. About 25 percent of the teens in the study were overweight. Results of the study show 40 percent of the overweight girls and 20 percent of the overweight boys in the study were involved with extreme weight control behaviors like vomiting or taking diet pills to lose weight. One of the biggest risk factors for extreme weight control behavior in overweight teens was a history of teasing. Teasing by family members was worse than teasing by peers. Teens who were teased by family members had double the risk of being overweight five years later. Dianne Neumark-Sztainer, Ph.D., from the University of Minnesota, says experts typically look for extreme weight control behaviors in very thin girls, but these results show its also a concern for overweight girls. Neumark-Sztainer tells Ivanhoe, The findings were stronger than I expected. It points to a need for extreme sensitivity when dealing with overweight kids. Neumark-Sztainer says parents often talk at home about eating and weight. But she tells Ivanhoe, My message is talk less, do more. If you put healthy food on the table, kids will eat it. Neumark-Sztainers book, titled: Im, Like, SO Fat! Helping Your Teen Make Healthy Choices about Eating and Exercise in a Weight-Obsessed World helps parents deal with weight-related problems in their kids. 
 Hi everyone. I've been having a bit of a problem with eating, and would be most grateful for advice. I lost a lot of weight over the past year. I was always quite slim, but I started to get so thin that people I worked with actually approached my manager with concern. I never had a problem with food before, and I'm not obsessively concerned with how I look (well, I'm a bit of a slob, really!). It feels so pathetic to say it, but I think I first lost my appetite because I fell in love. A year later, and it didn't work out. The last few weeks have been really tough (trying to get over this relationship not working out), and in the months toward the end, my appetite was gone again. I've been so anxious I've actually vomited once or twice, and the thought of eating more than a couple of mouthfuls makes me want to gag. I was prescribed mirtazapine some months ago for depression and anxiety (longstanding problems) and at first it did help with the appetite (a lot!), but that has worn off. I'm just getting slightly nervous about this problem with eating and I want to stop it getting any worse. I was just hoping for some tips on how to get over the gagging feeling, like my throat is closing, and just get eating properly again! With thanks. (I hope it was ok to put this message in this part of the forum?) 
 Naomi Hooke: A thin excuse Tuesday 18, September 2007 Belfast Telegraph It was two days before Christmas, and for the third time in my 20-year-long existence I found myself having my blood pressure monitored, my blood taken for biochemical analysis and my mental state being assessed for risk of self-harm and suicide. Once again, I'd been admitted to an eating disorder unit, rescued from my own little world of self-destruction. The day before, I had filled my every hour with food (or rather the avoiding of it), exercise, my ongoing obsession with academic work, and fantasies about a future where I wouldn't be there to spoil everything. My parents came to visit, my younger sister excited in anticipation of present-opening. It hurt to sit up, and hurt to lie down, yet I refused to believe that this was due to starvation and muscle wastage. My family brought me a stocking, but I couldn't understand how they would ever think I deserved nice things. I left the presents unopened for over a month. I'd suffered from anorexia to varying degrees since I was 11, hiding food and concealing my body under layer upon layer of clothing, and once again it had caught up with me. As London Fashion Week continues, the controversy surrounding "size zero" models is once again up for discussion. Prompted by the Madrid ban on models with a BMI below 18.5, fashion capitals around the world have undertaken enquiries into the links between eating disorders and the catwalk. Although any measure to protect models at risk of eating disorders is to be applauded, to believe that the fashion industry causes eating disorders is to completely misunderstand this most complex of illnesses. At 11, I was showing early signs of puberty, and the prospect of an adult life ahead terrified me. I was afraid of responsibility, of a time when I would have to face the world without my parents' hands to hold. But most of all I was scared of men and sex. Throughout my illness, even when I was motivated, I was convinced that recovery was impossible. But miracles do happen. I was in the grip of anorexia nervosa for more than eight years, but with a lot of help from family, friends and professionals I was able to turn my life around. Anorexia has often been perceived as a quest for model-like beauty, as a teenage fad or as a diet gone wrong. It has even been described as a lifestyle choice. Seldom is anorexia acknowledged as the life-threatening medical condition that it is. Many anorexics detest their bodies, refusing even to pose for family holiday snaps. I, like many of the eating disorder patients I have met, never sought beauty; instead, I spent years trying to make myself look as ill as possible in order to avoid male attention. As far back as I can remember, my self-esteem was low and I lacked confidence. Children can be cruel, and although they weren't the "cause" of my eating problems, the bullying I endured throughout my schooldays only added to my feelings of self-hatred. It is often assumed that the distress in anorexia revolves solely around food and weight. However, the vast majority of eating disorder patients have numerous other difficulties, including low self-esteem or confidence, lack of self-care, and social difficulties. Sufferers are often presumed to pour over the pages of glossy magazines and starve themselves in their aspiration to become glamorous, thinner-than-thin sex goddesses. From my own experiences and from those of numerous other eating disorder patients I have met, I can say unequivocally that nothing could be further from the truth. Beauty has very little to do with eating disorders, and the desire to be thin is merely one of many symptoms. Rarely can a single "cause" be identified. On the ward, Christmas had been and gone, and it was beginning to dawn on me that I would not be well enough to return to university. I was convinced that, once again, I had failed. During those weeks, I hit rock bottom. After years of pretending, I finally opened up to staff at the hospital, and began speaking about some of my troubling innermost thoughts. I had never felt so ill; the pain was excruciating. My memories of this hellish period are sketchy, but I have since been told that my kidneys were failing and that I was at risk of cardiac arrest. I had many meetings with the doctors, and eventually I agreed to be fed via nasal gastric tube. It was horrible when they passed the tube, though deep down I know it probably saved my life. It was at this point that something flicked inside my head. It was as though I'd "swapped sides": I stopped fighting everyone who was trying to help me. As the weeks went on, my stomach ached as it was stretched to accommodate food again. It still took me hours to eat a bowl of soup, and I still had a tube up my nose, but nevertheless, things were getting better. I wasn't an easy patient. I cried and screamed and threatened to run away. But in spite of everything, staff at the hospital never gave up on me, and I'll remain eternally grateful for every hug and kind word. Although my first trip home was challenging, it did open my eyes. At last I began to see how much anorexia was holding me back. I was getting stronger, thinking more logically, and perhaps most importantly my sense of ambition was returning. I started to dream about getting back to university and one day being able to help people with mental illness myself. I spent seven months as an in-patient and two more as a day patient. I regained a healthy body weight, spent numerous hours discussing my underlying fears and was slowly beginning to develop a sense of self-worth. My fall into the dark world of anorexia was never influenced by fashion or waif-like celebrities, though I knew others whose recovery from life-threatening illness was indeed hindered by the Western world's culture of thinness. I believe that the British Fashion Council's guidelines will go some way to protect the models themselves (of whom 40 per cent are said to suffer from eating disorders). However, I see problems both with the approach taken in Madrid of banning models with a BMI under 18.5, and the recent health certification scheme proposed in Britain. Although BMI can offer a crude measure of physical health, it can never quantify psychological distress. Despite popular belief, low weight is not the only danger of eating disorders. There have been times in my life in which my BMI has been in the healthy range and yet my eating behaviours and mental state were far from healthy. I would starve myself for days on end before my body gave in to the pains of hunger and I would binge, after which I would feel so disgusted with myself that I would make myself vomit and/or cut myself with razor blades. As for doctors' certificates, it takes considerable time and skill to assess whether an individual has an eating disorder, not least because sufferers often go to great lengths to hide their illness. I've been there, told the lies and tricked the scales. It is a fact that a higher proportion of models suffer from eating disorders than do the general population. The "grooming" and competitive atmosphere undoubtedly perpetuate eating disorders within the modelling profession, but I am personally of the opinion that young girls with existing eating disorders are selected by modelling agencies because of their tiny figures. But, although the fashion industry may be rife with anorexia, the majority of eating disorder patients have not become ill through catwalk influences. And nor are they models. 
 Pro-anorexia websites hurt viewers' self-esteem Friday, September 14, 2007 By Anne Harding NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - No matter what their weight or their eating habits, young women feel worse about themselves and their appearance after viewing pro-anorexia websites, which explicitly encourage extreme thinness, a new study shows. "It works on a couple of levels, it works on mood, it works on your body image," said Dr. Anna M. Bardone-Cone of the University of Missouri in Columbia, one of the study's authors. "Everyone's affected." Bardone-Cone and her colleague Kamila M. Cass suggest that parents may want to take steps to prevent their children from viewing such sites, by blocking access to them and by keeping any household computers in open areas so they can supervise their use, for example. So-called "pro-ana" websites have been in the media spotlight recently, the two investigators note in their report in the International Journal of Eating Disorders. Health professionals have expressed concerns that the sites, which include "thinspiration" photos of skeletal models and "Tips and Tricks" for losing weight, may be harmful to viewers. To investigate, Bardone-Cone and Cass created a "prototypic" pro-ana website, and randomly assigned 235 female college students to view it, or a fashion website featuring normal-weight models, or a site on home decor. Fourteen percent of the study participants met criteria for having a possible eating disorder, while about 17 percent were overweight. After looking at the anorexia-promoting Web site, young women had worse moods, worse social self-esteem, and a worse sense of their ability to cope with their appearance than those who viewed one of the other two websites. They also thought of themselves as heavier and said they were more likely to exercise and think about their weight in the near future. The effect was the same whether or not women were actually overweight, and whether or not they reported possibly disordered eating behavior. Many women who view pro-ana websites may not have active eating disorders, but are instead looking for weight loss tips or are simply curious, Bardone-Cone noted. "If I were the parent of a daughter, I'd definitely have concerns about that." She added that the findings confirm "there's stuff on the Internet that really kids shouldn't be seeing."

 Obsession with exercise can become disorder By Anissa Orr Are you exercise obsessed or just an avid exercise enthusiast? That depends on your attitude, say mental health experts. If you exercise frequently because you enjoy it and you like the health benefits it provides, you have the right reasons in mind. If you exercise because you feel compelled to do so and in spite of having injuries, you may be at risk for developing an exercise disorder. "There is no set formula or standard that reveals how much exercising is too much," said Theresa Fassihi, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Baylor College of Medicine and a psychologist with the Eating Disorders Program at The Menninger Clinic. "But if exercising is interfering in a person's life and it is compulsory, then it may be a problem." Who is at risk? Fassihi treats patients in the Eating Disorders Program who overexercise in an attempt to burn off calories, build muscle or attain physical perfection. It is common for patients with exercise disorders to also have an eating disorder, Fassihi said. Problems occur when body perception doesn't match reality. People involved in activities or professions that require physical beauty or high levels of physical performance  such as athletes and dancers  are particularly vulnerable to developing exercise disorders. High achievers with perfectionist personalities are also vulnerable. Both men and women can have an exercising disorder, but they often have different goals for their exercise regimens. Women seek the "lean look" and typically exercise aerobically to become thin. Men want to bulk up and lift weights to increase muscle mass. "If you have an exercising disorder, you also may be very preoccupied about your body's appearance, weight and muscle mass," Fassihi said. "You spend a lot of time looking at yourself, scrutinizing yourself, measuring yourself and constantly working out to create the muscle mass or lean body that you want." Distorted body image, also called body dysmorphia, is a common component of an exercising disorder. Persons with body dysmorphia have a distorted view and exaggerated vision of their appearance  thin women may think they are too big, and muscular men may think they are too scrawny. The obsession with being too small or frail is a subtype of body dysmorphia called muscle dysmorphia, nicknamed bigorexia, which is most common in men. Effects of overexercising Many people with exercise disorders also restrict their calories, based on the mistaken belief that they will build a higher proportion of muscle if they restrict their food intake while exercising, Fassihi said. Instead, they lose both muscle and fat, putting their health at risk. "Overexercising can cause significant damage to the body," Fassihi adds. "It can increase the risk of injuries for both men and women. Women may be more at risk for osteoporosis if they are overexercising and restricting their food intake, and they may stop menstruating completely. Men may use steroids and protein powders to help them achieve their goals, leading to other health problems." Overexercising can also cause stress fractures and constant repetitive exercise can cause wear and tear on the body's muscle, bones and joints  in severe cases making joint replacement surgery necessary at a young age. Treating the problem can be complex Many who overexercise are reluctant to admit their behavior is problematic, Fasshi said. Exercise provides them with a sense of control, power and, in some cases, superiority. Exercise also relieves anxiety and releases endorphins, which provide a sense of euphoria. Because of the positive aspects of exercise and its value in an achievement and appearance oriented-society, treatment for exercise disorders can be difficult. "If you give up an addiction that is bad for you, you give it up cold turkey. However, you can't give up exercise completely, because it is healthy," Fassihi said. "You want to learn how to exercise moderately in a healthy way. That's very tough without help from a professional." Staff members with the Eating Disorders Program at Menninger work with patients who overexercise to help them recognize normal levels of exercise. At the beginning of treatment, patients are limited to the mildest physical activity, such as walking, in an attempt to increase their body weight to normal levels. As treatment progresses, patients may increase their amount of exercise. By the time they leave Menninger, patients are exercising moderately every other day, for about four hours a week. Patients discover toll of overexercising Men and women also learn to confront their anxiety about not exercising and learn other methods to help them relieve their anxiety  like relaxation and breathing exercises. They may also participate in a body image group to identify negative beliefs they have about their bodies and how to dispute those beliefs. With treatment, patients realize the toll that overexercising has taken on their lives. "Overexercising interferes with their quality of life because they devote so much of their time to exercise to the exclusion of anything else," Fassihi said. "Their time is not available for socializing, relationships or work. It is all consuming." 
 You Can't Ban 'Em All by JaneCopland Fri (8/10/07) The Times Online is reporting today that "charities involved with eating disorders" are asking sites like YouTube and MySpace to ban or remove groups and videos that glorify and promote afflictions such as anorexia. While neither service is showing much interest in censoring their weight-obsessed members, the idea that organizations can lobby for the removal of legal content is a larger matter. You may think anorexia is tragic, stupid, selfish, or a combination of all three, but as far as I know, there's nothing illegal about it. There's plenty immoral, but there's nothing illegal about promoting it either. The problem with removing content on MySpace, YouTube, et al based on its immorality is that everyone has different moral standards. Do you really want every "charity," non-profit, or political lobbyist to have a say in what you're allowed to own and view online? Most websites that include user-generated content have ways in which other members can report content as unsavory. Reddit lets members report comments that are offensive, but even Reddit's most offensive member never sees his oft-reported comments removed or censored (link NSFW in soooo many ways). It seems that you can get kicked off Digg for having someone from the same IP as you even look at a story you dugg, but calling other members horrible names and swearing up a storm doesn't appear to be against the rules. Of course, there are examples of legal content that should be removed. Facebook representative Kate* states that the Facebook staff "review the reports and remove material that we consider a violation of our Terms of Service" when they're notified about objectionable content. Kate goes on to say, "One phenomenon I've found is that "chapters" of groups will spring up at many different schools. Thus, there was a template... that was copied by groups across the site." The groups Facebook removes, however, are usually engaging in hate-speech against races or religions. Removing content that isn't hateful or threatening widens an already expansive gray area. Bigots already argue their right to free speech. Their case is hardly convincing in the eyes of either the public or the law, but the free speech case of extra-thin teenagers is a bit stronger. They're not advocating that girls should purposely starve their friends or children, after all. The idea that these charities can influence sites like MySpace also sends out a dangerous message that it's okay to lobby for content to be removed on the basis of belief. There is plenty of content out there that advocates atheism. Should churches be able to object to the public promotion of heresy? Should rival political groups be able to lobby social networks to shut down each other's forums? The recent deletion of a StumbleUpon group that reportedly discussed the existence / nonexistence of God was contested by Christians and Atheists alike for its apparent bias. According to all reports, the group had not violated StumbleUpon's terms of service. It's impossible to verify whether that's true, however: the group is gone. I have to stand behind these idiotic girls' choice to post their lengthy suicides online, not because I'm idealistically hugging a copy of the First Amendment, but because infringing on their right to promote their stupid-yet-legal activities has too much potential to morph into a go-ahead for every agenda-happy moron out there to cry "I object!" Besides, making these people take their videos and groups offline won't resolve their eating disorders. It won't prevent impressionable girls from seeing bony celebrities and swearing off all forms of nutrients, just like removing atheist groups won't turn everyone into church-goers. Just like removing racist content won't cure racism. However, we have to set boundaries in terms of which content should be removed and which is allowed to stay. As gag-inducing as some of it may be, we're going to have to put up with stuff we don't like. Now go eat a hamburger and be happy that you're not sixteen and insane. 
 Web sites serve up dangerous eating-disorders advice By Karen Pallarito, 07/24/07 They're called pro-eating-disorder Web sites. And many teens looking to lose weight  even those who don't need to  are logging on to these communities of individuals who engage in dangerous eating habits. Yet many parents aren't aware that the sites exist or that their children are visiting them, researchers have found. "Most parents would not endorse their child leaving the house at night, walking to an area of town that they themselves had never been in and meeting people that they themselves had never met," said the study author, Dr. Rebecka Peebles, an instructor in adolescent medicine at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University School of Medicine. "And I think that's actually what a lot of kids are doing online at home from their bedrooms." Potentially dangerous venues include Web sites where people who engage in disordered eating gather to discuss their activities. A majority of these sites have sections where people share tips and techniques "that I would consider as a physician fairly harmful," Peebles said. Complicating matters, sites that promote recovery from eating disorders also can be a source of weight-loss or purging techniques, the researchers found. Peebles and her colleagues sent questionnaires regarding Internet use and eating-disorder information to the parents of almost 700 people who had been evaluated for an eating disorder at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital between 1997 and 2004. A total of 182 responded, including 76 teens and 106 parents. Forty-one percent of the patients had visited a pro-eating-disorder Web site, while 36 percent had visited a pro-recovery Web site. One of the problems, Peebles explained, is that even forums designed to disseminate helpful information are constantly changing and may contain content that wasn't the author's original intent. "In our study, we did find that 96 percent of patients who visited (pro-eating-disorder) sites reported learning dieting tips and purging techniques from Web sites," she said. "However, nearly half of the people who visited pro-recovery Web sites also reported learning similar tips and techniques." Fift-two percent didn't know whether their children visited pro-eating-disorder Web sites, and 62.5 percent had no knowledge of pro-recovery sites. Half of parents of users of pro-eating-disorder Web sites either didn't know whether their child visited these sites while in treatment or thought their child did not visit these sites. Peebles said the findings, published in the journal Pediatrics, underscore the need for parents to educate themselves about the Internet so they can make guide their teens' Web activity. "I think a lot of parents are deciding by default not to be involved in their kids' online activities really, just because Google, in and of itself, is scary to them," she said. "Most of our kids are more savvy surfers than we are," agreed Cynthia M. Bulik, professor of eating disorders at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and director of the UNC Eating Disorders Program at UNC Hospitals. To help parents keep control, she tells them to "hone your own surfing skills" and "keep your family-access computer in a place where everyone can see what is being surfed." Parents also need to talk to their children about what they find on the Internet, Bulik advised. And if they learn that their child is visiting eating-disorder Web sites, they should talk about it. Bulik said, "I always tell parents, if your child comes home and says, "I'm going on a diet' or "I feel fat,' you should take it as seriously as if they were to come home and say, "I'm trying my first cigarette' or "I'm going to have a beer'  time to start the conversation!"
